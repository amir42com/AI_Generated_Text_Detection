Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson slams Saudi flags 'nonsense',"Ms Davidson tweeted that it was ""a steaming pile of nonsense"". Downing Street and other Whitehall departments were among those to put Union Flags at half mast after the death of 90-year-old King Abdullah. In a second tweet, Ms Davidson said it was a ""stupid act on its own and a stupid precedent to set"". The UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) sent out the request. Officials said it was a matter of protocol and that the formal request had been made by Buckingham Palace, which is also flying its flag at half mast. But the move caused disquiet because of the human rights record of the country during King Abdullah's reign. There has been recent outrage focused on the public beheading of a woman and a sentence of 1,000 lashes meted out to the creator of an online blog. The mark of respect was not adopted north of the border. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We offer the people of Saudi Arabia our condolences following the passing of King Abdullah. ""Flags are not routinely flown at half-mast from Scottish government buildings to mark the deaths of foreign heads of government or state."" Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the Scottish government had got it right. He said: ""I know there are all sorts of issues of protocol here. But when the sorts of things that happen in Saudi Arabia - a thousand lashes, the recent beheading of a woman. ""I think, all across Scotland - all across the UK - there will be a sense of bewilderment about it."" Ms Davidson's tweets came as Tory Prime Minister David Cameron and the Prince of Wales prepared to fly to Saudi Arabia to join international figures paying tribute to the king, who was seen as a crucial Western ally. Mr Cameron said that he was ""deeply saddened"" and that the ruler would be ""remembered for his long years of service to the kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths"". Former Tory MP Louise Mensch issued a foul-mouthed response to Mr Cameron's message of condolence to the Saudi royals and said she felt ""ashamed to be a Conservative"" until Ms Davidson spoke out. She said: ""It is so unacceptable to offer deep condolences for a man who flogged women, didn't let them drive, saw guardian laws passed & STARVES THEM"". ""I have been ashamed to be a Conservative today. Ruth Davidson has restored my faith. Somebody who truly stands for something."" The flags issue also split opinion between two of UKIP's key figures. Leader Nigel Farage said it showed ""respect for an ally in the war against terror"" and that the issue of human rights should be taken up with the new king. But MP Douglas Carswell said officials had seriously blundered and showed ""immoral"" values far from those of the British public.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dead soldiers in Powys served with Territorial Army,"A third soldier is in a serious condition after Saturday afternoon's incident, which is thought to have been linked to the hot weather. The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on reports they were taking part in an SAS selection process. It is understood live ammunition was not involved. Hottest day The Brecon Beacons is home to the Infantry Battle School and makes up one of the largest military training areas in Britain. The MoD has released little information about the two soldiers who died, but BBC News understands they were with the TA. An investigation into their deaths will focus on the weather conditions and the nature of the exercise the were involved in. The deaths occurred on the hottest day of the year so far in Wales, with temperatures reaching 30C (86F) in Powys. The MoD said in a statement: ""The MoD can confirm that it is working with Dyfed-Powys Police to investigate an incident during a training exercise on the Brecon Beacons on Saturday in which two members of military personnel died. ""The two servicemen's next of kin have been informed. More information will be released in due course but it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."" The Brecon Beacons forms one of Wales's national parks and is used for military training because of its relative remoteness. The infantry regiments of the British army train at Sennybridge in the area and there is an Army base in Brecon. 'Tough conditions' Mayor of Brecon and Powys county councillor Matthew Dorrance said: ""It's incredibly sad for the friends and family of the people who have lost their lives and thoughts are with the person who is injured. ""In one way we've been blessed with the weather but for people working in this heat, they're tough conditions."" Mr Dorrance said local people regularly saw troops training in the area and military vehicles parked on the side of the road. ""We're proud of our links with the military in the town,"" he said. Maj Alan Davies, who was involved in contingency planning during the first Gulf War, said the Beacons were used by ""all sorts of people for all sorts of things"". ""On one end of the spectrum you have cadets being taken for mountain walking and at the other end of the spectrum the SAS use it. It's one of the most challenging terrains,"" he said. Maj Davies said the men may have been carrying very heavy equipment and working to a deadline, which meant they would have been pushing themselves very hard.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Elon Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan,"The plans were presented at a council meeting on Monday by Jehn Balajadia, operations co-ordinator of the firm. She said: ""The purpose of Boring Company is to alleviate soul-destroying traffic and augment public transit."" Mr Musk, also chief of Tesla Inc and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, didn't speak at the meeting. A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: ""The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles. ""The tunnel would contain a high-speed underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported on autonomous electric skates travelling at 125-150mph."" The electric skates will be designed to carry either single passenger vehicles or what are described as ""mass transit"" pods capable of transporting between eight and 16 people. The company says the plan would ease road congestion and allow people to move around the city more easily. Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region. Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would ""build a tunnel boring machine"". The proposed route is from the headquarters of Musk's company SpaceX in Hawthorne to West Los Angeles passing underneath Sepulveda Boulevard through Culver City. The plans are reported to have been well-received by some members of the council as a way of dealing with the region's traffic congestion. However, concerns were expressed by council member Meghan Sahli-Wells about a private company creating a system that may compete with existing public transport agencies in Los Angeles. ""This is really seductive,"" said Ms Sahli-Wells. ""It looks super-sexy and super-easy, but it's half-baked from a public perspective."" As reported on the BBC last July the serial entrepreneur also tweeted his interest in building a Loop transport system on the East Coast. The difference between a Loop and a Hyperloop is that the latter requires a vacuum to be created within the tubes to eliminate air friction while the former does not. When asked for further details on the claims in his tweets, a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: ""The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials. ""With a few exceptions, feedback has been very positive and we have received verbal support from key government decision-makers for tunnelling plans, including a Hyperloop route from New York to Washington DC. ""We look forward to future conversations with the cities and states along this route and we expect to secure the formal approvals necessary to break ground later this year."" Last July, the company said that it was expecting to start digging by the end of 2017.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Manchester derby racist abuse claim: Man arrested,"Police said they received a report of a fan making alleged racist gestures in the game against Manchester City. City said they were working with police ""regarding an instance of objects being thrown on to the field of play"". A 41-year-old man has been held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order and remains in custody. On Saturday, a man was filmed apparently making monkey gestures and sounds towards Manchester United players during the derby at City's Etihad Stadium. It happened as United midfielder Fred went to take a corner in the second half and appeared to be hit by an object hurled from the crowd. After the match, the 26-year-old Brazilian said: ""On the field, I didn't see anything. I saw it only in the locker room afterwards. The guys showed me. [A man] even threw a lighter and it hit me."" United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: ""Fred and Jesse [Lingard] were in the corner, taking a corner, and I've seen the video, heard from the boys."" He said the apparent behaviour of the supporter caught on camera was ""unacceptable"". In a statement, Manchester City said they were working with police to identify offenders, adding: ""The club are also working with GMP regarding an instance of objects being thrown on to the field of play. ""The club operates a zero-tolerance policy regarding discrimination of any kind, and anyone found guilty of racial abuse will be banned from the club for life."" After social media speculation that the person allegedly making the monkey gestures worked for the infrastructure firm Kier Group, the company tweeted an employee had been suspended ""pending an investigation"". The company added: ""We're aware of a video circulating on social media. We take allegations and instances of racism very seriously and are currently investigating potential links between the individual involved and Kier. The FA said it would investigate the incident, while the Premier League said it ""will not tolerate discrimination in any form"". ""If people are found to have racially abused Premier League players they deserve to be punished and we will support any action taken by the authorities and the clubs,"" a Premier League spokesperson said. The incident comes a year after racism in football hit the headlines after City striker Raheem Sterling was subjected to racist abuse at Stamford Bridge, which led to a permanent ban for a Chelsea supporter. Sterling was also one of a number of England players who faced monkey chants and Nazi salutes in Euro 2020 qualifiers this year. Fred said the alleged incidents on Saturday showed ""we are still in a backward society"". United won the match 2-1 after goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Food bank charity gives record level of supplies,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education and family correspondent The annual figures from the Trussell Trust charity show a 13% increase, providing 1.3 million three-day food packages for ""people in crisis"". It warns the increase has been driven by those on benefits not being able to afford basic essentials. The Department for Work and Pensions says: ""The reasons why people use food banks are complex."" 'Daily struggle' But Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said the rising numbers relying on food banks showed that ""for too many people staying above water is a daily struggle"". The latest figures show that the level of food supplies provided by the trust has almost quadrupled in the past five years. In this year's total of 1.3 million emergency food supplies being delivered, 484,000 were requested for children, says the Trussell Trust, which represents about two-thirds of the food bank provision across the UK. The charity says the biggest rise has been among those on benefits, whose income has not kept pace with rising costs. Delays in the payment of benefits, including Universal Credit, was another ""significant factor"". The charity says debt is an increasing cause of demand for food banks, with people's incomes struggling to keep up with the cost of housing and utility bills. ""As a nation we expect no-one should be left hungry or destitute - illness, disability, family breakdown or the loss of a job could happen to any of us, and we owe it to each other to make sure sufficient financial support is in place when we need it most,"" said Ms Revie. The Trussell Trust chief executive said that it was vital that Universal Credit and the benefits system ""keep pace with the rising cost of essentials"". A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the rising number of food supplies given by the Trussell Trust was not driven by its introduction of Universal Credit. The DWP spokeswoman said the link to Universal Credit was ""based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample"" of Universal Credit claimants, ""whereas Universal Credit is working for the vast majority who claim it"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Diabetes life expectancy 'improving', study finds","A major study carried out by the university and the Scottish Diabetes Research Network showed that people with type 1 diabetes die significantly younger than the general population. Men with the condition live about 11 years less than those without it, while women live about 13 years less. However, previous research had reported a gap of between 15 and 27 years. Major advances have occurred in the treatment of type 1 diabetes over the last 30 years, and scientists said the life expectancy study could help future care plans and in the setting of insurance premiums. Diabetes is an incurable condition which leaves the body unable to control blood sugar levels, with type 1 causing the pancreas to stop producing insulin, a hormone which regulates the amount of glucose in blood. Diabetes charities such as Diabetes UK generally cite losses of life expectancy of between 15 and 20 years for type 1 patients, while estimates from the United States in the 1970s reported a loss of 27 years. However, the study run by Prof Helen Colhoun and Shona Livingstone at the university, shows contemporary life expectancy has improved. Life expectancy They studied the cases of more than 24,000 individuals with type 1 diabetes who were aged 20 or older between 2008 and 2010. They found that 47% of men and 55% of women with the condition survived to age 70, compared to 76% of men and 83% of women without it. On average, men with diabetes lived for 46.2 further years after turning 20, compared to 57.3 years for men without it. Average life expectancy for women with the condition from the age of 20 was an additional 48.1 years, compared to 61 years among women without it. The key culprit in the reduced life expectancy for diabetes patients was related to ischemic heart disease, while kidney disease was also an important contributor. Early detection The findings have been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Sarah Ward, deputy national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: ""This large study adds to our understanding of the serious impact of type 1 diabetes on length of life. ""The suggested increase in life expectancy is likely due to the improvements we have seen in diabetes care over the last 20 to 30 years, such as home blood glucose testing, earlier detection of diabetes and management of complications of the condition. ""While this report is encouraging, much more work remains to ensure better routine care for people with type 1 diabetes to enable them to manage their condition and live longer, healthier lives.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Arlene Foster 'lost friends' after attending Martin McGuinness funeral,"Sinn Féin's Mr McGuinness died in 2017 after suffering from a heart condition. Mrs Foster, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, was his partner in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government until a bitter row collapsed the executive in January that year. She received a round of applause when she entered the church for his funeral. The first minister appeared on The Late Late Show on Irish national broadcaster RTÉ on Friday night to mark the UK's exit from the EU and she told the programme she wanted to reassure people that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would continue to be neighbours. Although Mr McGuinness spent much of his political career serving in the Stormont executive as deputy first minister, in his earlier years he had been a senior commander within the Provisional IRA. Mrs Foster was asked if she found it difficult to attend his funeral, given his involvement in the Northern Ireland conflict, which came to be known as the Troubles. She said: ""I wasn't just going as Arlene Foster - I was going as the former first minister. ""It was absolutely the right thing to do - there were a lot of innocent victims who felt very strongly and I lost friends over going but I still believe it was the right thing to do."" She added that it was difficult because they were people she had known for a long time but she understood they took a different view than her. ""I took the view I had worked with him in government, served with him - as a leader you have things to do you would not do as an ordinary citizen and I had to do it,"" she said. Mrs Foster described it as ""encouraging"" that she received a round of applause when she entered the church for the funeral service. ""I was apprehensive going to the funeral because I didn't know what sort of a reception I was going to get,"" she said. ""The executive was down, we'd just had a very difficult election - it was very polarised - but I have to say I was welcomed very warmly.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Troubles pension: Criteria for ex-prisoners to receive settlements revealed,"By Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI Political Correspondent They are set out in the three-page ""confidential"" draft guidelines circulated to all the Stormont parties. The document also details the ""guiding principles"" the judge-led panel should use when assessing applications from those with a ""relevant conviction"". These are ""generally convictions carrying longer than 30 months"". They apply to the most ""serious crimes such as murder, actual bodily harm etc"", the paper states. Under the guidelines, an application can also be rejected if the president of the board decides the ""exceptional circumstances of the case having regard to material evidence"" makes payment inappropriate. That evidence includes Sinn Féin says the guidelines go beyond what is in the legislation and argues they discriminate against former prisoners who were injured during the Troubles. But the Northern Ireland Office disagrees and, along with the DUP, has accused Sinn Féin of blocking the pension payments by refusing to nominate the Justice Department to oversee the scheme. Applications for payments to victims of between £2,000 and £10,000 had been due to commence on 29 May. The draft guidelines also set out the following test which the panel must use when deciding if a former prisoner qualifies for a pension. ""Is the serious nature of the relevant conviction outweighed by mitigating circumstances and relevant factors""? The mitigating factors to be considered include: However, the draft guidelines also make it clear that ""where there is continuing disregard for the law as evidenced by recent convictions for offences other than minor ones, entitlement would be inappropriate"". The Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance have called for the payment scheme to be implemented immediately. Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson has called the current political stand-off ""shameful"". There is also gridlock over whether London or Stormont pays for the scheme which is estimated to cost much more than the £100m stated. Speaking on Sunday Politics, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh said Westminster should pay for the first year. She said: ""With everything else they are coping with at the moment in response to Covid and the economic recovery, I don't think it would be right or reasonable to ask Stormont to fund this in the first year ""The liability drops significantly after the first year to something like £5m a year, so I think those ongoing costs could be funded by Stormont. ""But in order to break the logjam and get this going, Westminster needs to step in and fund the scheme.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Snow: Norfolk has Covid mass vaccination centre and schools closed by Storm Darcy,"North Walsham Community Centre was shut, but other vaccination centres and doctors surgeries across the county remain open. A Met Office amber warning for snow was in place across much of the region - but it was scaled down to yellow at midday. Roads across the region were also said to be hazardous. NHS Cambridgeshire Community Services, which is in charge of the mass vaccination centres, confirmed the closure in North Walsham, but added that centres in the Norwich Castle Quarter, King's Lynn Corn Exchange, The Horsefair Shopping Centre in Wisbech and Connaught Hall in Attleborough all remained open. NHS Norfolk & Waveney Clinical Commissioning Group said all GP surgeries that were due to vaccinate were still open. Dr Luke Gardner, a GP at Park Surgery in Great Yarmouth, said: ""If you can't make it safely then please don't turn up. ""You don't need to call in. We will contact you after today. The vaccine will not go to waste."" Under current national restrictions, only children of critical workers, vulnerable children and young people have been attending school in person, but 386 schools were closed to all pupils on Monday, with others only partially open, according to the Norfolk County Council school closures webpage. Norfolk Police said in Norwich city centre the snow had been compacted, making driving hazardous especially on routes including Grapes Hill and Kett's Hill. BBC Radio Norfolk's Andrew Turner said roads across the county were ""covered in frozen and compacted snow, while pavements are knee deep"". The A47 had reopened, having closed earlier when two vehicles went into a snow drift, but road closures were still in place across other parts of the county. Elsewhere, there were delays at Long Stratton where the road has been reopened after having been blocked by a jack-knifed lorry. Another driver had to be dug out of his car after it got trapped in a snowdrift at 05:45 GMT. Victoria Lawrence said her husband Steve had been driving through Southrepps to pick up his father for a hospital appointment. ""He got stuck and it just drifted over the car,"" she said.

King's Lynn incinerator: Alternative technology considered,"The plan offers an option on the Saddlebow waste incinerator proposed by Norfolk County Council (NCC). West Norfolk Borough Council leader Nick Daubney said it was important to ""embrace new opportunities"" in waste management. NCC said the plans were an attempt to ""disrupt"" the Saddlebow scheme. The borough council has been in talks with Material Works, a consortium that can process waste materials which currently goes to landfill. The waste is processed into granules of an inert plastic-like substance which can be turned into products including fence panels, pallets and tiles. Mr Daubney said: ""Technology regarding waste is moving at a very fast pace. ""That's why it's important we don't make high cost, long-term commitments with out-dated technology and embrace new opportunities. ""As a local authority I believe we are the first people to have a go at this."" Create 300 jobs Bill Borrett, cabinet member for environment and waste, who is steering the county council incinerator project, said: ""I think the borough council is being premature in saying they've found a solution for black bag waste in west Norfolk."" ""Our view is that the nature and timing of today's announcement is principally a rather cynical last minute attempt to disrupt the Saddlebow planning process. ""As the waste disposal authority for Norfolk we have repeatedly asked the borough council for details of their proposals, but have heard nothing until contacted by journalists today."" Material Works have said their recycling process would cost taxpayers almost half that of disposing waste to landfill and had the potential to create 300 jobs. ""The cost per tonne of landfill currently stands at £92, whereas our process is just £55, which will bring savings of over £1.3m per year to council tax payers in the borough,"" said a spokesman. Since its inception, campaigners have aired concerns over health and whether the proposed £500m plant at Saddlebow would offer the best solution to the county's waste problems. The county council's planning sub-committee is due to consider the planning application in the summer. A decision to approve contract negotiations with Material Work will be taken by West Norfolk Borough Councillors on Tuesday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Samsung apologises to sick factory workers,"In the apology, Samsung president Kim Ki-nam said staff and families had ""suffered"" because the South Korean company had been too slow to act. Earlier this month Samsung agreed a compensation deal for workers who fell ill while on its production lines. The apology follows a campaign to win redress for staff by Hwang Sang-ki, the father of one Samsung worker who died. Cash payout ""Beloved colleagues and families have suffered for a long time, but Samsung Electronics failed to take care of the matter earlier,"" said Mr Kim, adding that the company had ""lacked being considerate"". He said Samsung Electronics had not ""fully and completely"" handled potential health risks on production lines that make chips and LCD displays. ""Today, we wish to express a sincere apology to the workers who suffered from diseases, as well as their families,"" Mr Kim said. Mr Hwang Sang-ki, who headed the compensation campaign, said the apology did not go far enough. ""Honestly, today's apology made by a Samsung Electronics CEO is not sufficient for the victims of the work-related diseases,"" he told the Yonhap news agency. However, he said, he would ""consider"" it as resolution of the issue. Mr Hwang began the compensation campaign in 2007 after his daughter, Hwang Yumi. died on the way to hospital after developing leukaemia. He sought to shame the company into making payouts to workers who suffered the same disease or who contracted other illnesses after working for the company. He set up the Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (Sharps) with the help of labour activists. The group held protests and sit-ins to put pressure on Samsung to act. Sharps said it had found 319 other victims, 117 of whom had died, as of June this year. The compensation package agreed this month will see sick workers - and their children with related illnesses - get up to 150m won (£103,207) per illness. All current or former staff who worked for Samsung and its sub-contractors on the chip and display lines in the Giheung factory in South Korea since 1984 can apply for compensation. The agreement does not acknowledge that Samsung workplaces are directly related to the diseases suffered by some employees.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Spatial Framework: Housing plan undergoing 'radical rewrite',"The next public consultation in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) scheme was due in September but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor Andy Burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced ""in due course"", the mayor's office said. The GMSF scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last October to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to ""radically re-write"" the plans, calling them ""unfair and disproportionate"". The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was ""disappointing"". He said: ""It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this September deadline. ""We now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours."" Matthew Good, a spokesman for the House Builder's Federation said: ""It's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. ""Councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. ""Without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that."" A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the mayor had appointed Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett to lead a ""radical"" rewrite of the plans. He added: ""This re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Maghera firm makes chair for Pope Francis,"The Specialist Joinery Group was commissioned to make the altar furniture to be used at the papal mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park next Sunday. Company chairman John Bosco O'Hagan said it had been ""a privilege and an honour"" to do the work. The County Londonderry firm was offered the task after making an icon for the World Meeting of Families. Pope Francis will make a speech at the World Meeting in Croke Park on the first day of his visit to Dublin. Mr O'Hagan said the icon has travelled 45,000 miles between parishes the length and breadth of Ireland for the past year. Great honour The company was approached by the Church six months ago with a view to supplying the sanctuary furniture for the papal mass. ""We looked at the drawings and I said immediately it would be a great honour and a privilege to be asked to do this,"" Mr O'Hagan said. The furniture includes the altar the Pope will say mass on, the chair he will sit in and the lectern he will speak from. ""Everything is to be quite simple. It is all straight lines and a simple manufacture,"" said Mr O'Hagan, speaking on BBC News NI's programme Good Morning Ulster. ""There is nothing elaborate about the whole thing. The Pope is a simple man and he seems to live a very simple life, so the furniture is simple as well."" 'I'll be in the background' More than 300 family and friends attended an event at the company's premises in Maghera on Friday to view the pieces before they are transported to Dublin. The company said the furniture is expected to go on permanent display somewhere in Ireland or Rome after the mass. ""The Specialist family are incredibly proud of the sanctuary furniture and this is without doubt the most important project that we will do in our lifetime,"" Mr O'Hagan said. Mr O'Hagan said that he will be attending the Pope's visit at the weekend to see his product in action. ""I will be there, but I will be very humble in the background, keeping quiet,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The rocket that eats itself,"By Ken MacdonaldBBC Scotland Science Correspondent It will lift satellites into orbit by burning its own body as fuel. Rocketry is a wasteful business. A rocket uses most of its energy lifting its own weight into space. Its payload is typically just a fraction of that. A team from the University of Glasgow and Oles Honchar Dnipro National University in Ukraine have created a rocket engine to change that. It burns a solid propellant rod that doubles as the rocket body itself. A rigid tube of polyethylene fuel encloses a core of powdered oxidiser. This ""propellant rod"" is forced into the rocket engine where the two components are separated, vaporised, mixed and burned to create thrust. Writing in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, the team call it an ""autophage"" rocket, meaning it is something that eats itself. Typically a solid-fuelled rocket behaves much like a firework: once the blue touch paper has (metaphorically) been lit you have little option but to stand clear and watch it go. The new design adds a significant feature. By varying the speed at which the fuel rod is forced into the engine, the thrust can be varied as in a liquid-fuelled rocket. Being able to throttle a rocket means its thrust can be reduced when reaching ""max Q"" - the spell of maximum aerodynamic pressure when rising through the atmosphere - and throttled back up again as the air thins. Throttling thrust also means a payload can be more precisely placed in orbit. Cheaper option Dr Patrick Harkness, senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow's school of engineering, says the design means the rocket will get shorter as it climbs higher: ""During the ascent the engine will work its way up along the body of the rocket, consuming [it]. ""So by the end of the flight, only the payload and the empty engine enter space. ""That means we put less debris up there."" It would also be cheaper than existing rockets and, because the design can be scaled down for smaller payloads, it would be ideal for lifting small satellites of the kind which are already being built in Scotland in their dozens. Currently these Cubesats have to wait to travel into space as passengers on the launches of large rockets like the Russian Soyuz. A rocket dedicated to a single satellite would mean it could go straight to its intended orbit. The new design works. The engine is already turning a propellant rod into thrust in a laboratory in Ukraine. An application is being made for EU funding to take it from there towards the launch pad. Given that several sites in Scotland are competing to become a spaceport, it could be coming to a launch pad near you.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Footballer’s rare cancer tumour ‘size of a tennis ball’,"Nathan Trueman, 21, was diagnosed with a rare synovial sarcoma cancer in December 2020. The first team captain of Portishead Town Football Club discovered a 10cm tumour - about the size of a tennis ball - under his right arm. He is undergoing four rounds of chemotherapy and five weeks of radiotherapy ahead of an operation. 'Don't be afraid' A recent MRI scan has revealed the tumour has stopped growing and he is due to have an operation in a few month's time. Mr Trueman said: ""I've always been healthy, played football since I was young and would go to the gym five times a week. It can happen to anyone. ""My message to anyone would be don't be afraid, call the doctor if there's something wrong, I've seen how weeks and months can make a difference and make cancer 100 times harder to treat. ""The doctors said the tumour was the size of a tennis ball, I can't wait for it to be removed so I can look forward to playing football again."" Mr Trueman's friends, family and teammates as well as businesses in Portishead in Somerset have been taking on a series of fundraising challenges hoping to raise £50,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust and for Sarcoma UK. 'So proud' Mr Trueman, who played with Bristol Rovers as a youth and for Forest Green Rovers under 18s, said: ""It's amazing, it's so inspiring to realise how much support you have, I'm very grateful. ""Football has been a massive part of it as I have met so many people through playing.""

#unfairandlovely: A new social campaign celebrates dark skin,"By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi In matrimonial advertisements in South Asian countries, women with ""fair complexion"" are in high demand, and millions of men and women around the world have resorted to bleaching their skin. In recent years, new creams have been introduced to lighten armpit hair and even female genitals. And their manufacturers advertise their wares by preying on basic human insecurities - consumers are encouraged to believe that lightening their skin tone a shade or two will enable them to win 'better' jobs and spouses and generally improve the quality of their lives. Over the years, campaigners have tried to challenge this belief - they argue that beauty is more than skin deep and that dark is beautiful too. In recent weeks, three students from the University of Texas, Austin, have launched a new campaign which has become a talking point on social media around the world. It was inspired by a project that Pax Jones, a 21-year-old black student at the University of Texas in Austin, began in December. She created a photo series featuring stunning images of her South Asian classmates, sisters Mirusha and Yanusha Yogarajah. ""Our goal was to combat colourism and the under-representation of people of colour in the media. We were trying to challenge the way colourism permeates our lives,"" Ms Jones told the BBC over the phone from Austin. The series, called ""Unfair & Lovely"", became a hit and inspired the hashtag #unfairandlovely - named after the hugely popular Indian skin-lightening cream Fair and Lovely. The campaign, which asked dark-skinned people to put their photos on social media, generated lively discussions on Twitter and Facebook and saw nearly 1,000 people posting their photos on Instagram. Mirusha Yogarajah told the BBC she readily agreed to be a part of the campaign because colourism is rampant within the South Asian community. ""Most of us are advised not to go out in the sun because we'll get darker. It's as if darkness is undesirable. ""In college, I was abused by a South Asian person who had lighter skin. And someone once threw a bleach balloon at me."" Such incidents, Ms Yogarajah says, are deeply humiliating. ""At the time they happened, it was really hard for me to see myself as valuable. It is difficult to understand why people will dehumanise you for the way you look. I felt very vulnerable,"" she says. Ms Jones, who says she has been ridiculed for her ""hair texture"" and ""wide nose"", agreed. ""We wanted to start a conversation and I think we have succeeded in that"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wrexham's Supporters Trust backs rival takeover bid,"Club owners say their preferred bid is a community-based venture, led by local hotel entrepreneur Stephanie Booth. To cheers, Ms Booth read out the club statement to fans before Wrexham's 2-1 win over Forest Green on Saturday. Wrexham council says it will continue to facilitate talks between all sides, but will not put in any money. Terry Heath, who is on the board of WST, said there was no bitterness despite Ms Booth's bid being accepted in principle. ""We are talking about the future of Wrexham Football Club. We will work with whoever we need to to ensure that happens, he said. ""We are quite happy to take a little step back and see what happens but we are there to speak to her and willing to work."" Wrexham council leader, councillor Aled Roberts, said the authority had been working behind the scenes for almost two years to assure the club's future. ""We need to get to a position where we have a stable organisation running Wrexham FC,"" he said. ""Once we have a stable organisation and the redevelopment of the stadium is assured, the council and other bodies would need to work with the organisation regarding that redevelopment. ""To be fair, we have been involved in discussions for 18 months to two years but because of the uncertainty, we have never got to a stage where a specific design or project and, more importantly, costed plans were available for organisations to consider."" He said it is ""not the role of the local authority to put money into a football club"". However, other stadiums have received public funding and so, on that basis, the authority ""will look to project manage the arrangement, and we are in touch with a number of governing bodies regarding the finances that can be put in"". 'Community-owned asset' ""The club is not in immediate threat but we know that time is short and we will continue to facilitate those discussions,"" he said. On Saturday, Ms Booth said: ""I don't know whether I've taken the poison chalice and I know I can go from hero to zero overnight so it's risky in terms of reputation. ""But what it means is that we can save the club and the stadium and I will make sure it never goes into administration. ""I will also make sure it is a community-owned asset for the community with an ever-enduring lease for the football club. ""I'm going to bully Wrexham County Borough Council and the Welsh Assembly Government. ""I'm going to put pressure on them to help us save Wrexham, and they need to buy into this because it needs to be owned by the community,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US Supreme Court hears case of Mexican teen slain by border patrol,"Agent Jesus Mesa was on the US side when he fatally shot Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, 15, across the Mexican border in June 2010. Agent Mesa was not prosecuted or extradited to face criminal charges. The case could determine the scope of US law and whether non-citizens are protected by American courts. During oral arguments on Tuesday, the eight US judges appeared evenly divided, with the conservative-leaning jurists saying that the fact that the teenager's death occurred in Mexico should be reason enough to keep the case out of US courts. But the court's liberal judges indicated they may support the parents' ability to sue based on the death occurring in an area where both the US and Mexico share legal responsibilities. Agent Mesa was on a bicycle patrol between El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, when he shot and killed the Mexican boy. Sergio was among a group at a cement culvert by an 18ft (5.4 metres) high border fence when Agent Mesa tried to apprehend them. The officer caught one of the boys while two others on the Mexican side ran and hid behind a pillar. The teenager's family said he was just playing with friends. But the Justice Department said the officer was trying to stop ""smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing"". Agent Mesa said in court documents that he opened fire after rocks were thrown at him from across the border, including by Sergio. Mobile phone footage showed that Sergio was struck as he peeked out from behind a pillar, according to the petitioner's brief. US officials decided against prosecuting Agent Mesa, arguing the Justice Department lacked jurisdiction on the Mexican side of the border. Though Mexican officials charged Agent Mesa with murder, the Obama administration refused to extradite him. The teenager's parents sued Agent Mesa for damages, but lower courts dismissed the lawsuit. The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October. The case comes in the wake President Donald Trump's order for the ""immediate construction"" of a border wall and the hiring of an additional 5,000 border patrol agents. Read more The teenager's death is not the only border case facing legal challenges. The parents of a teen killed in Nogales, Mexico, by a US agent across the border have filed a civil rights lawsuit, which is pending until the Supreme Court issues a ruling. Prosecutors are pursuing second-degree murder charges against Agent Lonnie Swartz in the death of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez. A 2013 report, commissioned by US Customs and Border Protection and written by an independent group, found that the agency failed to sufficiently investigate 67 border shootings between 2010-12. The report also questioned the use of force in some of those cases. The agency has said it has since changed it policies, including response to reports of rock-throwing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Northampton Town loan firm received £900k in VAT repayments,"By Matt PreceyBBC Look East 1st Land Ltd, set up to redevelop Northampton Town's Sixfields stadium, had been passed £7.25m of a £10.25m loan from Northampton Borough Council. The redevelopment remains unfinished and 1st Land is in liquidation. Owner Howard Grossman said the VAT repayments were ""all legitimate"". Mr Grossman did not elaborate on how 1st Land qualified for the repayments, but said they were all ""in accordance with HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) rules"". Northampton Town was lent the money in 2013 and 2014 and the initial plan was to refurbish parts of Sixfields and land adjacent to the ground - including a new stand, hotel and conference centre. None of the work was completed and a criminal inquiry is under way into ""alleged financial irregularities"" surrounding the loan. Subsequently, the VAT repayments to 1st Land Ltd have emerged. Unpaid invoices When a firm has charged customers less VAT than the tax paid out on purchases of goods or services, HMRC will repay the difference. Bank account statements seen by the BBC show 1st Land received six VAT repayments from HMRC worth £943,579 in the 15 months before it went into administration in January 2015. However, a list of supplier payments made by 1st Land that year and in 2013, which were also obtained by the BBC, indicates expenditure totalling £2.3m. Among those payments were two invoices totalling almost £69,000 submitted by the main contractor on the stadium project, Buckingham Group, in 2014, however the VAT components of these invoices weren't paid. Three other invoices submitted by Buckingham Group in August and September that year, totalling £1.75m including VAT, remain wholly unpaid. According to Monty Jivraj, a tax expert at Neumans LLP, HMRC would have looked at 1st Land's paperwork prior to making the repayments. ""If a company was to file a VAT repayment claim of, let's say £900,000 or £1m, HMRC would have a legal obligation to send VAT compliance officers to check the documents, such as invoices, VAT accounts and bank statements to check whether the company is legally entitled,"" he said. HMRC said it could not comment about the affairs of individual companies. Last week, Northampton Borough Council apologised after an audit report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) identified a string of failures surrounding the way the loan was approved. Loans and repayments Amount of Northampton Borough Council loan to Northampton Town FC forwarded to 1st Land Ltd (Dec 2013-July 2014): £7.25m HMRC VAT repayments to 1st Land Ltd (Feb-Sept 2014): £943,579 Amount remaining in 1st Land's bank accounts, Jan 2015: Barclays -£1,019; Lloyds £41.15 Amount owed to biggest creditor, Buckingham Group Contracting: £2.07m",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Theresa May's 'honeymoon period' boosts Tory polling,"It suggests general election support of 29% (up 6 from July), with Labour on 35% (+1), Plaid Cymru 13% (-3), UKIP 14% (-2) and the Lib Dems 7% (-1). The YouGov poll for ITV Cymru Wales and Cardiff University is the first Welsh poll since Theresa May became PM. Analyst Prof Roger Scully said the result reflected her ""honeymoon period"" as a new party leader. Projecting the findings uniformly across the current Westminster constituency boundaries, Prof Scully, from Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, said the only change would be for Labour to lose Ynys Mon to Plaid Cymru. This would give Labour 24 out of the 40 Welsh seats, the Conservatives 11, Plaid Cymru four and the Liberal Democrats one. But a new Parliamentary map proposed by the Boundary Commission would cut the number of Welsh MPs by more than a quarter to 29. In a general election fought under those arrangements, Prof Scully's seat projections would see Labour only narrowly winning the majority of Welsh seats. He said Labour would emerge with 15 MPs, the Conservatives 10, Plaid Cymru three and the Liberal Democrats one, based on the poll. The opinion poll's findings for assembly election voting follow a similar pattern. Prof Scully's projections indicate Labour losing three seats, giving it 26 AMs, and the Conservatives gaining three to again become the biggest opposition party in Cardiff Bay, with a 14-strong group. The projections give the other parties the same number of AMs as they achieved in May's assembly election - Plaid 12, UKIP seven and the Liberal Democrats one. Prof Scully said the ""significant lift"" in Tory fortunes suggested by the poll ""confirms that the broad picture indicated in recent Britain-wide polls applies in full to Wales as well"". ""It is not at all unusual for new prime ministers, or leaders of major parties to enjoy something of a honeymoon period,"" he said. ""In our September Welsh Political Barometer Poll last year, the recent leadership victory of Jeremy Corbyn appeared to give his party an immediate boost in the polls. ""The 'Corbyn Bounce' was very short-lived: by the time of the next poll, in December, it had already disappeared."" The poll, for ITV Cymru Wales and Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre, had a sample of 1,001 adults and was carried out online by YouGov from 18-21 September 2016.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh Government to implement ban on microbeads,"The Welsh Government will launch a consultation later this year on how it will be enforced. Environmentalists are concerned microbeads are building up in oceans and could be entering the food chain. The small pieces of plastic have been used in toothpaste, body scrubs and other products. It is yet not clear when the measure would come into force in Wales, with the implementation date to be included in the consultation. The UK government has said the ban will come into effect in England at the start of 2018. There is only one company in Wales thought to be manufacturing cosmetic products containing microbeads and it is believed to be phasing them out. Although the UK government has backed a prohibition on the substances, the devolved administrations have to pass their own legislation for it to work in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Local authorities' trading standards departments are expected to be responsible for enforcing the measure. The Welsh Government said Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths had agreed to implement the ban on the manufacture and sale of cosmetics and personal care products containing plastic microbeads in Wales. Welsh ministers had earlier taken part in a joint exercise with the UK government and the other devolved administrations seeking views on a proposed ban. Chris Flower, director general of Cosmetic Toiletry & Perfumery Association, argued it was ""important that any ban on plastic microbeads is based on clear and robust scientific evidence of risk of harm to the marine environment"". He said that since 2015 the cosmetics industry had been voluntarily removing plastic microbeads from rinse-off cleansing and exfoliating personal care products. Laura Foster, of the Marine Conservation Society, called for consistency across the UK in how the ban is implemented, adding: ""We want to see the devolved administration come out with clear mechanisms with how they ensure compliance with the ban."" 'Necessary preparations' Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said: ""A ban on the manufacture and sale of cosmetics containing plastic microbeads would help cut down on plastics in our seas and our shorelines."" Welcoming the two governments cooperation on the policy, Conservative environment spokesman David Melding said ""protecting our seas from plastic pollution should be a top priority"". A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Through our consultation, we want to gain the views of all interested parties, make sure all manufacturers in Wales are aware of the ban well in advance and they have sufficient time to make the necessary preparations."" The ban would not require a full bill to be passed in the assembly, but would be implemented through secondary legislation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Porthmadog bypass section opens early for Cob festival,"The Cob 200 festival marks the 200th anniversary of Porthmadog's Cob, a causeway built by William Madocks. Traffic will be allowed to use a partially completed section of the £34.4m Porthmadog bypass leaving the square in Tremadog clear for events. It is not yet clear whether the road will remain open after the festival. A series of events are being held this month in a tribute to the causeway and to Maddocks, who also built the village of Tremadog, complete with church, chapel, factory and houses. He used the ""great embankment"" - or Cob as it is now known - to reclaim hundreds of acres of land from the sea and, in turn, brought prosperity to the area, linking the slate quarries with the sea. The Tremadog 200 Celebrations this weekend form part of Cob 200 and sees the square and Church Street traffic-free for 24-hours on Saturday with stalls, street entertainers, traditional fairground activities. People are being asked to dress in period costume. The Beddgelert to Penmorfa A498 road will remain open with public transport being re-directed. A Welsh Government spokesman said through-traffic would be allowed to use the bypass between the Tremadog and Bodawen roundabouts, ahead of its completion by the end of the year. He added: ""Due to ongoing routine works relating to the completion of the bypass, we are unable to confirm at this stage whether or not the aforementioned section of road will remain open after the festivities."" Madocks was born into a wealthy London family in 1773. But he also had strong links with north Wales, the son of gentry from the old county of Denbighshire. He bought an estate near Traeth Mawr in 1798 and set about reclaiming several hundred acres of farm land, building the embankment across the estuary of the River Glaslyn, producing a natural harbour. The Cob was officially opened on 17 September, 1811 and a big celebration is being held in Porthmadog to mark the bicentenary next Saturday. The Tremadog 200 Celebrations end on Sunday with a service in St Mary's Church at 18:00 BST. Special events are also being held at Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways in Porthmadog, created in 1832 to link the quarries with the harbour via the Cob.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Lamentable' defence spending decisions attacked by MPs,"The Public Accounts Committee said it was ""extremely frustrated"" that the MoD had still not made the hard choices needed to plug a £13bn funding gap. The warning comes ahead of a government review which is expected to overhaul defence procurement. The MoD said it was committed to securing the best equipment. In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee - which examines public spending - expressed ""extreme"" frustration that ""we see the same problems year after year"". The MPs accused the MoD of failing to make the ""hard choices"" necessary to plug a gap of up to £13bn pounds in the current equipment programme. ""The government has still not taken the strategic decisions required to establish an affordable equipment plan and deliver the crucial military capabilities needed by our armed forces. ""The department's lamentable failure to get a grip on the equipment plan continues, despite this committee and the NAO [National Audit Office] consistently highlighting serious affordability issues in the plan year after year."" Committee chair Meg Hillier said: ""The MoD knows what it's getting wrong. We know what it's getting wrong. ""For years, we have made concrete proposals to improve delivery of key strategic priorities and here we are again, with the same gaps in our national defence and the same risk to our armed forces personnel, year after year."" Conservative MP Mark Francois recently warned General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, that he should ""nip back to the department and ask them to sort their bloody selves out, because if not, Cummings is going to come down there and sort you out his own way, and you won't like it."" The prime minister's chief advisor, Dominic Cummings has been a harsh critic of defence procurement in the past. The government has said its new integrated defence and security review - due to be completed next year - would seek ""innovative ways"" to promote UK interests while committing to spending targets. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""As the committee acknowledges, managing complex defence programmes can be challenging and we continue to reduce the gap between our budget and predicted costs, achieving £7.8 billion of efficiency savings last year and securing an extra £2.2 billion for defence.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jeremy Corbyn: Children's talents being squandered,"Speaking at a party event in Brighton, he pledged to create a social justice commission to help tackle inequality. Mr Corbyn added it was ""not right"" that some primary schools in England were having to stage events to raise money. The education secretary rejected the claim that social mobility was currently focused on the ""lucky few"". The Social Mobility Commission is an independent body that promotes social mobility in England, as well as highlighting the situation across Britain. Under Labour's proposals, it would be replaced by a new body with extensive statutory powers and independence. A minister for social justice would be based in the Treasury and work across all government departments to address inequality. Asked how the work of a justice commission would differ from the social mobility commission, Mr Corbyn said: ""The approach is social justice for all rather than the ability of a very small number to achieve a higher position in society."" He added: ""The idea of social mobility where you pluck somebody out of poverty and promote them into a private school education or promote them somewhere else doesn't actually help the majority."" Mr Corbyn said ""some of the wisest people you meet are actually those that are driving buses, sweeping our streets or working in factories or shops"", adding: ""So much talent in our society is absolutely squandered and wasted because of obscene levels of poverty and inequality in Britain."" Labour has said it wants to create a national education service and increase funding. Mr Corbyn said: ""It's simply not right that our children should be sent on sponsored walks and sponsored runs and all the rest of it to raise money for basic equipment in schools that should be provided by the public purse in the first place."" Education Secretary Damian Hinds said Labour's proposals would ""downgrade the importance of social mobility"". He said: ""There is not a conflict between fairness and social mobility - one requires the other... it is about breaking the cycle of disadvantage and making sure that everyone has the opportunity to fulfil their potential. ""Our education system is doing exactly that with the gap between disadvantaged children and those from a privileged background having narrowed at every stage: pre-school, primary, at GCSE and with more disadvantaged young people going to university than ever before.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

George Bell: Former wartime bishop 'abused girl in cathedral',"The woman said she wanted to speak out about his ""awful"" treatment of her after several high-profile figures defended the bishop, who died in 1958. ""He might have been a hero, but heroes don't always do good things,"" she said. The Church has settled a civil claim in connection with the allegations and has formally apologised to her. The woman said the Rt Rev George Bell began abusing her when she was five as a relative, who was a church employee, took her to Chichester cathedral. 'Not natural' ""It started off with him wriggling about with me on his lap. He read the story and then gradually it got more personal, he started to touch me,"" she added. ""When I was getting to about nine you realise these things aren't quite natural. Luckily enough my father moved away and we all went with him."" She said the abuse had affected her relationships and may have led to periods of depression. ""He was awful to me. I can't say he ruined my life but he didn't make it easy."" The woman's allegations were first made in 1995 but not investigated or referred to the police. In October, the current Bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner, issued a formal apology after a civil claim was settled. The diocese said investigations found ""no reason to doubt the veracity of the claim"". 'Not proven facts' Journalist Peter Hitchens has criticised the way the case has been handled, saying the church should have taken more care because the bishop's ""reputation is so important"". ""I have always been concerned about the church's decision to publicise these allegations as if they were proven facts, which they are not. ""They may be true but they should be treated as allegations,"" he added. The Bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, lead bishop on safeguarding, said the decision to settle the case was taken on the ""balance of probabilities"" and the overriding goal was to ""search out the truth"" regardless of its impact. Bishop George Bell was well known for championing the people of Germany during World War Two and made a speech in the House of Lords in February 1944 opposing Churchill's policy of saturation bombing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

His role will ensure veterans ""don't just have a strong voice, but can also avail of the support that their service merits"", he said. He will also work, he added, to ensure ""promises made to them in the Armed Forces Covenant are fulfilled"". It is estimated there are about 150,000 ex-military personnel in Northern Ireland. ""We should be proud of them and recognise their skills and the sacrifices they and their families have made,"" Mr Kinahan said. ""We should welcome them back into society when they retire, ensure they are not forgotten and are not put at any disadvantage. ""When they need help, it should be there for them immediately,"" he said. As commissioner, his role ""is to ensure that this is the case and that coordinated and effective delivery exists for all those who have served,"" he added.

Lyft valued at $24bn ahead of share market debut,"That makes it the largest company to go public since China's Alibaba in 2014. Lyft's shares will start trading on the tech-dominated Nasdaq index on Friday. The flotation values the combined stake of founders Logan Green and John Zimmer at $1bn. Drivers will be given $1,000, to be taken as cash or shares. Lyft's main rival, Uber, is expected to sell its shares publicly this year. Technology-based firms Pinterest, Slack, and Postmates, are also scheduled to make their market debuts this year. Earlier in the week, Lyft increased the indicative price range for its share offer to $70-$72 a share, up from $62-$68 previously. Analysis: By Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent Lyft's stock sale is a big moment for the tech industry. Shares in the ride-hailing company were priced at $72 a piece. This was at the high end of expectations. It suggests a strong appetite from investors ahead of the company's first day of trading as a public company. For a firm that is not yet profitable, it provides validation of its business model, one that has established it as the number two player in the US. Wall Street is clearly eager to take part in the massive growth in the ride-sharing industry. That bodes well for Lyft's rival, Uber, which looks set to make its debut soon on the New York Stock Exchange. But there are risks, including regulatory uncertainty as well as the fierce competition likely to emerge as the autonomous vehicle market develops. And given its dual-class share structure (Lyft is keeping voting control), investors are buying a little piece of a company in which they will have almost no say. Lyft was launched in 2012 by technology entrepreneurs Mr Zimmer and Mr Green, three years after Uber was founded. It remains the smaller company, with a limited international presence. Uber is expected to be valued at about $120bn when it goes public. However, Lyft's profile has risen over the last few years, as its larger rival has been hit by controversy surrounding its aggressive corporate culture and data collection practices. Lyft now accounts for about 39% of the ride-share market in the US, up from about 22% in 2016, the company says. Its revenues doubled in 2018 to reach $2.2bn, compared with $1.1bn in 2017, according to its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, its losses also increased. The company lost $911m in 2018, up from $688m in 2017. Gervais Williams, senior executive director at investment group Miton, told the BBC's Today programme that 30 years ago only about one-fifth of companies floating on the market were unprofitable, but now it is about four-fifths. He said it showed that investors wanted to be involved in companies that are building market share, but he worries ""they don't have sustainability"" and investors' attitudes could change quite quickly if there is a downturn.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Further rise in NHS Scotland consultant vacancies,"The NHS Scotland workforce report shows there are 422 unfilled posts across the country. More than half of those have remained vacant for more than six months. Health Secretary Shona Robison said NHS Scotland's workforce had increased to ""historically high levels"" under the current government. The specialism with the highest numbers of vacancies is radiology, where 80% of vacancies have now been unfilled for more than half a year. The difficulty of attracting specialist staff to rural areas is also reflected. In NHS Dumfries and Galloway all vacant consultant posts have been unfilled for more than six months. Doctors' unions have warned of the additional pressure the vacancies put on staff in an already stretched service. 'Unprecedented levels' Simon Barker, the chairman of BMA Scotland's consultants committee, said: ""The lack of substantive progress that is being made in filling these vacancies and ensuring that Scotland's NHS has the staff it needs is increasingly concerning. ""Every post in the NHS that lies empty makes it more difficult to deliver high quality care to patients and adds to the pressure facing staff left covering the gap created by the vacancy. ""Demands on the NHS are already at unprecedented levels and the struggles it is facing are only made worse by not having the medical staff in place that the NHS knows is required."" Dr Grant Baxter, from the Royal College of Radiologists, said the figures highlighted the ""desperate situation"" in clinical radiology. ""Chronic under-investment in the specialty over many years, coupled with increasing demand for life-saving scans and interventional radiology techniques, are putting Scotland's radiologist doctors under immense strain. ""If the situation continues unaddressed our health service will collapse, patients will suffer and the much-lauded government ambition to improve cancer outcomes in Scotland will never be achieved and may potentially worsen."" Agency staff Ms Robison said NHS Scotland's workforce had increased by more than 10% under the current government and by almost 500 in the past year. ""To help meet the demands the NHS faces we're putting record investment into our health service and legislating to ensure we have the right staff with the right skills in the right place,"" she said. ""Spending on agency staff fell by 7% over the last year and we have been clear with boards that they should only use an agency as a last resort when temporary staff are required."" Ms Robison added that NHS Improvement reported last week that nursing vacancies stood at 10.2% in England, compared with 4.5% in Scotland.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump defends Fox host Bill O'Reilly amid sex claims,"""I think he's a person I know well - he is a good person,"" Mr Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday from the White House, surrounded by his aides. ""I think he shouldn't have settled; personally I think he shouldn't have settled,"" the president added. Dozens of advertisers have pulled commercials from The O'Reilly Factor. ""I don't think Bill did anything wrong,"" Mr Trump told the New York Times, adding that ""he should have taken it all the way"" to court. The New York Times reported on Saturday that settlements of $13m (£10.4m) were reached with five women who accused Mr O'Reilly of inappropriate behaviour. Since then, about 26 firms - including Mercedes Benz, BMW and Advil - have withdrawn advertisements from Mr O'Reilly's show. The scandal poses a problem for Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News because The O'Reilly Factor is the cable network's most popular show, with four million viewers a night. Mr O'Reilly - who is reportedly paid $18m (£14m) a year - has so far remained silent about the allegations on his nightly programme this week. In 2004 when he was accused by a Fox News producer of making sexually suggestive phone calls, he took to the airwaves to defend himself. He called the case ""the single most evil thing I have ever experienced, and I've seen a lot"". On Tuesday night, an advert for Coldwell Banker ran, but the real estate company tweeted afterwards: ""We were disappointed that our ad ran on O'Reilly as it wasn't part of our intentional media programming. We pulled future ads from the show."" The other companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Hyundai, Constant Contact, UNTUCKit, Sanofi, Allstate, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition/Rachael Ray Nutrish, T. Rowe Price, Mitsubishi, Wayfair, MileIQ, Lexus, Bayer, Esurance, Credit Karma, True Car, The Wonderful Company, Society of Human Resources Management, Suburu, and Orkin. In June 2016, Mr Trump defended then-Fox News chairman Roger Ailes when he faced allegations of sexual assault at the cable network. ""I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining,"" said Mr O'Reilly, ""I know how much he's helped them. ""And now all of a sudden they're saying these horrible things about him."" Mr Ailes later left Fox over the claims. Earlier this month, President Trump signed a presidential proclamation declaring April to be National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. During last year's election campaign, Mr Trump apologised after a 2005 video emerged of him making obscene boasts about groping women.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Newtownabbey murder: police investigate drugs links,"Danny McKay, 36, was shot dead at his home in Longlands on the outskirts of north Belfast at 20:30 BST on Thursday. DCI John McVea said it was a ""brutal and ruthless attack"". ""He was known to police, but not particularly well known. Whatever Daniel may have done in his life, nothing merits this,"" he said. Mr McKay, the father of a 10-year-old child, was shot several times as he sat alone on a sofa in his living room. He died at the scene. At least two armed men were involved in the attack. DCI McVea said: ""We are keeping an open mind as to who was involved and would appeal to anyone who knows which group or individuals were involved to contact detectives."" Police are investigating a link to a silver Volkswagen Bora which had been stolen by five masked men in the New Lodge area shortly before the shooting and was later found burnt out in Ardmoulin Place, west Belfast. Sinn Fein Newtownabbey Councillor Gerry O'Reilly said there was ""shock and anger"" in the area at the murder. He said there was speculation among residents that dissident republicans were responsible for the attack which, he said, happened in the man's home. ""He is a local man, the man has lived there all his life,"" he added. 'Appalling and brutal' Mr O'Reilly said children were playing in the street outside at the time of the shooting and people were at shops ""within yards"" of the incident. He said the killers needed ""to be taken off our streets to prevent this happening again"". ""The local community is in a state of shock. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time,"" he said. ""What is abundantly clear though, is that those responsible have shown absolute disregard for this community and endangered those nearby through this reckless and dangerous action. ""I would appeal to anyone with any information to make it known to the PSNI as soon as possible. There can be no justification whatsoever for this type of attack and those behind it need taken off our streets."" North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds said it was an ""appalling and brutal killing"". ""It is deeply shocking for people in this residential area,"" he said. ""Throughout the entire community, people will be sickened by this and will be thinking today about how often we used to hear about these kinds of killings in the past and making it very clear that we don't want any return to this kind of activity.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Doctors 'miss' underweight children, UCL study suggests","A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications. This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder. The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training. Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes. This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added. In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children. During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications. Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines. And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children. Complications There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels. The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood. Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished. Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training. ""In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country."" But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications. ""From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,"" he added. Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues. ""We are refreshing training on adolescent health,"" he said. ""And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK banks 'prepared for Brexit and trade war fall-out',"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter The comment came in its regular health check on the banks, the Financial Stability Report. The Bank said ""the perceived likelihood of no-deal Brexit has increased since the start of the year"". It said that ""material risks"" of economic disruption from such a scenario remain. However, there had been ""some improvement in the preparedness of the UK economy for no-deal Brexit"". Since last year, UK banks have been forced to hold back more capital, and demonstrate easy access to £1 trillion in funding (liquidity). The Bank says that such a buffer would allow the banking system to continue to lend into the economy, even if the UK were shut out of international markets for three months. This worst-case scenario stress test involves the economy shrinking by 4.7%, unemployment more than doubling to 9.5% and property prices falling by 33%. Shocks absorbed The Bank's key Financial Policy Committee went further than it has before by saying that the banking system would also be resilient to a disorderly Brexit occurring at the same time as a global trade war involving 25% tariffs on US-China trade, all global inputs and a 30% drop in the US stock market. ""Even if a protectionist-drive global slowdown were to spill over to the UK at the same time as a worst-case disorderly Brexit, the core UK banking system would be strong enough to absorb, rather than amplify, the resulting economic shocks and continue to serve UK households and businesses,"" it said. The Bank did say, though, that the impact of rising expectations of no-deal was already being seen in ""much weaker"" levels of investment in markets dependent on foreign investors - for example, commercial property. In the first quarter of this year, investment in commercial property was less than two-fifths (38%) of average levels in the past two years. For high-risk corporate borrowing (leveraged loans), it was a less than a fifth of the levels seen in 2017 and 2018. Commercial real estate prices are falling again now. The Bank also said it would be reviewing the macro-economic vulnerabilities of the economy on funding from ""open-ended"" funds, recently in the news after the problems with redemptions in Neil Woodford's fund. The Bank is also beginning work to assess the impact on financial sector of climate change risks.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Flinstshire man awarded £3,750 after care package stopped","The Public Services Ombusman for Wales ruled ""Mr X"" was failed by both Flintshire council and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. Mr X complained allegations against him were never put to him and he was denied payments to arrange his own care. The council and health board both admitted failings in the case. A report found the council was first aware of the allegations made by carers against Mr X in 2011 but had taken no action as it was considered a matter for the health board. A new private care company began delivering a care package two months later, funded by Betsi Cadwaladr. Further complaints about Mr X's behaviour were made in November 2013 but Mr X was not made aware of them, and he cancelled the care package two months later because he was dissatisfied with the service, the report said. 'Inadequate' In 2014, the health board and council made inquiries with the company about the allegations and meetings were held to discuss his case. An application for direct payments by Mr X was refused in April 2014 and he relied on help from a friend unitl June 2015. Mr X made complaints to the health board in November 2014 and the council in May 2015, with the council saying the health board had to finish its inquiries into the allegations against him first. The Ombusdman's investigating officer Steve Brisely found the council had failed to pass on the complaints to the health board in 2011 which would have enabled an investigation to take place then. The eventual investigation was inadequate, he added. ""It clearly would have been fair to put the allegations to Mr X in order for him to refute them, to provide his account of events or to modify his behaviour,"" said the report. ""I consider the failure to provide him with such an opportunity to be contrary to both natural justice and simple good practice."" In its response to the Ombudsman, the council accepted it had taken too long to respond to the complaint while the health board admitted it had no specific policy on how to deal with allegations where the care package was provided by an external company.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Doctors said Herefordshire woman's bowel cancer was piles,"After eight months ""back and forth"" to the surgery Beth Hewitt was referred to a consultant, who discovered a tumour. Mrs Hewitt said GPs told her: ""You're too young for anything like cancer."" The mother-of-two, from Hereford, had surgery to remove the tumour in April and is urging people to get symptoms checked. More than 2,500 people under 50 are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year, according to charity Bowel Cancer UK. After noticing blood in her stools in the summer of 2018, Mrs Hewitt was first prescribed cream for haemorrhoids. ""It was persistent, it would stop for about a week and then after a week it would carry on again,"" she said. Despite having no other symptoms associated with bowel cancer, as time passed the occupational therapist became worried the blood was an indicator of something more serious. ""I think I went back to (my GP) about five or six times... they were just saying, 'no you're too young for anything like cancer',"" said Mrs Hewitt. ""I'd think 'they're going to think I'm a bit mad because I'm worrying about nothing',"" she added. After securing a private referral Mrs Hewitt had a colonoscopy and scans to confirm the diagnosis, something she described as ""a relief"". About 18cm (7in) of her bowel was removed during surgery and further investigations revealed no further treatment was required, she said.

Hereford Medical Group, which runs two of the surgeries visited by Mrs Hewitt, said it was unable to comment on individual cases relating to patients, but hoped the story would ""increase awareness"".

Unhealthy food 'returning to school' warn caterers,"Six years after the Jamie Oliver campaign and the introduction of strict nutritional guidelines, caterers say they are getting requests for fatty foods and sweets. They say the requests are from some of England's new academy schools, which do not have to follow the guidelines. The government says it trusts schools to act in their pupils' best interest. And it says it has no reason to believe that academies will not provide healthy, balanced meals that meet the current nutritional standards The Local Authority Catering Association, which has 700 members across the UK, said it was concerned that there could be a return to unhealthy eating in schools. Linda Mitchell, from the association, said: ""Our members are telling us that they have been approached by academies to relax the rules and as providers to hundreds of thousands of schools we are concerned. ""They are being asked to put confectionery and other snacks back, especially at mid-morning. It is the return of the sausage roll to schools."" She said caterers were mostly being asked to put snacks in to vending machines in schools. ""It's a very small step before you are seeing the introduction of confectionery and fizzy drinks back in to those machines."" She suggested schools might be under pressure from pupils and parents to re-introduce certain foods and that some might be tempted by the high profit margins she said there were on sweet or fatty snacks. After the campaign for healthy school lunches led by the TV chef Jamie Oliver, schools in England had by law to meet stricter nutritional guidelines. Sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks disappeared from vending machines, which were removed or else dispensed healthy snacks. Under regulations in England and Northern Ireland - and guidelines in Scotland and Wales - schools should: In England, local authority schools also have to supply meals which comply with strict nutrient standards. From 2013, Wales intends to enshrine its guidelines in the law too. A spokesman for the Department for Education in Westminster said the school food regulations were the ""benchmark of high standards"". ""We trust schools to act in the best interest of their pupils - they know the importance of healthy school dinners and the benefits they bring,"" he said ""We have no reason to believe that academies will not provide healthy, balanced meals that meet the current nutritional standards. In fact, the School Food Trust tells us that some of the best schools in terms of attitudes to food and meals are academies."" He added that the government was asking the School Food Trust to carry out a small study of some academies to look at their approach to providing healthy school food to pupils.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: UK must prepare for 'hard winter' of flu - expert,"Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS must be ""ready"" for surges in flu and other similar illnesses. It comes ahead of England's first step towards easing lockdown, with all pupils returning to school on Monday. Most pupils have been learning from home since Christmas. Dr Hopkins, who is in charge of Public Health England's Covid strategy, said the UK needed to be ""better prepared"" than it was last autumn, when new, faster-spreading variants of the virus emerged. These drove infection rates up and forced further lockdown measures over the winter. Dr Hopkins told the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show: ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less. ""So we could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens."" Dr Hopkins said her role as a government advisor was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. During last year's winter, some 30 million people - more than ever before - were invited to get a free flu jab as ministers feared the dual threat it posed alongside coronavirus. Flu can be a serious condition - it kills around 11,000 people in England each year and many more people receive hospital treatment for it. People at high risk from flu are also most at risk from Covid-19. Flu poses additional threats during the Covid pandemic because: Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap out of national lockdown aims for all coronavirus restrictions to be lifted by 21 June at the earliest. But top scientists and medics have warned that restrictions to curb Covid infections could continue into next winter. Mask-wearing and working from home could be among ""baseline"" measures expected to continue until then, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
High heels row: Petition for work dress code law rejected,"The Equalities Office said existing legislation was ""adequate"" but it would issue guidelines to firms this summer. The issue was debated in Parliament in March after Nicola Thorp, who was sent home for wearing flat shoes, set up a petition with more 152,000 signatures. Miss Thorp said the decision to stop short of a law change was a ""cop-out"". She began her petition after being told to leave a temp job for refusing to wear a ""2-4in heel"". A subsequent parliamentary investigation into heels and company dress codes found ""widespread discrimination"" in workplaces. But Miss Thorp, an equality campaigner from London, said it was a ""shame"" the law would not be changed. ""It shouldn't be down to people like myself,"" she said. ""The government should take responsibility and put it in legislation. I do think it is a little bit of a cop-out."" Employers 'flout' laws A government spokesperson said it was already against the law to discriminate on the grounds of gender - but that this could be made ""clearer to employers"". ""It is unacceptable and is against the law,"" the spokesperson said. ""Dress codes must include equivalent requirements for both men and women."" On Friday, the government said the law was ""adequate"" in a formal response to the petition and investigation. It said companies should assess whether their rules are ""relevant and lawful"". ""But we recognise that some employers lack awareness of the law or even choose to flout it,"" the government said. It added: ""The Government Equalities Office will be producing guidance on dress codes in the workplace as a specific response to the Thorp petition and the issues it raises."" It comes after an investigation by the Petitions Committee and Women and Equalities Committee found ""potentially discriminatory dress codes are commonplace"". Maria Miller, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, said she welcomed the decision to introduce new guidelines. ""This petition, and the committees' inquiry, have reinforced the need for effective enforcement of legislation and for employers and employees to be aware of their obligations and rights,"" she said. ""We welcome the commitments made by the government to increasing awareness of those rights."" Ms Miller said she hoped the next government, which will be voted in at the election on 8 June, would ""monitor how this changes women's experiences of the workplace"". Helen Jones, who chairs the Petitions Committee, added that Miss Thorp's petition and the resultant investigation had done a ""great deal"" to raise awareness. ""The government has accepted our recommendation that it should be doing much more to improve understanding among employers and employees alike, to prevent discriminatory practices in the workplace,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Derek Bonnard: Cleveland officer 'branded criminal',"Derek Bonnard, 49, and the force's chief constable Sean Price, 55, are facing separate disciplinary hearings into alleged gross misconduct. Mr Price is also the subject of a criminal investigation, but a similar probe into Mr Bonnard has been dropped. The 26-year veteran said he was living ""with a level of shame"" despite nothing yet being proved. Mr Price is facing 11 allegations and Mr Bonnard seven, as part of an investigation being led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). They involve allegations surrounding the misuse of public funds and corporate credit cards. The pair, arrested on 3 August last year, deny any wrongdoing. 'Incorrect and unfair' Mr Price is on bail as part of a separate investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption, which is expected to continue into 2013. Mr Bonnard was released from police bail last month. He said: ""For 26 years I have been a highly professional police officer and I have loved being a police officer. ""But for the last year I have lived with a level of shame. ""I have done nothing wrong in terms of criminality, but I have suffered abuse in the street, where people have made reference to me as a criminal and that is very difficult. It is completely incorrect and unfair."" ""My wife and my family have also suffered because of what's going on and that has probably been the biggest burden for me. ""I've had to watch them struggle through this knowing that I am innocent of any criminality and that it has taken a year for that to be confirmed by the investigation team.

South Korea warns North against satellite launch,"North Korea said on Tuesday it intended to carry out the launch between 8 and 25 February. Critics say it is a cover for a test of ballistic missile technology. Japan's defence minister said he had issued an order to shoot down any missile that threatened to fall on Japanese territory. The US has said any North Korean launch would be an ""egregious violation"" of a UN ban on missile launches by North Korea, and called for more sanctions. North Korea has always said its space programme is peaceful, but it is believed to be developing an intercontinental ballistic missile. It also conducted its fourth nuclear bomb test on 6 January, drawing international condemnation. North Korea's rocket launches North Korea's missile programme How potent are the threats? Isolated country's nuclear tests A world leader in dramatic rhetoric Cho Tae-yang, a senior South Korean presidential official, said on Wednesday that the satellite plan was considered a ""direct challenge to the international community"". ""We warn that if North Korea proceeds with a long-range missile launch, the international society will ensure that the North pays searing consequences for it."" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the launch plan was a ""serious provocation"", while Russia's foreign ministry said Pyongyang showed ""an outrageous disregard for the universally recognised norms of international law"". Meanwhile, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: ""`We hope all sides show restraint and... avoid any moves that may increase the tensions on the [Korean] Peninsula."" China is Pyongyang's biggest trading partner and only ally, although relations have cooled since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father. China's top nuclear envoy Wu Dawei is currently visiting Pyongyang. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) said on Tuesday that it had been notified of Pyongyang's plans to launch a satellite between 8 and 25 February. However North Korean media do not appear to have reported on the DPRK's letter to the UN maritime agency so far, says BBC Monitoring, meaning many North Koreans will not be aware of it. Analysts say a new launch would allow North Korea to test some - but not all - of the technology needed for a long-range nuclear strike. The recent nuclear test and the planned satellite launch could be part of a build-up to the seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea due to be held in coming months - the first to be held since 1980 - where leader Kim Jong-un is expected to show off North Korea's nuclear programme, experts say. The North last conducted a long-range rocket launch in December 2012, successfully putting into orbit an object Pyongyang claimed was a communications satellite with the three-stage Unha-3 carrier. The UN Security Council subsequently called it a ""clear violation"" of resolutions banning North Korea from missiles tests, and imposed sanctions.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Vodafone and TalkTalk report surge in internet use,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor More people are working from home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, putting more demand on all networks. TalkTalk, another internet provider, said that its daytime network traffic had risen 20% since Monday. One EU official has suggested that online TV services should stream content in lower resolution to protect broadband infrastructure. On Wednesday evening, European Union commissioner Thierry Breton called on content providers to switch to standard definition feeds to prevent networks from being overloaded. But the internet providers have played down suggestions that they cannot cope. Extended hours Use of remote-access technologies, webmail and video-conferencing apps are taking their toll. Vodafone says spikes in usage are ""largely the same"" as before in terms of the total amount of data being uploaded and downloaded. But the ""busy hours"", which normally run from 18:00 to 20:00, now extend all the way back to lunchtime. ""We have enough headroom to meet growing demand and to keep the UK connected,"" a spokesman told BBC News. ""Our network team is keeping a constant watch on the situation."" Other network operators have noted streamed television and games downloads still make use of considerably more bandwidth. One of the most popular corporate video chat apps, Microsoft Teams, typically requires 0.5-1Mbps, while streaming a TV programme in 4K and high dynamic range (HDR) can require a constant rate of 20-44Mbps. The forthcoming launch of Disney+ in the UK, which will offer 4K-resolution content, and the BBC's plans to provide classes for children online because of schools being suspended, could therefore put the networks under more strain. However, TalkTalk rejected the idea that its systems were at any imminent risk. ""We continually optimise our network for both our consumer and business customers and are well prepared to ensure they receive reliable connectivity,"" it said. That does not mean that every service will necessarily run smoothly. Blizzard - the company behind multiplayer games including World of Warcraft and Overwatch - reported its service had suffered as a result of a cyber-attack. And the company had previously warned users ""may experience increased waiting times"" as a result of a decision to allow staff to work from home because of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Coronavirus in South Africa: Misuse of Covid-19 funds 'frightening',"Kimi Makwetu says the audit uncovered ""frightening findings"". In some cases personal protective equipment (PPE) was bought for five times more than the price the national treasury had advised. The report also has flagged up 30,000 relief grants which ""require further investigation"". Mr Makwetu has been tracking the spending of 500 billion rand ($26bn; £19bn) which is equivalent to 10% of the country's gross domestic product. ""A lot of the effort that we put into this on the detection side of things has revealed a number of frightening findings that require to be followed up very quickly so that there is no significant passage of time before the required actions are implemented,"" he said at a press conference on Wednesday. The allocated funds were meant to assist vulnerable households with food parcels, unemployment grants, support small business, farmers and to also procure personal protective equipment. Will the corrupt get caught? By Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Corruption was ""amplified"" - that's the term used by South Africa's auditor general in his report on the misuse of funds which were aimed at mitigating the impact of coronavirus in the country. Wednesday's announcement of the damning findings has angered many who had suspected there was fraud and corruption in how the government dealt with the allocation of funds, particularly the millions of dollars which were supposed to purchase PPE for schools and hospitals. South Africans expect President Cyril Ramaphosa to act decisively on this issue. It appears he has already begun. Politicians accused of corruption, particularly those within the governing ANC, were told to resign and open themselves up for investigation by law enforcement agencies who have started to investigate many illegal transactions which took place. But South Africans want to see real action - they want to see politicians facing trial and being convicted for corruption. That's the only way to convince them that the government is serious about tackling corruption. In May, South Africa introduced social relief of distress grants of 350 rand per month for people who are unemployed. But Mr Makwetu said the system was vulnerable to hackers, fraud and ""double dipping"". Out of four million people in the database he said the ""somewhere around 30,000 beneficiaries require further investigation"". He also said there was a need for the area of procurement of PPE to be ""further scrutinised"" as ""there are instances of the price being 200% and, in some instances, fives times more"" than the price the national treasury had advised. He referred a list of cases pointing to the high risk of fraud to investigators and is expected to publish a fuller report in November.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Child's cerebral palsy book to help others understand her life,"By Liam EvansBBC Radio Cymru So the little girl wrote a book, explaining what her life was like and the challenges she faced.

""When I was younger I had problems because I wasn't allowed to go in an electric wheelchair back then so everybody was fighting over who would push me around,"" said Elan, who lives in Cynwyd, near Corwen in Denbighshire. So she decided she wanted to make a book to help other children understand she was just like them, and let teachers know it was okay to talk about it. Now she wants to help children of all disabilities to be able to explain their conditions in a similar way. ""It was stuff like pictures about different disabilities, information about how my limbs are affected and how autistic people's minds work differently,"" said Elan, who told BBC Radio Cymru she wants to compete in Paralympics. ""They found it quite interesting and did have a few questions about physical stuff."" While Elan had a positive experience at her mainstream school, Ysgol Bro Dyfrdwy, her mother said this was not the case for all disabled pupils in Wales. ""Things have been very natural for Elan in school and we would like every school in Wales to be like that in the way they have supported us really,"" she said. ""Now that's not the case everywhere in Wales, and especially with hidden disabilities it is a lot more difficult."" Ms Williams called for a more open and honest discussion when it comes to disability and wants to see the book used as a starting point to help people understand better. ""Elan is quite proactive about her disability and will often tell people about it before they have asked,"" she added.

She was transferred from all-male HMP Bristol to HMP Eastwood Park after 150,000 people called for her to move. Hudson, who was released on Friday, said being in a male prison was ""horrific"". She spent seven days at HMP Bristol before being moved to the all-female Eastwood Park. 'Very scary' ""I've lived my life as a female for over half a decade and to be incarcerated at a male prison was too much,"" she said. ""I didn't think I'd end up in a men's prison. ""I had a lot of men trying to get me to show my breasts, I'd seen a lot of violence - it was very, very scary. ""I thought I was going to get attacked, I thought I may be raped. ""That kind of sounds dramatic but at the end of the day I've a large bust, I have bleached blonde hair, I've worked as a glamour model. ""It was not the right place for me."" Hudson, who is still legally a man, said she was put on a segregation wing at Eastwood Park. ""I wasn't allowed any interaction with the other female prisoners. I was on lock-up for 23 hours a day."" She said she knew nothing of the campaign to get her moved. ""When I did find out I was so humbled,"" she said. 'Complete hell' ""It meant people on the outside recognised who I was, they knew I'm female and I'd lived my life a female. ""That support has made me feel like I am a woman."" She said hearing fellow trans prisoners Vikki Thompson, 21, and Joanne Latham, 38, had killed themselves in all-male prisons had made her determined to campaign for a change in the law. ""My heart dropped because I knew what those two girls went through. ""I would have done the same I think. ""I didn't ask to be transgender, they didn't ask to be transgender - we were all thrown into the situation that made our lives complete hell. ""If something doesn't change soon then there will be more deaths. ""I'm not doing this for publicity, I'm doing this for those two girls who killed themselves.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Afghanistan war: Deadly Taliban attack 'destroys' hospital,"Many of the victims in the attack in Qalat city were doctors and patients, according to local media reports. Later, officials said another 16 people, many of them civilians, had been killed in a US air strike aimed at Islamic State militants in the east. Last month, at least 473 civilians were killed in the conflict, the BBC found. Civilians made up a fifth of all known casualties during the month of August, our research revealed. What happened in the hospital bombing? A senior defence ministry official in the capital told Reuters news agency the ""huge"" bomb had been carried by a ""mini-truck"" before it was detonated near the hospital in Qalat. It was the main health facility in Zabul province, according to reports. Governor Rahmatullah Yarmal said it had been ""destroyed"". The Taliban have said they were targeting government intelligence offices, next door to the hospital. The final death toll from Thursday morning's attack is still unclear. Zabul's deputy governor said 20 were confirmed dead, with some 90 injured. People at the scene described seeing women and children pulled from the rubble. ""It was horrific,"" university student Atif Baloch said, according to news agency AFP. Ambulances have been ferrying casualties to hospital in the neighbouring province of Kandahar. What happened in the air strike? The Afghan defence ministry says an attack took place on Wednesday night in Khogyani district in Nangarhar province which was aimed at Islamic State fighters, according to Reuters news agency. But a Nangarhar security official confirmed to the BBC that 15 civilians had been killed and six others wounded in the strike. According to reports, those killed had been working in a pine nut field. ""The workers had lit a bonfire and were sitting together when a drone targeted them,"" tribal elder Malik Rahat Gul told Reuters. An investigation into the incident is being carried out. What is the security situation in Afghanistan? The Afghan conflict continues to be one of the deadliest in the world. The BBC found an average of 74 people were killed every day throughout August. Hopes had risen that the 18-year conflict could be coming to an end after it was revealed the Taliban and US had almost reached a peace deal in early September. But US President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement after a Taliban attack in Kabul killed a US soldier and 11 others on 6 September. The Taliban have continued to carry out near daily attacks since then, with national elections due at the end of the month. On Tuesday, the group targeted an election rally where President Ashraf Ghani had been due to speak, leaving 26 people dead. However, despite the Taliban attacks hitting the headlines, United Nations statistics have shown more civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces in the first half of 2019 than by insurgents.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hillary Clinton's approval bubble has popped,"By Anthony ZurcherEditor, Echo Chambers According to the survey, 43% of registered voters have a positive view of the former secretary of state and first lady, while 41% have a negative opinion. That marks a considerable decline from her February 2009 numbers, as she began her four-year stint as secretary of state. Then she recorded 59% positive to 22% negative. The Wall Street Journal's Patrick O'Connor says this trend is a result of Mrs Clinton's being increasingly seen through the lens of partisan politics, as she mulls a bid for the presidency in 2016. ""The more Hillary Clinton looks like a candidate, the less invincible she appears,"" he writes. A closer look at the numbers indicates that the bulk of Mrs Clinton's decline can be attributed to Republicans whose views of her have dimmed. Her disapproval rating among conservatives has jumped from 52% in 2009 to 70% today. It's all about one's frame of reference. When compared to President Barack Obama, Mrs Clinton may seem appealing to conservatives. But standing on her own, as a potential standard-bearer for the Democrats, she takes on all the political baggage and negative connotations of her party. Back in late June, when Mrs Clinton's poll numbers first began to show some weakness, the New York Times's Brendan Nyhan made note of this phenomenon. ""Mrs Clinton's re-entry on the political stage over the last few weeks is turning her back into what she was before her stint as secretary of state: an intensely polarising political figure,"" he wrote. He compared her situation to that of a once-popular Republican as he contemplated a presidential bid in 2008, John McCain. He was admired by many Democrats when he was criticising his own party and staying above the partisan fray. But once he was perceived as a political threat, the gloves came off. ""We tend to overrate the importance of candidate image, which is largely a function of the flow of partisan messages,"" he wrote. ""When opposition elites withhold criticism during, say, a presidential honeymoon or a foreign policy crisis, politicians can seem unstoppable, but when normal politics resume, their images - and their poll numbers - quickly return to earth."" Mrs Clinton's potential Republican opponents should refrain from taking too much joy at the survey results, however. Leading contenders like former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul all have net-negative approval numbers. Florida Senator Marco Rubio comes the closest to positive among the minority of respondents who have an opinion of him, with a 21%-21% split. Although Mrs Clinton's popularity drop may have been entirely predictable, it still presents a threat to the former first lady's political ambitions. Part of her appeal to Democratic voters has been predicated on what a formidable opponent she would be in 2016. That may still be the case, but it's getting harder to point to survey statistics to back that up.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Notting Hill Carnival: Police officers 'dread' the event,"They have called for a ""full-scale review"" of Carnival after eight of them were hurt and taken to hospital. Police made 454 arrests and four people were wounded in stabbings during the annual celebration. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said the event was being ""hijacked"" by troublemakers. 'Bank Holiday battleground' He said: ""Last year we had an officer stabbed. This year colleagues were assaulted, abused and spat at. Forty-three were injured - with eight needing hospital treatment. How can that be right? It's completely and utterly unacceptable. ""A seemingly growing number of people appear intent on hijacking this Carnival and turning it into a Bank Holiday battleground. The Glastonbury music festival had 40 arrests this year. Notting Hill had 10 times that amount. ""The organisers need to understand that this event cannot carry on regardless. I think many Londoners will wonder whether the significant amount of taxpayers' money spent policing this event is frankly worth it."" A 15-year-old boy was stabbed in Wornington Road on Sunday. His injuries were critical but are now non-life threatening. A 14-year-old boy was arrested. Three other males, aged 15 to 20, were also wounded in knife attacks on the opening day of the festival. More than 400 people were arrested at Carnival, the highest since 2008. Police said they had seized 90 offensive weapons while patrolling the event. Officers also seized a large canister of compressed nitrous oxide - so-called laughing gas - which had the capacity to fill 2,500 smaller canisters and had a street value of more than £150,000. Ambulance and first aid crews treated more than 1,000 people, mostly for alcohol-related injuries. A spokesperson for the London Mayor said his office would work to tackle gang and knife crime, and City Hall would ""thoroughly review"" the Carnival. Kensington MP Victoria Borwick said she was ""very disappointed that people want to spoil the carnival by using it as a cover to commit crime and inflict terrible injuries"".

Five Sisters Zoo fire: Glazier offers to help rebuild reptile house,"Derrick Findlay, 1st Choice Glazing director, offered to donate glass and timber for a new reptile house, as well as joiners and tradesmen to build it. The fire broke out in the reptile house of the Five Sisters Zoo at Polbeth, West Calder, at about 03:50 on Sunday. A ""substantial"" number of animals died in the fire. However, about 50 firefighters stopped the flames spreading to other enclosures. They also rescued two dwarf west African crocodiles and a female otter which were near the reptile house. No people were injured in the fire. Mr Findlay, director of the Bathgate-based company, said he often takes his three-year-old son to Five Sisters Zoo which is a ""centre for the community"". He posted a message to the zoo's Facebook page, offering 1st Choice's services for free. It reads: ""I take my wee boy there at least once a month, we usually spend between two and three hours feeding the animals and it's a great place to go. ""It's a real centre for the community in West Lothian. ""In a nutshell, we are offering to rebuild the reptile house, and help out in any other way we can. ""We're offering the glass, timber and manpower to build it back up to what it should be. ""I've got my team here, and since I made the offer to the zoo other companies have come forward and said they want to provide assistance in other trades. ""So we've got a full bank of people just waiting for the button to be pushed."" The message added: ""It's obviously still very raw for all connected to the zoo, so we're happy just to take their directions on it. ""When I posted the message I had no idea it would build up this much momentum - we've had about 46,000 likes on Facebook for it."" To date, the owners of Five Sisters have received around £18,000 in donations from companies and members of the public. Lesley Coupar, from marketing and visitor services at the zoo, said staff are ""astounded"" at the response. She said: ""We have been absolutely amazed and overwhelmed by the community support and response to this terrible tragedy. ""We've been totally swamped on Facebook with messages of support and people offering to help. It really is absolutely wonderful. ""Derrick has made such a generous offer and we are absolutely astounded by it and all the other offers of help.

BBC forgotten list 'sets precedent',"By Dave LeeTechnology reporter, BBC News The links were removed as part of the ""right to be forgotten"" ruling put in place by the European court. It allows individuals to request certain links do not show up when a person searches their name. The BBC published a full list of stories that had been removed so far. It would continue to do so, said David Jordan, head of editorial policy. ""It's impossible to have a meaningful debate if you've not got an idea about what's being de-listed,"" he said. He said while it was up to individual media organisations to decide how best to be transparent with audiences over what has been removed, he felt the BBC had taken the lead ""without being provocative"". He denied the suggestion that publishing the links was bringing more attention to those who had wanted to be forgotten. ""It doesn't make [the stories] more findable for anybody looking for a name,"" he said. ""What it does is give a sense of and a flavour of what kind of material is being delisted. That's important."" Reputation management The European Union Court of Justice ruled last year that search engine links to ""irrelevant"" and outdated data about a person should be erased on request. It only affects searches made by users in the European Union. The decision arose after a Spanish man complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on Google's search results infringed his privacy. A removal does not mean it is taken off the internet, nor the search engine as a whole. Instead, it means the specific link will not appear when a search for a person's name is conducted. Google has described the ruling as ""disappointing"". Internet rights campaigners are concerned that the rule amounts to censorship. Transparency Soon after the ruling, Google began informing media organisations whenever a link had been removed from search results - a move which was said to have angered regulators. Mr Jordan praised the search engine for continuing to keep the media informed, but called for a better consultation system to be put in place. ""We believe that delisting links in this way without consultation, and without the publisher having some input in the discussion, is unfortunate,"" he said. After seeking the advice of media organisations, Google implemented an appeal system. One story that had been removed - about a court case involving members of the Real IRA - was relisted after the BBC appealed against the decision.

Obama London visit: Drones to be banned in the capital,"The restrictions on drones, which are remotely-controlled, unmanned aircraft, will apply between 09:00 BST on Thursday and 22:30 on Sunday. The ban also extends between London and Windsor, where Mr Obama will have lunch with the Queen on Friday. Authorities said it was a routine ban, similar to those used at sports events. It comes after a London-bound flight is believed to have hit a drone on Sunday. Detectives launched an investigation after the pilot of the British Airways flight approaching Heathrow reported his aircraft being hit by a drone. Police say the drone was being flown near the area of Richmond Park in south-west London. Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? The rules for flying domestic drones Announcing the restrictions, the UK's National Air Traffic Service said they were part of an ""overarching security plan"" for the visit of Mr Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Drones will be banned from flying over a large part of the capital, extending from Purley in the south to Haringey in the north. Restrictions are in place between Windsor and London on Friday - when the Obamas will have lunch at Windsor Castle. The ban also extends between Stansted Airport and the capital on Thursday night and Sunday morning. The Civil Aviation Authority says drones can usually be flown up to 400ft (122m). However, the regulations ban aircraft from flying below 762m (2,500ft), unless they are using Heathrow, Stansted or London City airports. Aircraft at London Heliport, RAF Northolt, and those being operated by the emergency services are to be excluded. The restrictions also apply to ""any small balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any parachute"" in the relevant areas. Super Bowl ban Similar rules have previously been introduced for high-profile visits and major sporting fixtures, including the London Olympics in 2012 and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Drones were recently banned at American Football's Super Bowl. The Obamas' visit to the UK stay is part of a tour including Saudi Arabia and Germany. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will host the couple on Friday, Kensington Palace has said. The president will also stage a press conference with Prime Minister David Cameron.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"US planning full Afghan pullout, Obama tells Karzai","Mr Obama conveyed the message in a phone call to Mr Karzai, who has refused to sign a security agreement. The US insists this agreement must be in place before it commits to leaving some troops behind for counter-insurgent operations and training. The US has had troops in Afghanistan since 2001 when it toppled the Taliban. Its forces went into the country following the 9/11 attacks on the US. With Afghan and Western allies, they quickly overthrew the Taliban authorities, but have faced insurgent attacks since then. Correspondents say the disagreement over the bilateral security agreement (BSA) is the latest step in the long and deteriorating relationship between Washington and Mr Karzai, who was once seen as a key US ally. The BSA, which offers legal protection for US troops and defines a post-2014 Nato training and anti-insurgent mission, was agreed by the two countries last year after months of negotiation. It was endorsed at a national gathering (Loya Jirga) of Afghan elders in Kabul in November. 'Contingency planning' But Mr Karzai has refused to sign the deal until a peace process is under way with the Taliban, adding that if he were to sign it, he would become responsible if Afghans were killed by US bombs. ""President Obama told President Karzai that because he has demonstrated that it is unlikely that he will sign the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement), the United States is moving forward with additional contingency planning,"" the White House said in a statement. ""Specifically, President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014. ""Furthermore, the longer we go without a BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 US mission will be smaller in scale and ambition."" While Mr Karzai has refused to sign the BSA, some candidates in April's Afghan presidential elections have indicated they would. Mr Karzai, who has served two terms as Afghanistan's first and only president since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, is obliged by law to stand down after the next election. Analysts say the US statement clearly implies that Mr Karzai's stance will harm his country's security long after he leaves office. The White House statement came as US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel flew to Brussels for a Nato meeting at which Afghanistan is due to be discussed.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Travellers from 33 countries must quarantine,"Travellers will spend two weeks and pay at least €1,875 (£1,614) to stay at one of 24 hotels across the republic. Quarantine will apply to those arriving from 33 countries and those without a negative Covid-19 test. The Irish government portal is now live for bookings. Quarantine officially begins at 04:00 GMT on Friday. The Tifco Hotel Group has been awarded the contract and will be responsible for transport, security, health and well being services. Among its portfolio are hotels close to Dublin and Cork airports. The countries on the Irish government's ""high risk"" list are: Angola, Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Eswatini, French Guiana, Guyana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Rwanda, Seychelles, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe. People travelling from those restricted countries who do not quarantine face a fine of up to €2,000 or a prison sentence of up to a month. Travellers who pass through an airport or a port in the named countries must also quarantine. The Department of Health said that when it comes to transportation, the Defence Forces will oversee the process. When people arrive, the Defence Forces will escort them to their quarantine location and will support them through their time. The Tifco Hotel Group will have a licensed security contractor at each hotel but gardaí are said to be ""available as a point of escalation in response to any such incidents"". In an interview for RTÉ Radio One's Morning Ireland, Harry McGee, the Irish Times political correspondent, said it was his understanding that no gardaí (Irish police) will be involved in any properties unless there are breaches of the law. ""It will be private security firms who operate, there will be strict protocols as to what they can and can't do."" People will receive all meals in their rooms and will be expected to remain there unless there is an emergency. A designated safe and secure space for fresh air breaks and exercise will be available at the hotel. Mr McGee said that the Republic's National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) wanted to make quarantine mandatory for everyone arriving in the country. However, he acknowledged that there are problems with the border and Ireland's relationship with the UK on common travel which would make quarantine for all difficult from a legal and practical perspective.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford denies drug video allegations,"The Toronto Star said that two of its reporters were shown the video clip - reportedly filmed on a smartphone - by someone trying to sell it to the paper. The newspaper says that it cannot verify the video's authenticity. Mr Ford called the allegations ""ridiculous"" when he emerged from his house on Friday. Later, outside his office, Mr Ford refused to take questions but in brief comments said it was ""another story with respect to the Toronto Star going after me"". He added: ""That's all I've got to say for now."" Mr Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, earlier told the Toronto Sun: ""We're just trying to see whether or not such a video exists and whether or not any video has been doctored or altered."" The Toronto Star said two of its reporters were shown the video on 3 May, after meeting an anonymous tipster in a car park. 'Well-lit room' The newspaper said the footage appeared to show Mr Ford ""sitting in a chair, wearing a white shirt, top buttons open, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe"". The Toronto Star said that although it had no way to verify the authenticity of the video, the clip ""appears to clearly show Ford in a well-lit room"". The paper added that it ""did not pay money and did not obtain a copy of the video"". In an editorial, the Toronto Star said the city needed answers ""right away"" about the incident. ""It's not enough for the mayor to try and slough this off with a one-word denial and point a finger, yet again, at the Star for reporting on it,"" it said. Toronto Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday told reporters it was ""shocking to see it on the front page of a paper"" and that he did not believe the article and still had confidence in the mayor. The editor of US online news site Gawker, John Cook, said in a blog post that he had also seen the clip but did not want to pay the six-figure amount demanded by the video's owner. Mr Ford's lawyer reportedly sent an email to Gawker, threatening legal action. ""Mayor Ford denies such... took place, and if such posting occurs, it is false and defamatory, and you will be held legally accountable,"" the email read, according to Gawker.

Labour rules out Royal Mail renationalisation pledge,"But he spelled out a series of new obligations that the party would place on the company. The announcement came shortly before Royal Mail shares are to be sold. Labour's conference voted to commit the party to renationalisation, but sources made it clear at the time the policy would not be adopted by the leadership. The government will sell between 40.1% and 52.2% of Royal Mail under its privatisation proposal, which gives the company a value of £2.6bn-£3.3bn. In addition, 10% per cent of its shares will be given to Royal Mail employees. Mr Umunna said the party would require Royal Mail to deliver services through the Post Office beyond 2022, when the current agreement between the two expires. There would also be a new, but unspecified, price control on stamps and new requirements on other postal operators. 'Safeguarding' services He said Labour would ""secure"" the universal service obligation - which guarantees post can be sent anywhere in the UK for the same price - beyond 2015. The party argues the obligation is vulnerable because it could easily be weakened by a statutory instrument in Parliament. Mr Umunna characterised the announcement as an attempt to ""safeguard"" the services that consumers and businesses will receive from a privatised Royal Mail. Writing on the Huffington Post website he said: ""I have been very clear that we are not in a position to pledge to renationalise Royal Mail if we get into government in 2015. ""I do not know how much Royal Mail shares will be trading at in May 2015, so I do not know how much it would cost to renationalise. ""No credible future business secretary would therefore make such a pledge."" The Communication Workers Union proposed a recent Labour conference motion calling for renationalisation, but is expected to welcome the proposal for new obligations to be placed on the company. Before the conference Mr Umunna told the BBC's Sunday Politics that he would not write a ""blank cheque"" to renationalise Royal Mail. Ministers argue privatisation will give Royal Mail access to private capital needed to modernise its business. The last Labour government planned to sell a 30% stake in Royal Mail but Lord Mandelson dropped the proposal in 2009, blaming a lack of credible bidders.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dangerous dogs: PM urged not to treat pit bulls as 'collateral damage',"Labour's Gordon Marsden said pit bull-type dogs were routinely put down due to a law which designates bull terriers as a prohibited breed and judges them on physical attributes, not behaviour. He said the thought of the rescue dog he owned being destroyed ""because her face did not fit in court is chilling"". The PM assured him the issue would be looked at ""very carefully"". Raising the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Marsden highlighted a recent report by the Commons Environment Committee, which called for an overhaul of the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act and its specific breed definitions. The pit bull terrier is one of the four breeds banned by the act, although owners can get a certificate of exemption if a court believes the dog is not dangerous. MPs have said the law is dysfunctional because the majority of deaths caused by dogs since then have been by non-specified breeds. They also criticise the fact that specified breeds cannot be transferred to new owners even if they are not judged to pose any threat. Mr Marsden referred to comments made by Environment Minister Lord Gardiner, when he appeared before the committee, about the case of a pit-bull type dog which had to be put down by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Asked whether he regarded the death of the dog, even though he may have been ""good-tempered"", as just ""collateral damage"", the minister replied yes. The Blackpool South MP told Mrs May this was unacceptable and the specific breed definition needed to be reformed as a matter of urgency. ""Hundreds of pitbull-type dogs are confiscated yearly with no impact on dog-bite numbers,"" he said. ""Will the prime minister ask the environment secretary to act urgently on the committee's recommendations? ""My wonderful bull terrier-type dog was rescued from the streets and to think of her being destroyed because her face did not fit in court is chilling."" Animal charities have called for changes to the way pit-bull type dogs are assessed for the purposes of the law. At the moment, their parentage and genetic heritage are not taken into account. Dogs are evaluated, instead, largely on their physical characteristics, measured against a 100-point scale, of which ten points are allocated to the dog's attitude and behaviour. The PM thanked Mr Marsden for highlighting this issue and pledged a review. ""I had not looked at the detail of the report on that particular issue but I can assure him that the environment secretary is himself a keen dog owner, as indeed is the chancellor, and he will be looking at this issue very carefully,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Analysis: What is behind Nissan UK's success?,"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News Even before the announcement that it is to build the new Invitation car, Nissan's Sunderland plant enjoyed surprising success with its Qashqai crossover model, and this has been succeeded by the also successful Juke, a similar but smaller crossover vehicle. In Europe, Nissan sells one in four crossovers, which combine the high ride of 4x4s with the fuel economy and driving style of ordinary cars. But beyond its ability to deliver the right models at the right time, the plant has also benefited from the historically strong yen against sterling, which has made it more attractive to produce in the UK. And with the pound being historically weak against other key currencies, especially the euro, much of the Nissan production is shipped abroad. So much, in fact, that Nissan is now the UK's biggest car exporter. 'Quality and efficiency' Sunderland's success in attracting investment from its parent company also rests on the plant's reputation as a particularly efficient car factory, as well as its close relationships with local suppliers and its ability to support new ones. Nissan's chief executive Carlos Ghosn, who is also the chief of French carmaker Renault, is well aware that ""the Sunderland plant is setting an important benchmark for quality and efficiency in Europe and around the world"". Which is why he is investing some £420m to produce the electric Leaf here, as well as to make lithium-ion batteries for both Renault and Nissan. Sunderland is also expected to be a major supplier of cars as Nissan continues to ramp up its European dealer network, adding some 1,000 new dealerships between 2006 and 2014 in an effort to overtake Toyota. Nissan's investments in the north east, which have boosted employment in the otherwise economically depressed region, have been warmly welcomed by the government, which deems the car industry's contribution a vital contributor to its strategy to bolster manufacturing and thus rebalance the UK economy. Attracting investment Indeed, Nissan's strength is by no means unique in today's UK motor industry. ""Eleven of the global volume manufacturers have bases here, backed by 19 of the world's top 20 suppliers,"" Business Secretary Vince Cable said last year during a dinner arranged by industry body SMMT. In 2011 alone: ""The year saw the UK attract a remarkable level of investment, with global vehicle manufacturers committing in excess of £4bn to plants and facilities, securing future model production and employment,"" observes SMMT's chief executive, Paul Everitt. ""Despite the uncertainty within the eurozone, there is real confidence in the future of UK manufacturing. ""It will make an increasing contribution to exports, economic growth and employment in the coming years.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Storm Ciara: High winds lead to disruption across Europe,"High winds and heavy rain continue to batter areas of Ireland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Scandinavia. The storm led to travel disruptions and the cancellation of several public events over the weekend. Forecasters predict it will continue to move south-eastwards, bringing gusts of over 90mph (145km/h) in some areas. In Ireland, around 14,000 homes and businesses were left without power as the country begins counting ballots for its general election. Organisers also cancelled an opening ceremony to mark the beginning of Galway's year as the European Capital of Culture, citing public safety. Over in Denmark, a woman and a child had to be rescued from the North Sea after they were swept into the water while walking along a pier. France issued amber warnings - its second-highest level - for 42 regions of the country, including Normandy, the Ardennes and Lorraine. People in the country have been warned to stay away from coastal and wooded areas, several cities have closed off parks and seaside promenades. Forecasters in Norway, meanwhile, have issued red warnings - their highest risk level - for some southern and western areas due to concerns about high seas. These same concerns have also led to the suspension of ferry services in the English Channel. Gale force winds grounded hundreds of flights in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Frankfurt, Brussels and Amsterdam Schipol were among the airports affected. German railway firm Deutsche Bahn also warned of severe disruptions in the north of the country. Storm Ciara - known as Elsa in Norway, and Sabine in Germany and Switzerland - is the most severe storm to hit the continent so far this year. In recent years, several national forecasters have adopted the practice of naming large storms to help the public monitor severe weather. But while Irish, Dutch, French and British have agreed to adopt the same names, Germany and Switzerland have their own separate agreement, as does Norway. For the UK, this year's storm names have already been chosen, with Dennis next in line. Have you been affected by Storm Ciara? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Derby staff and students given climate change anxiety therapy,"Eco-anxiety sessions are being held at the University of Derby to tackle feelings of anger, guilt and grief. One student involved in the workshops said climate change makes her feel as though she is ""not going to have a future"". Dr Jamie Bird, who hopes to expand the sessions, said people suffer ""climate grief"" when seeing what is being lost. The sessions have been offered to people from climate activist groups in Derbyshire, and some faculties at the university, since August. Student Claire Prowse said: ""It makes me very anxious because every time I look at the news I rarely see any good news about the environment. ""It just makes me think I'm not going to have a future."" Nicola Grigg, who also attends the sessions, said: ""It makes me feel isolated and lonely. ""It makes me feel guilty because I don't feel like I have the power to change it."" Dr Bird, deputy head of health and social care research at the university, said: ""More and more I think there's this recognition that people are feeling not only anxious but also a sense of loss, or it might be a sense of anger or guilt or shame. ""Helplessness underlines a lot of those feelings because it's something we've never really had to face before and we don't know how it's going to pan out."" He is using art to help staff and students express their feelings creatively and non-verbally. As a group they are then encouraged to share their work to ""make sense"" of the feelings together. The workshop also tries to find solutions to some of the issues affecting the climate. Dr Bird said the therapy sessions have already proven successful, with some people leaving feeling less anxious and guilty. This has made him want to expand the sessions with other forms of art like drama and dance. After the success of the sessions he has run, he hopes to offer eco-anxiety sessions to all staff and students. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

John Paul II 'set for sainthood' with second miracle,"The Congregation for the Causes of Saints ruled an ""inexplicable recovery"" on 1 May 2011 was due to the late Pope's intercession, Ansa reported. Earlier that same day he had been beatified after a first miracle was attributed to his intervention. Pope Francis must now give his approval before a canonisation date is set. Canonisation is the final step in the official process that declares a deceased person to be a saint. Speedy process At a plenary meeting of the Congregation on Tuesday, cardinals and bishops mooted a canonisation ceremony taking place in December, sources told Ansa. One possible date would be 8 December, on which Catholics celebrate the feast of the Immaculate Conception, which this year falls on a Sunday. John Paul II could be canonised at the same time as John XXIII, Vatican sources suggested. Venerated by Catholics as ""the good pope"", John XXIII was elected in 1958 and convened the Second Vatican Council in 1962, but died the following year before it was finished. Canonisation requires the attribution of one further miracle to the intercession of the candidate after they have been beatified. The Vatican has not revealed details about the second miracle in John Paul II's case. It was reportedly deemed an ""inexplicable recovery"" by a panel of doctors before being approved last month by a board of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints' theologians. John Paul II died in 2005 aged 84 and was beatified by his successor Benedict XVI in May 2011. Among a crowd hundreds of thousands strong on St Peter's Square was French nun Marie Simon-Pierre, who says she was cured of Parkinson's Disease after praying for the intervention of the late pope little more than a month after he died. Some questioned the Church's speed in beatifying John Paul II just six years after his death. Although widely regarded as one of the great popes of modern times, his 26-year pontificate was tarnished by his handling of the clerical sex abuse scandal that has rocked the global Church. Critics say other of the Church's deep-seated problems - such as its dysfunctional management and financial scandals at the Vatican bank - stem from shortcomings of his pontificate. John Paul II reformed the sainthood process in 1983, making it faster, simpler, and cheaper. The office of ""Devil's advocate"" - an official whose job was to try to knock down the case for sainthood - was eliminated, and the required number of miracles was dropped. The idea was to lift up contemporary role models of holiness in order to convince a jaded secular world that sanctity is alive in the here and now, says veteran Vatican analyst John Allen. The result was that John Paul II beatified and canonised more people than all previous popes combined.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chagos Islanders lose court bid,"They were evicted by the UK government from the 1960s to allow the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, the archipelago's largest island. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that as they had already been compensated, the case was inadmissible. The Chagossians said they were ""saddened and shocked"" by the ruling. The case concerns complaints made by 1,786 Chagos Islanders, or their descendants, arising from the evacuation of the British Indian Ocean Territory between 1967 and 1973. The Chagossians took their case to Strasbourg after a long-running legal battle in the UK which ended in 2008, when the Law Lords ruled in favour of the government by a majority of 3-2. 'Definitive' compensation In its final decision, issued on Thursday, the ECHR said: ""The court notably found that the heart of the applicants' claims under the European Convention on Human Rights was the callous and shameful treatment which they or their antecedents had suffered during their removal from the Chagos islands."" However, because the claims had been settled ""definitively"" in domestic courts, the applicants had ""effectively renounced bringing any further claims to determine whether the expulsion and exclusion from their homes had been unlawful and breached their rights"". The first legal proceedings by the Chagossians were settled in 1982 when the UK government agreed to pay £4m and provide land worth £1m. Chagossians and their supporters said they were saddened by the latest court decision. A spokesman for the islanders said: ""We appeal to the coalition government to stand by their pre-election promises to bring about a just and fair settlement to one of the great tragedies of the 20th Century, perpetrated by the UK on the defenceless - the brutal removal of an entire people from their homeland and their way of life, into a life of exile, poverty and hardship."" One supporting body, the Minority Rights Group International, reiterated its call for the UK government to recognise the Chagos islanders' ""fundamental right to go home"". ""Having expelled a whole people from their homes, the United Kingdom government is now washing its hands of all responsibility,"" says MRG executive director Mark Lattimer. However, Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the ruling, which signals the end of a long legal process. ""We have made clear our regret for the wrongs done to the Chagossian people over 40 years ago. Nevertheless, it was right for the government to defend itself against this action. He added that the government would now re-examine its policy of the resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), as previously promised. ""There are fundamental difficulties with resettlement in BIOT, but we will be as positive as possible in our engagement with Chagossian groups and all interested parties.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Derrick Murphy reports Norfolk County Council over recorded call,"Derrick Murphy stood down as leader ahead of a standards committee hearing in February that found he had brought his office into disrepute. The hearing was told chief executive David White had secretly recorded a phone conversation with Mr Murphy. A council spokesman said the authority was surprised to hear of the complaint. The dispute between Mr Murphy, a Conservative, and the authority stems from accusations relating to an email sent to the BBC by a political assistant. 'Internal warfare' The email was alleged to have disparaged Nick Daubney, Conservative leader of West Norfolk Council. Mr Murphy was brought before the county council standards committee meeting which heard of ""internal warfare"" in the local Tory party. He was cleared of various accusations but found to have brought the office of the leader into disrepute and was ordered to undergo ethics training. Mr White had told the hearing he had secretly recorded a conversation with Mr Murphy on 27 April last year, having sought legal advice first. Mr Murphy, councillor for Freebridge Lynn, said he had referred the council to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) over the recorded call, alleging ""possible multiple breaches"" of the Data Protection Act. ""I think the Information Commissioner should investigate this matter as I think it important for the residents of Norfolk to find out whether this practice is widespread within the council and what actions can be taken if possible breaches have occurred,"" he said. 'Not seeking re-election' A spokesman for the ICO said: ""I can confirm that we have received Mr Murphy's complaint and we will be making inquiries in due course."" A Norfolk County Council spokesman said: ""We are surprised to hear this as Councillor Murphy has not made a complaint to the council itself. ""However, the standards committee referred to concluded that Councillor Murphy had brought the county council and the office of leader into disrepute by asking his assistant to lie on his behalf. ""He subsequently stood down from his cabinet post and is not seeking re-election at the forthcoming elections."" Mr White left the council on Friday after announcing his retirement. Last year the council was fined £80,000 by the ICO for sending details about allegations against a parent and the welfare of their child to the wrong person.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
One Direction cancel Belfast concert as Liam Payne falls ill,"They had been due to play the first of three gigs at the SSE Arena on Tuesday. The cancellation announcement was made at about 21:00 BST, when most of the audience was already inside the venue. Disappointed fans booed as staff instructed them to leave the venue and one witness said ""hundreds"" of girls and women had been left weeping. Concert promoter Aiken PR said: ""The show tonight has been cancelled as Liam has taken ill, and whilst not serious, he is unable to perform tonight."" Fans have been asked to hold on to their tickets and wait for further information, with a statement expected on Wednesday morning. In a statement, the band, who are undergoing a final tour before taking their first break next year since forming on X Factor in 2010, apologised to their fans. And on his Twitter account, Harry Styles wrote: ""Deepest apologies to everyone at the show tonight in Belfast. Very disappointed, but unfortunately these things happen. We're very sorry."" Band mate Louis Tomlinson tweeted: ""We're so so sorry for what happened tonight, it was out of our control! Lots of love to Liam and thank you for being so understanding!"" Audience members had already gathered inside the concert venue, and had listened to the band's support act, before the cancellation announcement was made. Some expressed anger at the timing. Michael Green, who took his six-year-old daughter to the show, told the BBC he was ""disgusted"" at how fans had been treated. He described how he had to make his way out of the arena past ""hundreds and hundreds"" of weeping young girls and women. Mr Green, who lives in Coleraine, County Londonderry, said he had spent £140 on two tickets and more on merchandise and food inside the venue. Sarah Stevenson, from Dundonald, outside Belfast, attended the concert with her sister and they had also spent £140 on the ""most expensive"" tickets. She posted a video of the cancellation announcement on her YouTube account, during which fans can been heard booing and heckling. Ms Stevenson said that at first she had thought the cancellation was ""a joke"" and was very disappointed and surprised that the show was called off ""at such short notice"". She said many younger fans had queued at the venue from early morning. The cancelled show was the first of three sold out One Direction concerts booked at the Belfast venue over consecutive nights.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Isle of Wight monolith: Designer claims responsibility for structure,"The pillar, similar to ones in the US and Romania, sparked global headlines after it was found on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. Tom Dunford, who lives on the island, said: ""I did it purely for fun."" The gleaming structure on Compton Beach has been attracting an influx of visitors since its discovery on Sunday. The reflective structure sparked a stir on social media about who put it there and why. Mr Dunford, 29, from Fishbourne, told BBC Radio Solent: ""If the aliens were to come down I think they'd go for the safest place which is the Isle of Wight in tier 1 [Covid restrictions]. ""I was convinced it would be stolen in the first couple of hours."" Mr Dunford, who works for a design company, said: ""When I saw the first one pop up [in Utah] I thought it was brilliant, the second one popped up and I had a text from a friend which said 'you're the man that can do this on the island'. ""I'm absolutely fascinated in futuristic design, science and space. The actual idea sparked when I was walking back to the office and we had an old sheet of mirrored perspex."" Mr Dunford said he told a few trusted friends and relatives about his plan before he drove down to the beach at 04:00 GMT on Sunday to install it. ""I'm one of these guys, once I get a creative streak I have to just go for it,"" he added. But he admitted he did not expect it to get the reaction it did. ""I'm going to leave it and let people take photos and go and collect it in a couple of days,"" he said. The beach is being closely monitored to avoid a deluge of crowds, the National Trust has said. The trust, which is responsible for the site, said rangers would ""ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded"". A metal monolith appeared briefly in the Utah desert late last month. It created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats with two others found in southern California and Romania days later. An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California - it posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (£34,000) price tag. In 2001: A Space Odyssey - the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick - imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke.

Hooded men: Villiers ordered to give sworn statement,"If Theresa Villiers fails to meet next week's deadline, she could be subject to contempt of court proceedings. The group claim they were tortured by the Army in the 1970s and believe the Secretary of State is withholding documents relating to the case. She has denied this accusation, saying the UK government ""takes these issues very seriously"". ""I can provide reassurance that we're going to be disclosing all the documents that are required. ""Obviously with matters of such sensitivity, which date back some decades, it takes a while to do the searches needed to ensure that we've found all the relevant documents and compiled the appropriate affidavit to support them."" The 14 men were arrested at the height of the Troubles under the policy of internment or detention without trial. Surviving members of the group are involved in a judicial review. Torture They are challenging the failure of the police, the secretary of state, and the justice minister to investigate allegations that they were tortured. Eight of the 14 men attended the High Court hearing in Belfast on Friday. The case has been subject to delays after the Northern Ireland Office said it needed more time to examine documents. A barrister acting for the men said reasons given for the delays were ""unacceptable"". The crown's barrister said a ""significant amount of work"" had been undertaken in gathering documents. He told the court 18 days had been spent in the national archives, and four days on looking at papers in the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence. A deadline of 24 March was set for Theresa Villiers to sign off on her affidavit. The court heard she had failed to do so because of her recent trip to the United States. The court also heard that other UK government ministers had been contacted in relation to the case. Speaking outside court, spokesman for the group, Francis McGuigan, said he believed the UK authorities were waiting for the group to die so they would not have to investigate the torture claims. Alzheimer's ""There's four of the lads have died since, one of the lads is in the early stage of Alzheimer's - none of us getting any younger,"" he said. ""We're all well into our 60s now, some of us into our 70s, and we'd like to see a successful conclusion to this case. ""We want it back in court in Europe, we want Europe to re-look at the whole decision they made back in 1978, and come out with the truth."" Liam Shannon, another of the Hooded Men, added: ""Please God, our small triumph for today will echo throughout the rest of the campaign groups."" Asked if he hoped to see justice in his lifetime, Mr Shannon said: ""We hope so. None of us are getting any younger, but we're still actively campaigning, and we will still actively campaign.""

Scottish Book Trust launches search for Scotland's favourite book,"They can choose for a shortlist of 50 books compiled by the Scottish Book Trust. The trust said the shortlist was an attempt to ""reflect the depth and breadth"" of Scottish writing. The 10 most popular books will be announced at the end of Scottish Book Week, which runs from 25 November until 1 December. The shortlist was compiled in collaboration with author and literary critic Stuart Kelly, who admitted some of his choices were likely to prove controversial. Mr Kelly said: ""Choosing only fifty books from the last fifty years - half a century which has seen major innovations and developments in the Scottish novel - was never going to be uncontroversial. ""I am grateful to colleagues at Scottish Book Trust for their assistance in compiling this list, which, I think, combines the well known with the idiosyncratic, the famous and the unjustly forgotten and which will hopefully help readers discover new possible favourites and revisit existing ones."" 'National conversation' Titles to choose from include modern favourites such as Iain Banks' The Bridge, Ali Smith's Hotel World and Christopher Brookmyre's One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night. Also up for nomination is Kate Atkinson's recent novel Life after Life, which was shortlisted for the Bailey's Women's Prize for Fiction earlier this year. Crime fiction, one of Scotland's best loved genres, is well represented, with Denise Mina's Garnet Hill and The Cutting Room by Louise Welsh both making the shortlist, as well as Ian Rankin's groundbreaking Black and Blue. Boasting noteworthy Scottish voices from the past and present, the list includes contributions from those who have become internationally renowned such as Alexander McCall Smith, Irvine Welsh, Muriel Spark and Alasdair Gray. Books which are perhaps lesser known have also been given the chance to be re-discovered by new readers, with the inclusion of novels such as Amande's Bed by John Aberdein and Swing Hammer Swing! by Jeff Torrington. Marc Lambert, Chief Executive of Scottish Book Trust, said: ""Book Week Scotland is a fantastic opportunity for a national conversation about books. ""What we are keen to find out, from the public discussion and voting this list stimulates, is whether the authors who are old favourites - Alasdair Gray, Muriel Spark - will stay the course, or whether other more recent writers have come to resonate more strongly with Scottish readers.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Woman's rape claim against conductor Michael Brewer 'fantasy',"Michael Brewer, now 67, is accused of carrying out the offences at Manchester's Chetham's School and his home, between 1978 and 1982. Kate Blackwell QC, defending, said the woman had told Manchester Crown Court ""a complete pack of lies"". Mr Brewer from Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and indecent assault. His ex-wife, Hilary Brewer, 67, from Rossendale, Lancashire, is also on trial and denies aiding and abetting rape and indecent assault. The woman has previously claimed that Mr Brewer, now of Swarthmore Road, began a relationship with her when she was 14, and that ""intensified"" into intimate touching and full sex. She said he had abused her at his former home in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, while his ex-wife and children slept upstairs. Miss Blackwell, representing Mr Brewer, said the woman's claims were fantasy. The woman replied that she was ""not in the realms of fantasy and I really understand why so many cases do not come to court"". She went on to allege she was subjected to a rape at the house when she was 18, and that Mrs Brewer indecently assaulted her. 'Utter fantasy' The jury was told that following the alleged rape, the three slept in the same bed overnight before Mr Brewer took the woman to the railway station. Miss Blackwell said this scenario was ""utter fantasy"" and that the woman had ""told this jury a complete pack of lies about the visit to this house"". ""You spent the night lying next to two of your rapists?"" she asked. The woman answered that the incident had happened, but that she ""felt guilty [and] did not know how to get out of it"". ""This is a lie, you could have left the house at any time,"" said Miss Blackwell. ""You have clearly no feminine understanding of what someone goes through like that, what shock your body goes through, how you almost feel you deserve it,"" said the woman. Mr Brewer, who was awarded an OBE, went on to become the artistic director of the National Youth Choirs of Britain, directed the World Youth Choir and also worked on the BBC's Last Choir Standing programme.

Colin Davidson's painting of Angela Merkel makes cover of Time magazine,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Arts Correspondent Ms Merkel has been named the magazine's 'Person of the Year' and Davidson's portrait adorns the cover of the world-famous publication. He did not meet her in person but took inspiration from photos and footage. The Belfast-born artist told the BBC that the invitation from Time was ""something you don't turn down"". ""I'm sitting in my studio looking at the actual painting, and to see it reproduced on the cover of Time at this time of year and online worldwide is a remarkable thing,"" he said. The artist, whose striking portraits can currently be seen in Belfast's Lyric theatre and in the Ulster Museum among many other places, said he was initially a little worried as it was not possible to get a sitting with Ms Merkel. ""All of my paintings, to date, have been the result of meeting and spending time with the person I've painted. ""With this particular commission I was told that the likeness was going to have to be gained through photographic source. ""But I decided to rise to the challenge."" Davidson immersed himself in finding out about his subject, studying photographs and film and reading books about Ms Merkel. 'Empathy and compassion' The process took about six weeks from start to finish, whereas he usually works on a portrait for about six months. ""I love nothing more than sitting in my studio and making work, so I just had to focus completely. ""I always paint my sitters in a very natural light. So I actually had to go back into my archive of personal sitters and look at how the light worked on their faces, so I used lots of my own sources from my studio as well as photographic sources for the portrait."" Davidson said that while he did not actually meet Ms Merkel, he felt that by painting her, he did get to know her. ""What I wanted to bring out was something that photography has never caught: a sense of compassion, dignity and humanity. ""I'm thinking particularly of her stance this year."" ""What I wanted to do was to portray that, so that whenever people looked at her face and looked into her eyes in the portrait a sense of empathy and compassion would come through."" He found out on Wednesday afternoon that his portrait was on the cover of Time, being seen by people right across the world. Mrs Merkel has not yet been in contact with the artist, but he said he would ""jump at"" an opportunity to meet the chancellor.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vietnam accuses China in seas dispute,"A rare weekend news briefing followed a confrontation in the South China Sea between a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship and Chinese patrol boats. Vietnam says the boats deliberately cut the survey ship's cables in Vietnamese waters. China denies the allegation. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim territories in the South China Sea. The area includes an important shipping route and is also thought to contain oil and gas deposits. The spat comes just days before a regional security conference in Singapore. Beijing said its defence minister would attend the IISS Asia Security Summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, to promote co-operation and stability in the Asia Pacific region. 'High speed' The latest clash involving Chinese patrol boats occurred 120km (80 miles) off the south-central coast of Vietnam and some 600km south of China's Hainan island. ""The Vietnamese navy will do everything necessary to firmly protect peace and the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Vietnam,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said. One of three Chinese patrol vessels on the scene intentionally cut a submerged cable towed by the ship, the Binh Minh 02, said Do Van Hau, deputy chief executive of state oil and gas group PetroVietnam, which was operating the ship. ""Chinese vessels were at very high speed and did not respond to our ship's warning and then cut the cables of the Binh Minh 02, about 2km from where it was positioned,"" he said. China's foreign ministry blamed Vietnam for the incident, saying its oil and gas operations ""undermined China's interests and jurisdictional rights"". China's claim in the South China Sea is by far the largest, and includes the Spratly and Paracel archipelagos. Taiwan recently said it would improve the defence capability of more than 100 coastguard troops stationed in a disputed area of the South China Sea. Taiwan's decision was announced shortly after the Philippines increased the pressure recently by lodging a protest at the United Nations against China's claims to the area. Last year, China sharply rebuked US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she said the US supported the freedom of navigation in the area and offered to facilitate multilateral talks on the disputes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Duke and Duchess of Sussex: Harry and Meghan arrive in Morocco,"The royal couple's three-day trip is aimed at strengthening the UK's links with Morocco - which is one of the few stable countries in the region. Their visit will also focus on gender equality, with the pair discussing Morocco's attitudes towards women with British ambassador Thomas Reilly. Mr Reilly said the issue is ""close to their royal highnesses' hearts"". Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan, 37, touched down in Casablanca airport on Saturday evening, although flight delays meant they were two hours late for their welcoming ceremony. They entered the airport's royal suite where they were offered the traditional welcome of milk and dates. Black limousines then took the duke and duchess - plus their entourage of nine, including a hairdresser - to meet Morocco's Crown Prince Moulay Hassan. The couple are staying with Morocco's King Mohammed VI at a royal residence. During their visit to Morocco - which will be an important market for the UK after Brexit - the pair will visit the famous Atlas Mountains and the country's capital, Rabat. They will see a girls' education project, meet young social entrepreneurs and visit programmes working with children with disabilities and those with mental health problems. Britain's ambassador to Morocco, Mr Reilly, said: ""I'm really excited to showcase the vital roles that girls' education and youth employment are playing in shaping modern Morocco. ""When we began planning for this visit, I had a very clear view in my mind of the story we wanted this visit to tell. It's the same story we've been telling consistently at this embassy for the last 20 months since my arrival here. ""This official visit by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will highlight Morocco's focus on women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and the encouragement of social entrepreneurship."" A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the duke and duchess were ""very much looking forward to the visit"" and were ""particularly pleased"" they will be able to meet so many young Moroccans. Last year, the royal couple took their first official tour as a married couple with a 16-day royal trip around Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Meghan is heavily pregnant with the couple's first child. They announced the pregnancy in October last year.

"Ceredigion council flood costs 'problematic', says deputy leader","Dozens of families around Aberystwyth are still unable to return to their homes after June's flash floods. A month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours and 1,000 people had to leave their homes. A senior councillor said the authority was dealing with a £20m highways repair backlog caused by severe winters before the floods hit. Ceredigion council spent £300,000 clearing up in the immediate aftermath of the flood, fixing roads and bridges. However, it expects repair costs will rise to over £400,000. The figures come as the Local Government Association, which represents more than 370 councils across England and Wales, says the summer's floods have left councils facing multi-million pound repair bills. Councillor Ray Quant, Ceredigion deputy council leader, said: ""The floods obviously exasperates previous situations where we had a £20m backlog on our highways infrastructure mainly caused by severe winters - not last winter - the two winters before. ""And now we have got the flood damage coming on top of that so it will be problematic for us,"" he said. Aberystwyth and the nearby villages of Talybont, Dol-y-Bont, Capel Bangor, Llanbadarn Fawr and Llandre were among the areas affected by the heavy rain which fell between 8 and 9 June. In the days after, some families driven from their homes by the water were warned they would have to leave for up to six months. A total of £105,000 has been collected through the council leader's appeal fund and 130 people affected by the floods will receive a payment of £700 or £250 to help with some of their costs. Michael Fothergill from Talybont whose home was hit by flooding, praised the help of the council but said he was still waiting for answers about why the flooding happened. ""We haven't had a full explanation to what happened on the day, any events that contributed to the flood, and what we can do to help mitigate a flood in the future."" Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn, who also lives in Talybont, said an initial expert report suggested that the event was a one in 200-year flood. ""Water came down from the mountain in one huge rush,"" she told BBC Radio Wales, adding that she did not believe it could have been prevented.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BA pilots vote in favour of strike action over key summer period,"The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said 93% of its members had voted in favour of industrial action. A strike would be likely to cause severe disruption, as Balpa represents about 90% of the airline's pilots. BA said it was ""very disappointed"" with the decision, and is seeking an injunction to halt potential strikes. The union said it did not yet have any dates for a potential strike, adding it still hoped that the dispute could be resolved. British Airways said it remained open to working with the union to reach an agreement and continued to ""pursue every avenue to find a solution to protect our customers' travel plans and avoid industrial action"". Pilots have rejected a pay increase worth 11.5% over three years, which the airline says is ""fair and generous"". However, Balpa argues that its members deserve a better offer, as BA has been making healthy profits. The vote in favour of action comes after three days of negotiations between the airline and pilots' union with conciliation service Acas. Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said the strong result in favour of action showed ""the resolve of BA pilots"" and said BA ""must table a sensible improved offer if a strike is to be averted"". ""We do not wish to inconvenience our customers, which is why we have tried to resolve this matter through negotiation starting last November. It is BA who has regrettably chosen to drag this out into the summer months,"" he added. High Court injunction British Airways is seeking an injunction on Tuesday in the High Court to halt any potential strike action. The union would have to give British Airways a minimum of two weeks' notice of any action, meaning the earliest any action could could take place is 6 August. Balpa said the High Court hearing meant any further negotiations ""are on hold while we prepare to defend our right to take this action"". The union argues that the the cost to BA to settle the dispute in full is ""significantly less than the cost would be of even a single day's strike action"". ""We currently do not have dates for any potential strike action and will issue an update on this in due course. We remain hopeful that this dispute can be resolved before strike action, but we remain committed to action if necessary,"" added Mr Strutton. Rising profits British Airways is part of International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia. Last year, it reported a pre-tax profit of €3bn, up almost 9.8% on the previous year. British Airways contributed £1.96bn to that, up 8.7% on 2017.

May seeks 'new chapter' in Gulf relations ahead of Bahrain visit,"She will be the first UK prime minister and female politician to attend the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday he had repeatedly expressed concerns to his Saudi Arabian counterpart about its involvement in the Yemeni civil war amid allegations that civilians had been targeted during bombing campaigns against Houthi rebels fighting the government. But he said he did not believe a ""threshold has been crossed"" requiring the suspension of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Mrs May will meet young people in Bahrain to discuss progress on political and social reforms since the widespread unrest in the Gulf nation in 2011, which prompted a much-criticised crackdown by the authorities. ""No doubt there will be some people in the UK who say we shouldn't seek stronger trade and security ties with these countries because of their record on human rights,"" she said. ""[But] we achieve far more by stepping up, engaging with these countries and working with them to encourage and support their plans for reform. ""That is how Britain can be a force for good in the world as well as helping to keep our people safe and create new opportunities for business."" The government says it has identified £30bn of high-value opportunities for British businesses across 15 different sectors in the region over the next five years.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jon Snow and Nigel Farage cleared by Ofcom over Brexit rally remarks,"Snow didn't break rules by saying he had ""never seen so many white people in one place"", the media watchdog decided. Ofcom also investigated Nigel Farage's comment on his LBC radio show two days later that Snow ""should be attacked"". Seven people complained, but the Brexit Party leader was cleared because he added that he meant a verbal attack. Snow's original comments came at the end of of Channel 4 News on 29 March as he reflected on protests in Westminster on the day the UK was originally meant to have left the European Union. ""It has been the most extraordinary day... I've never seen so many white people in one place. It's an extraordinary story,"" he told viewers. Channel Four described the comment as ""a spontaneous, unscripted observation"". Ofcom said the remark ""was ambiguous in its meaning and touched on a clearly sensitive issue"" and ""had the potential to cause offence"". However, the broadcasting regulator also noted that the programme included discussions with people with a wide range of views; that the programme was live; and that the crowd did appear to be ""predominantly white"". Any offence was ""sufficiently contextualised"", Ofcom ruled. Two days later, Mr Farage had a heated discussion with former Labour Party spin doctor Alistair Campbell on LBC about the march. Mr Campbell said protesters ""started beating up journalists"" and asked the host to condemn ""people who attack journalists, like Trump does"". Mr Farage said: ""Well I think Jon Snow should be attacked without doubt, but that's slightly a separate issue."" Asked why, he replied: ""Because of his terrible condescending bias, but that's a separate issue."" 'Verbally attacked' Ofcom said his comments ""had the clear potential to be interpreted by the audience as a reference to the use of physical violence against Jon Snow"". But it noted that, four minutes later, Mr Farage read out a tweet accusing him of inciting violence and then gave his response. ""No! Verbally. Verbally attacked for his disgraceful coverage of the Leave rally on Friday,"" he told listeners. LBC pointed out that during the discussion, Mr Farage had condemned people who physically attacked journalists, and had spoken about his desire for people to have ""peaceful and democratic means of expressing their anger"". Therefore, sufficient context was given, and Mr Farage did not break the Ofcom broadcasting code, the regulator decided. Ofcom did, however, warn broadcasters that ""particular care"" is needed when making statements that could be taken as being ""highly inflammatory and provocative"", given the ""current volatile public discourse surrounding Brexit"".

Nintendo posts larger than expected loss despite Mario Kart,"The Japanese company posted a 9.9bn yen ($97m; £57m) deficit for the April-to-June months, compared with an 8.6bn yen profit for the same period a year earlier. Sales were 8% lower, despite the release of a Mario Kart game in May - one of its most popular franchises. The firm did not alter its prediction of a return to full-year profit. It sank to a loss in its last financial year. Nintendo said it expected the release of key titles over the coming months to boost demand before the critical Christmas shopping season. These include new Super Smash Bros fighting games for its Wii U and 3DS consoles, as well as the action title Hyrule Warriors for the living-room machine and two Pokemon monster-collecting remakes for the handheld device. Nintendo won praise for the innovative titles it showcased at the recent E3 video games expo in Los Angeles, where it unveiled a new open-world Legends of Zelda title and the paintball arena shooter Splatoon, both due to be released in 2015. But one analyst suggested the releases would come too late. ""They have a relatively good games pipeline, but the big question is about its hardware,"" said Ed Barton, a games industry analyst at the Ovum consultancy. ""The Wii U is so far behind now, and the perception of the audience that it's a relatively under-powered console compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is now pretty firmly cemented. ""Given how inaccurate some of Nintendo's forecasts have been going into their results in terms of hardware and software sales in the past, I'm not optimistic."" Nintendo originally forecast it would sell nine million Wii Us in its last financial year. In May it revealed it had sold only about 2.7 million units despite a price cut. A further 510,000 Wii Us were sold over the most recent quarter, taking the total tally since its 2012 launch to 6.7 million consoles sold. Declining reserves Nintendo did not host a conference call following the earnings release, as it normally does, meaning analysts were unable to quiz executives about the progress of previously announced plans to establish a health division and release new devices for emerging markets. Its president, Satoru Iwata, had previously cancelled appearances at E3 and the firm's annual shareholders' meeting after doctors found a ""growth"" in his bile duct, requiring him to have surgery. He wrote a letter late last month saying he had resumed work ""by email and by other means"" but was not yet ready to return to his regular schedule. Documents posted online do, however, offer a couple of other insights: The news was released after the close of the Japanese markets, but Nintendo stock traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange had fallen about 6% from its opening price by early afternoon.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
USS John S McCain: Navy sacks officers over collision,"Cmdr Alfredo J Sanchez, the commanding officer, and Cmdr Jessie L Sanchez, the executive officer, were sacked due to a ""loss of confidence"", the Navy said. The USS John S McCain was east of Singapore when it collided with the oil tanker Alnic MC on 21 August. The collision was the fourth such incident in a year. ""While the investigation is ongoing, it is evident the collision was preventable,"" a statement from the Navy said on Wednesday. ""The commanding officer exercised poor judgment, and the executive officer exercised poor leadership of the ship's training program."" The collision left a large hole in the destroyer's port side - the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward - and flooded compartments including crew berths. Five sailors were injured while 10 others were killed. The Alnic MC sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills. The Navy said the destroyer experienced a loss of steering control before the incident but it is unclear if that led to the crash. In the aftermath of the collision, Vice Adm Joseph P Aucoin was dismissed as commander of the Seventh Fleet. The Seventh Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan, is the largest forward-­deployed fleet in the US Navy, with some 50 to 70 vessels and submarines. The incident also triggered a rare worldwide ""operational pause"" of the US Navy's fleets as well as a review of operations. Cmdr Alfredo J Sanchez was re-assigned to Commander, Naval Forces Japan, while Cmdr Jessie L Sanchez was sent to Ship Repair Facility in Yokosuka. Previous collisions The incident marked the fourth time this year that a US Navy vessel has been involved in an accident in Asia. Two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka. Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision tore a gash under the warship's waterline. In May, a guided missile cruiser collided with a South Korean fishing vessel, while in January another cruiser ran aground near the fleet base in Yokosuka.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: German zoo may have to feed animals to each other,"A zoo director in northern Germany has even admitted that some animals might soon have to be fed to others, if the zoo is to survive. ""We've listed the animals we'll have to slaughter first,"" Neumünster Zoo's Verena Kaspari told Die Welt. Berlin Zoo has infant panda twins, but their fans can only watch them online. The zoo's spokeswoman Philine Hachmeister told DPA news agency ""the panda twins are adorably sweet"". ""Constantly we're thinking 'the visitors should be watching them live'. We don't want the little pandas to be grown up by the time we finally reopen."" Big appetites Ms Kaspari at Neumünster Zoo said killing some animals so that others could live would be a last resort, and ""unpleasant"", but even that would not solve the financial problem. The seals and penguins needed big quantities of fresh fish daily, she pointed out. ""If it comes to it, I'll have to euthanise animals, rather than let them starve,"" she said. ""At the worst, we would have to feed some of the animals to others."" Ms Kaspari's zoo belongs to an association, which is not covered by the state emergency fund for small businesses. She estimates the zoo's loss of income this spring will be about €175,000 (£152,400). Besides direct appeals for public donations, Germany's zoos are jointly requesting government aid worth €100m, DPA reports. Germany's national zoo association (VdZ) argues that zoos, unlike many other businesses, cannot go into hibernation and run down costs. Animals still have to be fed daily and looked after, while a tropical enclosure has to be heated above 20C. VdZ chief Jörg Junhold said the lockdown was costing a typical German zoo about €500,000 weekly in lost turnover. Schönbrunn Zoo, one of Vienna's top attractions, says it can manage for the time-being by drawing on existing savings. But on 1 April it sent 70% of its 230 staff on three months' furlough - sent home with their jobs safeguarded. Austria has a ""Kurzarbeit"" (subsidised short-time work) system like Germany's, so that most workers do not lose their jobs when their employer hits hard times. Animals 'missing humans' Some zookeepers have also warned that the crisis has an emotional cost for certain animals, because they miss the attention they would usually get from the public. Ms Hachmeister at Berlin Zoo said ""the apes especially love to watch people"". She said seals and parrots were also fascinated by their visitors, and ""for them now it's really pretty boring"". Last week Moscow Zoo also said its two giant pandas were ""missing something now"". ""They've started to much more actively approach every single person who walks past their enclosure,"" it said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kevin Bennett killing: Three boys guilty of murder,"Kevin Bennett, 53, was attacked near the Iceland supermarket in Walton Road, Liverpool, about 05:30 BST on 17 August. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries but died six days later. The boys, two aged 14 and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denied murdering Mr Bennett. Linda Doran, 42, of Teulon Close, Liverpool, was also convicted of perverting the course of public justice by providing false alibis for two defendants. Goaded younger boy All four were remanded in custody for sentencing in the week commencing 15 April. Trial judge, Recorder Clement Goldstone QC, ordered psychiatric and psychological assessments of the boys to be carried out. Earlier in the trial the jury was told the 17-year-old had goaded one of the 14-year-olds by saying: ""I bet you haven't got it in you to do him in."" The court heard the younger boy later told his friend: ""I started kicking him, I booted him and now he's dead."" The second 14-year-old stood look-out as the attack took place, the prosecution said. Mr Bennett, described as ""vulnerable"" by the prosecution, suffered a fractured eye socket, a collapsed lung and a broken ribcage. He died in hospital from blood poisoning after an infection set in, causing organ failure, a post-mortem examination found. Jailed for photographs The court was told how Mr Bennett had been in the pub from 11:00 BST on 16 August and had consumed between 10 and 12 cans of lager. He left just after midnight with more beer in a carrier bag and settled down for the night behind the Iceland store. He was discovered, injured, by Iceland staff arriving for work at 07:00 BST the next day. Speaking outside court, Mr Bennett's cousin Angela Connerty, 49, said: ""Kevin was a loving person who would do anything for anyone - nothing was ever trouble to him. ""We hope nobody else's family have to go through what we have gone through and we are now pleased we have got justice."" During the trial Doran's son, Jordan, 21, was held in contempt of court by Recorder Goldstone after being caught using a mobile phone to take photographs in the courtroom. He was jailed for six months on 8 February but legal restrictions banned reporting of this until the end of the trial.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mitsubishi Motors shares untraded in Japan due to sell orders,"Right up till the close of Thursday's session, shares were not able to trade as there were about 10 times as many sell orders as there were bids. According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the latest share price was indicated at 583 yen ($5.34; £3.74) a share. That is a 20% plunge from the previous day close of 733 yen. Shares tanked by more than 15% on Wednesday. That was as news emerged that Mitsubishi Motors had admitted falsifying fuel economy data for more than 600,000 vehicles sold in Japan. Officials have raided an office of Mitsubishi motors, and authorities are demanding a full report from the company, due on April 27th. In the broader Japanese market, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 2.7% - or 457.08 points - to close at 17,363.62. That is the highest level since 3 February. ""In a lot of respects I think yesterday's selling of Mitsubishi was a bit overdone,"" said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading. ""From what we know so far it's all very domestic, with no US impact and no impact in Europe, and I think people are a bit hasty to cast this in the same light as the Volkswagen scandal. But of course the facts aren't all in yet, so it's hard to know for sure.""

"Llangattock hydro power plan raises £270,000 in share offer","By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent A total of 100 people have come forward in Llangattock, Powys, and the share offer has closed early. Power will be generated from streams with profits being ploughed put back into the village. It was crowned the UK's greenest community in 2009 in a competition. Llangattock won £100,000 to be used to make the village carbon-negative and decided to try to develop hydro power schemes. Villagers set up Llangattock Green Valleys as a co-operative business. The share offer only opened two months ago but has reached its target with people buying shares of between £250 and £20,000. It will fund the construction of two micro hydro schemes - Cwm Gu, near Crickhowell, and Llwmws Farm, Hillside, Llangattock. Investors have been offered interest payments of 5% a year with profits going into a fund to finance other projects in the community. And it is claimed that could be worth about £500,000 over 20 years. 'Sense of achievement' The co-operative said planning applications and abstraction licences had been drawn up to move the planned projects to their next phase. ""These streams have been running for centuries and more,"" said investor and local vet Rob Smith. ""The technology is simple. There isn't much that is going to go wrong with it. It seemed to me to be a good idea to invest."" Llangattock Green Valleys project won the Welsh final of the British Gas challenge in 2009 and went on to win the British title in the Green Streets competition. Back then solar panels and 100 radiator panels were installed at the school with an air source heat pump added to the hall. Meanwhile 43 homes in Llangattock installed 655 energy efficiency measures including insulation, solar panels, a biomass boiler and multi-fuel stoves. One of the planned new hydro turbines will be in a stream on a farm run by George Smith, who said: ""Anything that will enable us to put more in the community and develop more environmentally-friendly energy schemes is good as far as I'm concerned."" The project website said full feasibility studies had been completed, with legal agreements in place with landowners. ""To see people putting money into the co-operative is a sense of achievement,"" said Michael Butterfield, one of the co-operative's five directors.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour's Kate Osamor resigns as shadow minister,"It comes weeks after she was reported to Parliament's standards watchdog. Earlier in the year, the Edmonton MP's son, Ishmael - then a Haringey councillor - was convicted of having £2,500-worth of drugs at a festival. The Times newspaper says its reporter was visiting her home to ask questions about the case. Her resignation follows allegations of misconduct made by the newspaper, which says she verbally abused its reporter on Friday night before throwing water over him, then calling the police. The reporter had visited the MP's home seeking a response to ongoing questions surrounding Ms Osamor's son's conviction for drug offences, the newspaper said. In a statement on Twitter, the Edmonton MP said it had been a ""difficult time"". Ishmael Osamor pleaded guilty in September to four charges of drug possession at the Bestival festival in Dorset, but prosecutors accepted he wasn't planning to sell the drugs. According to The Times, Ms Osamor, who was Labour's shadow secretary of state for international development, said she did not know about the case until after sentencing in October. But the newspaper reports that the MP wrote a letter to the trial judge asking for leniency and stressing her son's remorse. The BBC has approached Ms Osamor for comment on the allegations made by the newspaper. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn thanked Ms Osamor, who was elected in 2015, for bringing ""a new dimension"" to her role as a shadow minister ""by committing Labour to tackling global inequality as well as poverty"". Dan Carden, MP for Liverpool Walton, has been appointed acting shadow secretary of state for international development. Ms Osamor's ""integrity"" was questioned when she continued to employ her son as a communications officer after he resigned as a local councillor. Last month a Tory MP reported her to Parliament's standards watchdog over her son's continued employment in her Westminster office as a researcher. Ishmael Osamor was caught trying to take ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and cannabis into the festival in August 2017 - nine months before he was elected as a councillor for Haringey. Following his conviction he resigned from his cabinet post on the council, and later resigned as a councillor following pressure from opposition groups.

Gene therapy 'treats' Parkinson's disease,"By James GallagherHealth reporter, BBC News The illness causes uncontrolled shaking, stiffness and slow movement as part of the brain dies. The small study in The Lancet Neurology used a virus to add genes to brain cells, which resulted in reduced symptoms for half of patients. Parkinson's UK welcomed the study, but said further research was needed. The disease affects 120,000 people in the UK, mostly in the over-50s. There is no cure, although drugs and deep brain stimulation have been shown to reduce symptoms. Gene treatment Patients with Parkinson's have reduced levels of a chemical - GABA - in part of the brain known as the subthalamic nucleus. The researchers created a virus which ""infects"" cells with a gene to increase GABA production. In the trial, 22 patients had the virus injected into their brains while 23 patients had ""sham surgery"", to make them think they had the virus injected. Their motor function was then scored over six months. Patients who had gene therapy showed a 23.1% improvement in their motor score, those with sham surgery improved by 12.7%. The report's authors say this ""offers a novel alternative to conventional pharmacological or surgical treatment"" and that it ""shows the promise of gene therapy for other neurological disorders."" Professor Nicholas Mazarakis, who is a specialist in gene therapy at Imperial College London, told the BBC that the positive result was ""very encouraging."" He added: ""This result should be taken with some caution though, as it constitutes a rather small mean improvement, only 10.4%, in the clinical rating scale motor scores between those patients receiving the gene therapy and the placebo group."" In addition the absence of significant improvements in other secondary outcome measures such as dyskinesia and quality of life between the two groups, warrants further long-term evaluation of this treatment in more patients."" There have been concerns about the safety of gene therapy. In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger died during a trial in the US and there were cases of leukaemia after treatment in France. The authors say this procedure is safe. Dr Michelle Gardner, research development manager at Parkinson's UK, said: ""This research shows the promise of gene therapy for neurological conditions like Parkinson's, but further research is still needed. ""We still don't know for how long the benefits of this treatment may last, or whether there may be long-term problems due to introducing viruses into the brain. ""In addition, any new treatment must be shown to be more effective than those currently available for Parkinson's, which this treatment has not yet been shown to do.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Don't weep for old economic targets,"By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics, BBC News When I started reporting business news in the mid-1990s it was quite a big deal - it's a measure of the amount of money going round particular parts of the economy. It is still measured by the Bank of England, but hardly anybody cares any more because we no longer target money supply. So you probably shouldn't shed any tears at the news that the claimant count, which is a measure of the number of people claiming unemployment benefits, has lost its designation as a National Statistic. The change was made because the introduction of universal credit is making it harder to count. Wednesday's unemployment figures were the first to have an experimental measure that included universal credit. The downgrading of the statistics did not stop Chancellor George Osborne quoting the figures widely. Standing in for David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions, he repeatedly quoted claimant count figures starting with those for Lewisham, which he mentioned in his first reply. Designation of official statistics as National Statistics is supposed to show that: ""the statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value"". The claimant count used to be the headline measure of unemployment in the UK, but there was some criticism of it as a measure, because it could be influenced by government decisions about who was entitled to claim unemployment benefit and whether they could be moved to other benefits such as incapacity benefits instead. As a result, in 1998 the headline figure became the one based on the Labour Force Survey, which follows the guidelines of the International Labour Organisation. The headline unemployment figure is generally higher than the claimant count because it includes some people who are looking for work but not eligible for benefits such as students looking for vacation work or people who are only looking for part-time work. What about the Retail Prices Index? It used to be our headline measure of inflation, but it was replaced with the Consumer Prices Index and two years ago it was decided that it too was not good enough to carry the National Statistics designation. We probably shouldn't get emotionally attached to different economic measures. And there are good reasons for changing the way we measure things. In the case of the claimant count, eventually, everybody who is unemployed and claiming benefits will be receiving universal credit. But calculations become more difficult, because not everybody claiming universal credit will be unemployed. Also, some people are included in the new, experimental claimant count who receive universal credit but are not required to seek work, such as some disabled people, who would not previously have been part of the claimant count. So we move on, and maybe in 20 years nobody will know what the CPI was, or why we used to follow it so closely.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Niger country profile,"Niger fell victim to a series of coups and political instability following its independence from France in 1960. Today the country struggles in the face of frequent droughts, insurgency and wide-spread poverty. Niger is betting on increased oil exploration and gold mining to help modernize its economy. But basic rights issues, such as slavery - which was only banned in 2003 and still remains a problem - and a high rate of illiteracy and disease, remain stubborn challenges. The US has a significant military presence in the country, intended to combat Islamist militants. Niger has become noted as a major transit route for migrants heading to Europe.

"Wales is 'better off' in EU, say the Liberal Democrats","The party currently has no Welsh MEPs, and polls suggest it faces a challenge securing one of the four seats available on 22 May. Much of the campaign is centred around Britain's membership of the EU. The Lib Dems are traditionally pro-European, and say one Welsh job in every 10 depends on trade with the EU. In the last European elections, in 2009, the party came fifth in Wales, with just under 11% of the vote, and the Conservatives, Labour, Plaid Cymru and UKIP won a seat each. Speaking on a visit to Aryma, a craft and design company in Llandrindod Wells, Alec Dauncey, the party's lead candidate, said: ""Other than UKIP, no-one knows what the other parties stand for. ""For those that want to protect Welsh jobs, then they should be looking to vote Liberal Democrat."" He said UKIP's plan to take the UK out of the EU would be ""catastrophic"" and leave Wales and Britain ""alone and diminished in the world"". ""We can only tackle the world's big issues by remaining in Europe,"" he said. ""As members of the European Union our police can work with their counterparts abroad to crack down on the criminals who cross our borders. ""Collectively, our governments can be much bolder in the fight against climate change too,"" he added. 'World-class' Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said the Lib Dems were the only party of 'In', the only one fully committed to continued EU membership. She said: ""The message is clear: are you 'In or Out'? ""For the Welsh Liberal Democrats the answer is clear: Britain and Wales are better in Europe. We are Britain's only party of 'In'. ""It would be a disaster for our economy and for Welsh jobs if we left the EU. ""More than one in ten Welsh jobs depend on trade with EU, why on earth would we want to risk people's livelihoods?""

"Swiss immigration: 50.3% back quotas, final results show","Final results showed 50.3% voted in favour. The vote invalidates the Swiss-EU agreement on freedom of movement. Fiercely independent Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but has adopted large sections of EU policy. Brussels said it regretted the outcome of the vote and would examine its implications. A Yes vote of more than 50% was needed for the referendum to pass. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the vote has shown up traditional divisions, with French-speaking areas against the quotas, German-speaking regions divided, and the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino firmly in favour. A Yes vote means Swiss ministers will have some tricky explaining to do in Brussels, our correspondent says. 'Huge mistake' In a statement, the European Commission said it regretted that an ""initiative for the introduction of quantitative limits to immigration has been passed by this vote. ""This goes against the principle of free movement of persons between the EU and Switzerland. The EU will examine the implications of this initiative on EU-Swiss relations as a whole. In this context, the Federal Council's position on the result will also be taken into account."" The vote comes amid increasing debate across Europe about migration and the impact of free movement of people. Switzerland's economy is booming at the moment, and unemployment is low, but many Swiss worry about immigration. A quarter of the eight million-strong population is foreign, and last year 80,000 new immigrants arrived. Since 2007, most of the EU's 500 million residents have been on an equal footing with locals in the Swiss job market - the result of a policy voted into law in a 2000 referendum. But a coalition led by the right-wing Swiss People's Party now wants to reverse this deal, saying it was a huge mistake. Supporters of quotas believe free movement has put pressure on housing, health, education, and transport. They also argue that foreign workers drive salaries down. But the Swiss government and business leaders say free movement is key to Switzerland's economic success, allowing employers to choose skilled staff from across Europe. Switzerland's bilateral agreements with the EU took years of negotiation to achieve. Our correspondent says that abandoning free movement could limit Switzerland's access to Europe's single market, where over half its exports are sold.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australian man found after two weeks stranded in outback,"Phu Tran, 40, was discovered on Tuesday on a remote farm in the Northern Territory (NT), police said. Mr Tran was part of a trio who became stranded when their car got stuck in a riverbed on 19 November. They later split up to find help. Tamra McBeath-Riley, 52, was found on Sunday, but her partner, 46-year-old Claire Hockridge, remains missing. Mr Tran was found by a farmer who was performing checks on the vast property - known locally as a station - about 160km (100 miles) south of the town of Alice Springs, NT Police said. He had survived by finding groundwater and would be treated for heat exposure in hospital, they added. ""If you believe in miracles, I'm saying it's a miracle,"" Supt Pauline Vicary said. Limited supplies The group and Ms McBeath-Riley's dog, Raya, had been travelling from Alice Springs to go on a hike when they became bogged in the Hugh River. Ms McBeath-Riley said the group had stayed by the car for around three days in an attempt to free it. ""We tried many times to try to get out, but just couldn't get out, the river was just too large,"" she told reporters outside hospital on Monday. ""During the day it's just really hot so we dug ourselves under the car. At night [we] could sleep in the car."" They used up all their supplies of water, as well as some vodka drinks, biscuits and beef noodles they had in the car. They eventually found a watering hole, and boiled the ""quite dirty"" water before sieving it through a shirt, police said. The group eventually decided to split up to get help. Mr Tran and Ms Hockridge planned to head towards a highway, while Ms McBeath-Riley stayed in the area, thinking her dog would not survive a long walk. Following fence to safety Police despatched helicopters to search for the trio. They spotted Ms McBeath-Riley about 1.5km (0.9 miles) away from the car area after a local resident reported seeing tyre tracks. Mr Tran was discovered about 12km from the vehicle, two days after he and Ms Hockridge had separated after finding the station's fence. ""He decided to follow the fence line, and he left her there,"" Supt Vicary was quoting as saying by the NT News. ""He continued to walk along the fence line for two days and approached the pastoralist [farmer] today and the first thing he did was get some water."" Mr Tran was ""slightly disoriented"" but had been given food by the farmer and appeared to be in good spirits, she added. Police said Mr Tran's account had further narrowed down their search area for Ms Hockridge, adding it was unclear if she still had water. ""It's quite a diverse terrain - there's sandy dunes, there's hard clay, there's areas of dense trees but there is also rocks and ranges in the area as well,"" Supt Vicary told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.

Covid-19: Adverts urge people to 'keep going' and remain at home,"The government adverts come amid falling infection rates, the success of the vaccine rollout and the launch of the roadmap out of lockdown. People are also being urged to continue behavioural changes, including social distancing, hand washing and wearing face masks. The TV advert is being shown for the first time on Wednesday night on ITV. The campaign will also run on radio, advertising billboards and social media. On Wednesday, a further 9,938 cases were recorded across the UK as well as 442 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to government figures. It takes the death toll by that measure to 121,747. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said ""we must all continue to play our part"" in controlling the spread of the virus. He said: ""Infection rates are falling, but they still remain very high and the impact of Covid-19 is still putting pressure on hospitals across the country. ""Vaccines give clear hope for the future, but for now we must all continue to play our part in protecting the NHS and saving lives."" Wednesday's figures showed 18,242,873 have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The seven-day average for cases is down by 14.7% while deaths within 28 days of a positive test are down by 31%. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a four-step plan to ease England's lockdown, which could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met. In the first phase, on 8 March, schools will reopen and recreation in an outdoor public spaces - such as a park - will be allowed between two people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The British resolve during this pandemic has been astounding. We've all pulled together to help each other out. ""I know it's been a long year but we can't let up now. Everything we're doing is bringing us one step closer to beating this virus. ""The vaccine rollout is going extremely well and is saving lives - but it is not the only way we will reduce infection rates and be able to get back to normality. ""So let's keep going. I encourage everyone to keep playing their part and stay at home - keep washing your hands, wearing a mask and maintaining a social distance which will ensure that, together, we beat this.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hundreds of peregrine falcons kept secret 'for safety',"The progress of birds nesting at the top of buildings in Nottingham and Derby is broadcast daily on webcams as bird lovers wait for eggs to hatch. However the locations of many other nests are not revealed. The RSPB says it is keeping tight lipped to give the predatory birds ""peace and quiet"" to breed. 'Nervous wait' Last week it was announced a pair had nested near the Snake Pass in North Derbyshire and were thought to be sitting on four eggs. If breeding is successful, it will be the first time to happen in the area for seven years. Tim Melling, senior conservation officer for RSPB Northern England, said: ""It is important they don't get disturbed at this stage. ""There is a big finger of suspicion that foul play has been involved in the past so at the moment we are keeping quiet about where exactly they are. ""We are keeping an eye on them and our fingers crossed we will have something to celebrate in a month's time."" Mr Melling said the birds are often attacked or interfered with by gamekeepers, pigeon fanciers, egg collectors or illegal falconers. Peregrines nesting on a tower at Derby Cathedral and on a Nottingham university building have become more of an attraction in the last 10 years as their progress is broadcast on cameras. This week it was announced both pairs had laid eggs and conservationists say they were now ""waiting nervously"". Erin McDaid, from the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, said cold weather and rain sometimes makes things difficult for the peregrines. He said: ""We have nothing to do now but watch, which has been a bit fraught over the last couple of years because of interesting weather. ""We are still a little nervous we might get some colder weather in April."" Last year the birds faced thick snow and in 2012 the female bird abandoned her chicks in heavy rain and they died. 'Stunning and charismatic' Mr McDaid said the use of webcams had seen an increased interest in the birds. He added: ""They are stunning and charismatic birds and everyone should be able to see them but they are still under threat so the cameras were installed for security reasons. ""There are others we are aware of nesting in the region but we can't say where they are or how many for their safety. ""It also means we can't engage the public in helping us keep an eye on the nests because we are at the mercy of people who may have other intentions."" Eggs laid by the birds will now take up to 30 days to hatch.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pakistan attack: Gunmen storm five-star hotel in Balochistan,"The attack and subsequent siege, which targeted the Zaver Pearl-Continental Hotel in the strategic port city of Gwadar, lasted several hours. A hotel spokesman said there were no guests and few staff due to Ramadan. The separatist Balochistan Liberation Army said it carried out the attack. The group said that the hotel, the centrepiece of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese project, was selected in order to target Chinese and other investors. Militants in Balochistan oppose Chinese investment, saying it is of little benefit to local people. What do we know about the attack? The gunmen stormed the hotel, usually popular with top government officials and foreign visitors, at around 16:50 local time (11:50 GMT), killing at least one security guard who tried to stop them at the entrance. Security forces entered the hotel and took part in a gun battle with the militants, before cornering them in a staircase leading to the top floor, officials said. Due to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the hotel had no guests and a very limited number of staff, a Zaver Pearl-Continental spokesperson told the BBC. However, earlier reports suggested that hotel guests had been evacuated safely. The hotel sits on a hilltop overlooking the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea, which is being developed by China as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a network of roads, railway and pipelines between the two countries. On Twitter, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack, which comes just weeks after gunmen killed 14 people, including 11 military personnel, in the region. A worrying breach of security Gwadar is a city with a heavy military presence. It is viewed by both Chinese and Pakistani officials as the lynchpin of the CPEC, aiming to connect western China with the Arabian Sea. When I visited the port city in late 2017 with other international journalists, we travelled in convoys guarded by armed escorts, and stayed in the same hotel that was targeted. This attack will therefore be seen as a worrying breach of security, and it is not the first time Chinese interests have been targeted by this militant group. Last year the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) carried out an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi. After that attack, both Pakistani and Chinese officials stressed that violence would not derail their close co-operation. But militant activity in Balochistan remains one of the major concerns about the viability of the CPEC project. What is the situation in Balochistan? Home to a long-running insurgency, Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest and least developed province. It shares a large, porous border with Afghanistan and Iran. Its economy is dominated by natural resources, particularly natural gas, and is being transformed by major Chinese infrastructure projects on the CPEC, part of the ambitious Belt and Road initiative. Several militant groups operate in the region, including the Pakistani Taliban, the BLA and the Sunni Muslim extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
We rely on migrants to produce your food - young farmers,"In partnership with another farm, the 31-year-old employs hundreds of seasonal workers. Around 90% of them are migrants who help with the strawberry harvest, cereal crops and cattle. ""We find they're very hard working and do a very good job. ""Without them we probably wouldn't be able to do what we do."" For the first time in three years, net migration has fallen below 250,000. That's the difference between the number of people coming into the UK and the number of people leaving. In 2016 it fell to 248,000, that's a drop of 84,000 people compared to the year before. ""When the strawberries have to be harvested on a Sunday at four o'clock in the morning, we need a reliable workforce that's going to be able to do that for us,"" he tells Newsbeat. One of the workers employed by Richard is Fifi from Bulgaria. ""Bulgaria has no good money, this is the problem. Good country, everything is good but no good money."" Richard says that British people could do these jobs but from his experience, migrant employees want the work more. ""They don't complain, they get on with the job."" What they think about Brexit, now it's happening ""It is a worry but now that decision's been made it's for us to get behind government and tell them what we want,"" says Richard. He chairs the Next Generation Forum for the National Farmer's Union and hopes to help shape the future of farming for others like him. ""Farming is influenced a lot by politics so we want to be involved in those decisions because they're going to shape our future."" Here's what the main parties say about immigration Immigration is an issue that causes lots of arguments in the UK right now - and it's a major election issue. While farmers like Richard rely on it for their businesses, others want to see tighter restrictions. The Conservatives have been saying since 2010 that they want to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands - but that figure has yet to be met. Labour and the Liberal Democrats say they don't want to set targets on immigration. The Lib Dems want to offer sanctuary to 50,000 Syrian refugees. UKIP wants to reduce net migration to zero. The Greens want to look at Britain's role in causing the flow of refugees worldwide. The SNP wants full control of immigration powers for Scotland. Plaid Cymru want to set up a Welsh migration service. Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US economic growth revision to 3.7% boosts markets,"The economy grew by an annualised rate of 3.7%, up from the first estimate of 2.3%. Growth of 0.6% in the first three months of the year was not revised. The update reflected greater corporate investment than previously estimated. The growth in the economy overall was due to strong consumer and government spending, and higher exports. Inventories were also higher than the Commerce Department had initially estimated. The revision was welcome news to investors that have experienced a tough week on global stock markets, triggered by fears that the Chinese economy is slowing. They had expected the GDP number to be revised up, but not by as much as it was. Markets bounce ""A healthy upwards revision to US GDP should act as a much needed soothing balm for investors after the turbulence of this week,"" said Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. The news gave a sharp boost to the price of oil, which rose 10%, albeit from a very low base. The price had been at its lowest for more than six years, but despite the gain it remains well under $50 a barrel. Brent is at $47.50 and US light crude at $42.77 a barrel. Share values, too, responded immediately to the revised US data, adding to strong gains made in morning trading. The main London, Paris and Frankfurt exchanges all closed up more than 3%. Wall Street also jumped. The Dow Jones index closed up 366.72 points, or 2.3%, at 16,285.51. The revised figures are watched closely by investors looking for clues as to when US interest rates may rise. Earlier this week, a Federal Reserve official said that, given the stock market turmoil and fears for the Chinese economy, the case for an early rate rise was ""less compelling"". Prior to William Dudley's intervention, many economists had expected the Fed to raise rates in September. 'Off the table' The strong growth shown in the revised GDP figures will encourage some investors that an early rate rise may be back on the table, although next month remains unlikely, analysts said. ""Despite the good GDP numbers that we saw today, September largely seems off the table because of the turmoil that we've seen in the past week,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. Recent data, however, ""certainly points to a possibility of a rate hike this year,"" he added. US interest rates have been held at near-zero since the 2008 financial crisis. When they finally do rise, it will be the first interest rate increase in nine years.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Aurigny Air Services could be sold to Blue Islands,"The airline signed an ""in principle"" agreement with the Treasury and Resources Department to further develop terms for the possible sale. Both parties have agreed to undertake comprehensive due diligence before any firm agreements are put in place. Assuming a joint decision is reached, it will be subject to the approval of the whole of the States. Derek Coates, chief executive officer of the Healthspan Group which owns Blue Islands, said he believed neither airline was viable in the longer term if they continued to run as two separate organisations with the associated high and duplicated costs. He said: ""The underlying costs and overhead structures of airlines continue to increase year on year as regulation within the industry becomes more complex."" Both parties have agreed a mechanism by which Guernsey's London Gatwick slots would be protected. They said this was for the benefit of all islanders and the economy as a whole and that a merger between the two airlines would also preserve competition on the key Gatwick route, create a viable inter-island operator and relieve the taxpayer of footing the bill of the continuing losses at Aurigny. Treasury and Resources Minister Charles Parkinson said: ""In our view it is not the job of government to own an airline particularly where a private sector option exists. ""Government should simply be there to ensure that transport policies have the island's interests at heart. These include the protection of our lifeline routes. No alternative aircraft ""As the shareholder representative I would, on behalf of my board, like to put on record our appreciation of the dedication, hard work and loyalty of the Aurigny Group's management and staff."" Mr Coates said: ""If a final agreement is reached later this year and approved by the States it would be our intention to merge the two airlines, invest heavily in new more fuel-efficient aircraft and eventually phase out the old Trislanders as they reach the end of their natural lives. ""We will keep the best of the Trislander fleet to service Alderney, where there is currently no realistic alternative aircraft. We believe that by doing this we can return the airline to profitability within two years."" The sale would involve the purchase of Cabernet Limited, the parent company of Aurigny Air Services and Anglo Normandy Aeroengineering, an aircraft maintenance and repair facility based in Guernsey. The States agreed to buy the group for about £5m in May 2003. Aurigny, the Latin name for Channel Island Alderney, was started in 1968, employs about 290 staff throughout the Channel Islands, UK and France and earlier this year it carried its nine millionth passenger.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US election: Biden pledges billions to improve racial equality,"In a speech in his home town of Wilmington, Mr Biden promised to boost opportunities for black, Latino and Native American businesses. He accused President Donald Trump of stoking the flames of racism. He also accused Mr Trump of failing to protect people from coronavirus. Mr Biden holds a clear lead over the president in national polls. He said he would choose his running-mate ""in the first week in August"". He has already promised to choose a female vice-presidential candidate. ""This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump,"" Mr Biden said. ""It's about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people's struggles and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome."" The former vice-president to Barack Obama accused Mr Trump of playing politics of division. ""This is about trying to split the country. And so far, thank God, the American people aren't having any of it,"" he said. ""Did you ever think you'd see 77% of the people saying Black Lives Matter? Because they see what happens. And they're not buying into this racial division. That's what he's done since the beginning."" Mr Biden said he would ""leverage more than $150 billion [£116 billion] in new capital and opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally excluded for generations"". This would include by increasing access low-interest business loans. Trump is making Biden look strong Elections are often framed as a choice between continuity and change. Yet a selling point for Biden is that he offers voters a version of both. To the eight in 10 Americans who polling suggests believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, he is promising a course correction. Thus, he can plausibly present himself as a candidate of change. But by pledging to serve as a conventional president, returning to the norms of behaviour that Republicans and Democratic incumbents have abided by for decades, he also represents a continuum. The repair of a chain in which Trump became the missing link. Certainly, it would be an act of folly to write off Trump, who has walked away from more car crashes than any other sitting president. But over the past four years, the scar tissue has accumulated, and the pandemic has left him with self-inflicted wounds. Besides, even some of the supporters who placed their faith in him are tiring of his tricks of escapology - the boasts, the truth-twisting and the insults. This has become a Covid election. Now it is the president's weaknesses that are making Joe Biden look so strong. Read more of Nick's analysis here.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Single-use coffee cups ban in Scottish government buildings,"From 4 June, hot drinks will only be served in reusable mugs. It is hoped the move will prevent 450,000 cups from being thrown away every year. Staff were informed of the changes and the alternatives from the beginning of May to give them time to prepare for the change. The ban will apply to all hot drinks purchased in St Andrew's House, Saughton House, Victoria Quay, Atlantic Quay, Marine Lab and Buchanan House restaurants and cafes. Drinks will be served in reusable ceramic mugs for those sitting in and staff are being encouraged to bring their own cups for takeaways. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""The Scottish government is determined to lead by example when it comes to tackling the scourge of plastic littering our countryside and polluting our seas. ""By removing single use coffee cups from our main buildings, we will prevent 450,000 cups from being thrown away every year. ""That's enough cups to cover the distance between Edinburgh and Dundee. ""We support the EU's vision to reduce single use plastics as far as possible and ensure any single use plastics are easily recyclable by 2030. ""We are currently considering what other single-use items can be reduced and removed from Scottish government buildings later this year. ""Our newly appointed expert panel is considering what further action we can take to fight against our throwaway culture, and this will include looking at disposable cups and plastic straws and considering any potential implications for disabled people."" The panel is made up of experts from retail, waste and chemical industries, the public sector and academics. Electoral Commissioner Dame Sue Bruce is chair of the Expert Panel on Environmental Charges and Other Measures. In February this year, the Scottish Parliament stopped using plastic drinking straws in its own cafes, bar and canteen, having previously used about 4,000 plastic straws each year. Last month, Ms Cunningham invited environment ministers throughout the UK to come up with a coordinated bottle return scheme. And in January, the Scottish government announced plans to outlaw the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds following concern about the number of buds being washed up on beaches after being flushed down toilets. The Scottish Liberal Democrats meanwhile have been campaigning for a Scotland-wide levy on single-use cups, saying they could be ""sent packing just like plastic bags were"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tiangong rocket: China media reacts to space launch,"The People's Daily , a Communist Party mouthpiece, hailed the launch as a ""complete success"". That official view is echoed by thousands of web users, known in China as netizens. But the success was overshadowed by a subway train collision in Shanghai just two days before, in which over 280 people were injured. Several newspapers made comments contrasting the successful space launch with China's poor safety record in other sectors, and many netizens accused the government of prioritising a prestige project over public safety. 'Long live the motherland' The space launch dominated Chinese state TV broadcasts and front-pages of state newspapers, which heaped praise on Tiangong, which means ""heavenly palace"" in Chinese. ""On this beautiful night, the Chinese nation declared: Tiangong is no longer a palace of the gods and no longer a distant dream, but a new starting point for the Chinese to stride towards the starry skies,"" said the Liberation Army Daily , a paper run by the military. Thousands of netizens praised the launch as yet another manifestation of China's growing technological prowess. ""Watching the launch, I feel the motherland is getting more and more powerful. Long live the motherland!"" a netizen said on Sina Weibo , China's Twitter-like microblogging platform. 'Nothing to do with me' But some people expressed reservations. One netizen dismissed the launch as ""another prestige project that wastes manpower and money just for the National Day celebrations"". Tuesday's Shanghai subway accident and the high-speed railway crash in July still weigh heavily on people's minds. ""Tiangong launched successfully! Remarkable! But why can't you sort out the high-speed railway and the subway trains?"" said one microblogger. Another added: ""The safest transport vehicle in China is the rocket!"" Many internet users appeared to be indifferent. ""It has no direct connection with us ordinary folks. The only link is that it cost us money,"" said one microblogger. An online poll on Sina Weibo asked users whether they felt proud of the launch. As of 11:00 GMT on Friday, 40% of the 4,288 respondents answered Yes, while 47% clicked the response: ""It's got nothing to do with me."" The public sentiment was subtly reflected in some newspaper commentaries. The Beijing News suggested that government departments and businesses learn from the successful space project in order to reduce product quality problems and public safety accidents.

Douglas Carswell: Grandparents 'need more of a say' in adoptions,"Deborah McGurranPolitical editor, East of England The UKIP MP has called for special guardianship orders to be used more widely, which would allow more grandparents to look after children. ""Family courts are presiding over monstrous injustices,"" the MP said when he called for the opening up of family courts in a Westminster Hall debate. Mr Carswell also made the point that some people manage the system better than others. ""It seems that articulate, highly-educated people who have access to information are able to fight off the system, but people who do not have access to information and are not as eloquent as lawyers tend to be trampled,"" he said. ""Many of the most tragic cases I have come across in Clacton involve people whose love for their grandchildren is as strong as anyone's, but who are just not very articulate and are therefore trampled over by the monstrously unjust and unfair system."" Lucy Allan, the Conservative MP for Telford, agreed, saying: ""This is an issue that is long overdue for debate in this House."" The interest of the child Edward Timpson, the minister for children and families, was not unsympathetic. He said it was an important and sensitive area and set out the principle that the system of family justice in England was based on the premise that children live with their family wherever possible. He said the key was what was in the best interest of the child, and that local authorities must consider placing a child with relatives - including grandparents. ""Where it is decided that it is not possible for children to remain with their parents, the law is clear that local authorities must consider placing a child with relatives, including grandparents and friends, before considering other permanency options,"" he said. He reminded Mr Carswell that the number of special guardianship orders have doubled since they were introduced in 2005. He concluded: ""The president of the family division is consulting on the matter, and we look forward to his response, so that we may see what more we can do to ensure confidence in the family justice system.""

Coronavirus: Fifteen virus deaths at Wavertree care home,"Andrea Lyons, who runs Oak Springs in Wavertree, Liverpool, said it was ""like losing 15 grandparents"". New Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows more than 217 people had died of Covid-19 in care homes in England and Wales up to 3 April. And a healthcare body has warned the spread of coronavirus in care homes has ""largely gone under the radar"". The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said this was due to the way data on deaths has been collected. Age UK said current figures on coronavirus deaths ""are airbrushing older people"". Among other care homes affected by the pandemic was Stanley Park, in Stanley, County Durham where 13 residents have died after displaying symptoms of the virus. There have also been nine deaths at Wren Hall Nursing Home in Selston, Nottinghamshire, from suspected coronavirus. Edgemont View Nursing Home, on the outskirts of Bristol, has reported a ""number"" of deaths linked to the pandemic. The government has confirmed there have been outbreaks at more than 2,000 care homes in England, but did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred. ""The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,"" Age UK director Caroline Abraham said. Britain's largest care home operator HC-One said coronavirus was present in two-thirds - 232 - of its homes. The ONS figures show more than one in five deaths in England and Wales is linked to coronavirus, with Covid-19 mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending 3 April. Unlike the daily figures, which only include people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital, the ONS includes deaths in other settings. Its data shows one in 10 coronavirus deaths this year have been in the community with more than half - 217 - in care homes. 'Very difficult time' Ms Lyons said: ""It is like losing 15 grandparents all in the space of two weeks. ""You spend every day with these people - 12 hours a day - often more than... your own family. ""It has been a very difficult time."" Oak Springs appealed earlier this month for more ""hands-on"" staff after 50 of its 72 workers had to self-isolate. Ms Lyons said she had managed to fill the rota after an ""absolutely amazing response"" from agency staff, ex-doctors and Liverpool City Council. An independent care home in Southport, Merseyside, with 25 residents, said it had not had a single case of the virus or any staff off self-isolating.

Kanhaiya Kumar: 'Sedition' student returns to JNU with fiery speech,"Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested last month after a rally against the execution of a Kashmiri separatist convicted over the 2001 Indian parliament attack. He was released from jail on Thursday after being granted bail. Mr Kumar's views have been divisive in India with some calling him ""anti-nationalist"". The authorities allege Mr Kumar and others shouted anti-India slogans at the 9 February rally that took place at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Two other students remain in custody. On Thursday, Mr Kumar returned to JNU and said in his speech that he wanted freedom ""in"" and not ""from"" India. Media reports said that close to 3,000 students turned up to hear him speak. Mr Kumar took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government, saying that the backlash against him was to distract the people from its failings in other areas. He vowed to continue the ""fight"" against the ""oppressive"" policies of the government, saying that the more students were suppressed, the more they would stand up. The government has not yet commented on the speech, which has sparked a huge reaction online. #KanhaiyaKumar was trending on Facebook India, Twitter India and Twitter global trends on Thursday night, as television channels beamed his speech live. On Friday morning, the hashtag #Azaadi (freedom) was also trending in the country, though sentiments remained sharply divided. YouTube links to his speech are also being widely circulated on social media. Critics condemned the charges against the students as an assault on freedom of expression, but government ministers have refused to back down, vowing to punish what they describe as ""anti-national elements"". The 9 February rally that prompted the arrests was to mark the third anniversary of the 2013 hanging of Mohammed Afzal Guru. Guru was one of those convicted of plotting the 2001 parliament attack - charges he always denied. The attack, which left 14 people dead, was blamed on Pakistan-based militants fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. Indian opposition parties see the affair as an attempt by the BJP to push its Hindu nationalist agenda, correspondents say. There have also been counter protests by those who say JNU is a hotbed of ""traitors"" and should be ""cleaned up"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gurkhas march to remember fallen comrades,"Two hundred soldiers marched from Wellington Barracks past Buckingham Palace and along the Mall to the Gurkha memorial statue in Whitehall. Those taking part said their thoughts were with the thousands killed and injured in the earthquake in Nepal. The Army's 3,000-strong Brigade of Gurkhas consists of Nepalese soldiers. Its origins are found in Gurkha units which served in the British Indian Army prior to Indian independence. The brigade carried the Queen's Truncheon during the march, a bronze and silver ceremonial staff awarded to the 2nd Gurkhas by Queen Victoria. This was in recognition of the brigade's loyalty during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. During the march, wreaths were laid at a memorial service held at the Gurkha statue, which bears new plaques honouring those who have taken part in recent operations. They are the first plaques to be installed since the statue was unveiled in 1997. More than 11,000 ex-Gurkhas have settled in the UK. Meanwhile, a team of Gurkha engineers has flown out to Nepal on an RAF flight to join aid efforts following the earthquake which has killed at least 5,500 people. Officials say Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake injured at least 11,000 people. More than 8m people have been affected and about 70,000 houses destroyed, the UN says. Captain Lok Bahadur Gurung, who took part in the march, told the BBC it was a ""proud and sad day"". He said: ""Proud in a way that we, the Gurkhas, are celebrating 200 years of our service to the British Crown, and sad in a way because of the earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday. ""We could not cancel this event because of the recent earthquake. It was planned a year ahead and we, the soldiers, we had to go on with the situation, and bear it."" Captain Gary Ghale, formerly of the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles, said communicating with villages such as his native Gorkha was very difficult. He said: ""To see all these heart-wrenching pictures, I am just praying, just praying for the safety of the people of Nepal and that help reaches people in time and there is proper sanitisation because the aftermath can kill more people than the earthquake itself.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"GP out-of-hours service 'not safe' in north Wales, say staff","The leaked document includes responses from 117 staff and 84% said at times they felt the service was ""not safe"". The health board said it commissioned the report as the basis of an action plan which was being implemented. However the report also identified ""a clear sense of pride"" in the service and the dedication of staff. The report by a team of consultants in March compared the north Wales service against recognised Welsh standards. All ""very urgent cases"" should have a face-to-face consultation within an hour but, last year, that was achieved only half the time in north Wales. The standards say 100% of urgent calls should have a definitive assessment in 20 minutes. The service managed 80%. Concern was raised about unfilled shifts resulting in long waits for help on the phone and lack of leadership. The out of hours service, which operates when GP practices are closed, is delivered from three centres at the district hospitals in Wrexham, Bodelwyddan and Bangor. The service at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor is said to be the most effective. Prestatyn GP Dr Eamonn Jessup, who is on the out-of-hours GP rota based at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, said staffing was a key issue. ""The report is very heavy on the management and how management can be improved but I do concern myself that you can get as many managers in as you would wish but, at the end of the day, they can't magically make up that number of nurse practitioners and doctors,"" he said. ""The problem is down to recruitment."" In a statement, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it had commissioned the study and that ""the process was transparent"" with staff having had sight of the final report. It said: ""We welcome the report which has made a number of recommendations. These formed the basis of an action plan which is currently being implemented."" Clwyd West AM Darren Millar, shadow health spokesman, said he had not seen any proof that action was being taken. ""You can see that these problems go back a long time and have not been addressed,"" he said, while studying the report. The Welsh government said it did not comment on leaked reports. Key findings ""There was an almost total lack of understanding regarding performance amongst all staff members in the survey and clinicians in both the interviews and site visits. ""Performance is perceived as a management issue, not a clinical one,"" the report said. Full report on BBC Wales Today on Tuesday 12 May from 18:30 BST",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Further Edinburgh schools closed over structure concerns,"St Peter's RC Primary, Firrhill High and Braidburn Special Schools were built by the same contractor as Oxgangs Primary, which was closed on Wednesday. A wall at Oxgangs collapsed during Storm Gertrude in January. A safety inspection revealed there were issues with how the external wall was erected when the school was built 10 years ago. The contractors were working under the Public Private Partnership 1 project. St Peter's will be closed on Friday and will remain shut until the end of the Easter holidays. Edinburgh City Council said it was looking into alternative schooling arrangements for next week. The school was closed following a detailed survey carried out by the Edinburgh Schools Partnership. The survey focussed on the external walls of the school buildings which identified an issue with the width of the wall cavities and the wall ties. Firrhill and Braidburn will be closed on Friday to allow ""further detailed tests"" to be carried out over the weekend. Fencing will be put up around the affected area at Firrhill High with the school reopening on Monday. The council said if Braidburn school could not reopen on Monday then alternative arrangements would be put in place. Hundreds of bricks were blown from Oxgangs Primary school during the January storms. It is expected to reopen on 11 April. 'Rushed action' Councillor Paul Godzik, education convener, said: ""The health and safety of our pupils and staff is our top priority and therefore the council has decided to temporarily close these schools as a purely precautionary measure. ""Whilst the survey results have indicated that these schools could continue to operate in normal weather conditions until the necessary works are carried out we are unwilling to take any risk. ""We fully recognise the inconvenience caused by these closures and we would like to apologise to parents for this, however I am sure everyone will understand why we have taken these steps."" The council said it would update parents at Braidburn Special and St Peter's schools with more information as soon as possible. Councillor Melanie Main, education spokeswoman for Edinburgh Greens, said safety must be a priority but questioned how parents could be expected to cope with the short notice. She said: ""On the face of it, it looks like something has gone badly wrong with the way these private school building contracts have been handled, both in building and in ongoing maintenance, that such rushed action has had to be taken. ""Once any emergency work is completed it is crucial that responsibility for these failings is established.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump chooses pro-settlement hardliner as Israel envoy,"The 57-year-old lawyer is strongly critical of the long-held US goal of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He also supports Jewish settlement building in the occupied West Bank and moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. A senior Palestinian official warned that such moves ""will be the destruction of the peace process"". Veteran negotiator Saeb Erekat said moving the embassy and ""annexing"" settlements in the West Bank would send the region down a path to ""chaos, lawlessness and extremism"". However, he said he did not really believe that Mr Trump would approve either action. ""The United States at the end of the day is a country of institutions, and they are guided by their national interests,"" he said. Mr Friedman said earlier he looked forward to working ""from the US Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem"". The United Nations does not recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and the US embassy has been located in Tel Aviv for decades. Analysis: Yolande Knell, Reporter, Cairo It's no surprise that the president-elect has made a controversial choice to represent his administration in Israel. But the views of his long-time friend and campaign adviser on Jewish issues mark a complete break with American foreign policy which has been followed by Democratic and Republican administrations alike. David Friedman has made his support for Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem clear. But the current White House says those settlements undermine the chances for peace. He's also indicated that he'll help fulfil Mr Trump's promise to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, despite international objections. Israel occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their promised future state - but Israel claims the entire city as its undivided capital. Mr Friedman advised Mr Trump on US-Israel issues during the election campaign. A liberal Jewish group opposed his nomination. Conservatives welcomed it. J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group based in Washington, said it was ""vehemently"" opposed to the nomination of Mr Friedman. ""As someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as 'worse than kapos', Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel,"" it said. Kapos were Jewish prisoners in Nazi camps in World War II who the SS put in charge of other inmates. They have been viewed by some as complicit in the brutal treatment of other prisoners. The Zionist Organization for America, a conservative US pro-Israel group, welcomed the nomination, saying Mr Friedman had ""the potential to be the greatest US ambassador to Israel ever"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not enjoyed warm relations with Democratic President Barack Obama, has welcomed Mr Trump's election. David Friedman",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India election 2019: Bringing power to the people,"By Shadab NazmiBBC Reality Check ""Yesterday, we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be changed forever,"" Mr Modi tweeted in April 2018. In the run-up to the Indian election, which gets under way on 11 April, BBC Reality Check examines claims and pledges made by the main political parties. So does this claim stand up to scrutiny? Let's start by looking at villages. There are almost 600,000 villages in India, according to the 2011 census. The government defines a village as fully electrified if 10% of its households, as well as public places such as schools and health centres, are connected to the grid. By this definition, all villages have now been electrified, according to official data. However, much of the work had been done under the previous governments. When Mr Modi took office, 96% of all the villages in India were already electrified. That left about 18,000 villages to go. Before the BJP came to power, India had the world's largest electricity access deficit - 270 million people. That accounted for just under a third of the overall global deficit, according to the World Bank's 2017 State of Electricity Access report. The World Bank estimates that nearly 85% of the entire population now has access to power supply - that's slightly higher than the government estimate of 82%. What about households? The project Mr Modi launched in September 2017 aimed to provide electricity to all Indian households by December 2018, covering 40 million families, primarily targeting rural India. Virtually all Indian households have now been electrified, according to the government's data. As of March, just 19,753 households are left. The current government has suggested it has been electrifying villages at a faster rate than the previous one. However, using central electricity authority data, we found that under the previous Congress-led government, an average of more than 9,000 villages a year were being electrified compared with the Modi government's average of more than 4,000 villages a year. Problems with supply Although substantial progress has been made to electrify Indian villages - both by the current and previous administrations - the quality of the supply remains a problem, especially in rural areas. Only six out of 29 states receive a 24-hour power supply, according to a government response to a question in India's parliament. Just under half of villages have more than 12 hours of domestic electricity a day and a third receive between eight and 12 hours, according to government data. States with the highest percentage of villages that receive between just one and four hours of electricity a day include Jharkhand, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh.

"Manx Chronicles 'should be returned to the Isle of Man', says MLC","The Chronicles of the Kings of Mann and the Isles is a Latin document recording early Manx history. At this year's Illiam Dhone ceremony, Bill Henderson MLC called for the Manx government to ""rescue"" the document from the British Library. The manuscript passed into private hands when Rushen Abbey closed in 1540. It became part of the Cotton library, which was one of the foundation collections of the British Museum when it was established in 1753. 'Permanent loan' Mr Henderson said: ""There must be something we can do to rescue our Chronicles of Mann, the most important historical and cultural Manx artefact. ""We need to do more, I for one will be continuing this call with other Tynwald members,"" he added. Daphne Caine MHK, who attended the ceremony, said: ""I can see no reason why the manuscript cannot be held here in the island on permanent loan, where it means something to the people."" The document is bound together with a number of other historical works which are largely unrelated to the Isle of Man. It has been displayed four times in the island, most recently at the Manx Museum in 2013, on loan from the British Library. Manx National Heritage has previously said it would welcome the chance to house the document on an ongoing basis. Director Edmund Southworth said trustees ""would be happy to support any initiatives undertaken by the Isle of Man Government in relation to the future of the Chronicles"". The British Library has a legal obligation to care for its foundation collections, and a permanent loan or transfer of ownership of the items would require a change in UK law. Mr Henderson made the comments while giving a speech at the annual Illiam Dhone ceremony, held to commemorate the death of Manx martyr William Christian. Known as Illiam Dhone or Dark-haired William, Christian surrendered the island to the Parliamentarians in 1651 during the English civil war, and was executed for treason about 10 years later. The annual ceremony was revived by Mec Vannin and the Celtic League in 1979, and sees speeches delivered in English and Manx, followed by the laying of a wreath. It takes place at Hango Hill in Castletown, the spot where Christian was killed by a firing squad in 1663.

Manhole cover thieves 'may get death sentences' in China,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring The Supreme People's Court, The Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security have issued a joint statement, instructing courts to penalise people more strictly if they have been found to steal or damage manhole covers, the official People's Daily reports. The statement said that the removal or destruction of manhole covers was sufficient for people to be charged with either ""endangering transportation"", or ""endangering public safety"". The maximum penalty for both of these charges is the death sentence. The official People's Daily said that it was of the view of the highest legal powers that ""the theft or destruction of manhole covers on the road… is sufficient to overturn/destroy a car or tram"". 'Manhole maniacs' Wan Chun, a senior official at China's highest agency responsible for prosecution, explained the move, saying: ""Manhole covers are often ignored, but they very much relate to people's lives, personal safety and property security"". ""Stealing or destroying a manhole cover cannot be just identified as committing crimes of theft or destroying property. Instead, the offenders should be given harsher punishment."" The guideline also stipulates that those who work in state organs could also be charged with ""crimes of dereliction of duty and abuse of power"", the official Xinhua News Agency says. You may also be interested in: According to China Daily, there were more than 70 injuries or deaths due to broken or stolen manhole covers between 2017 and 2019. Some people have attempted to steal manhole covers in order to sell them for scrap metal. China Daily notes that there has also been a problem with taxi drivers removing manhole covers to ""steal water and clean their vehicles"". The new laws have ignited lively conversation on Chinese social media platforms. Social media users say that people in the central province of Henan have gained a reputation at a national level for such behaviour. The Global Times once called them ""manhole maniacs"". This has even become the subject of a sketch in China's annual Spring Festival gala. Many voice their support for the new laws, but others are more critical, noting that the laws do not factor in a much bigger problem in the country: drink-driving.

Justin Bieber apologises after cancelling rest of Purpose World Tour,"The move affects 14 dates in Asia and North America which were coming up over the next three months. Bieber told celebrity news website TMZ.com: ""I'm sorry for anybody who feels disappointed or betrayed."" The singer has performed more than 150 shows on the tour, promoting his 2015 album Purpose, since March 2016. The tour grossed $93.2m (£71.5m) in the first half of 2017, with an average of almost 40,000 ticket sales per date. Bieber added: ""I have been on tour for two years. I'm looking forward to just resting, getting some relaxation and we're going to ride some bikes."" The singer's manager, Scooter Braun, posted on Instagram: ""To Justin, who gave it his all night after night, thank you. ""And to those that won't be able to see it... on behalf of myself, Justin, and the team, we are sorry. That was never our intent. But a man's soul and wellbeing I truly care about came first and we must all respect and honour that. ""Justin will be back and I know he looks forward to performing for you and with you all again. One chapter ends and another begins."" A statement on Bieber's website read: ""Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. ""He is grateful and honoured to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. ""However, after careful consideration he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase."" Most of Bieber's remaining dates were in the US, but he was also due to play in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia. Chinese officials said last week that the Canadian pop star had been banned from mainland China because he had engaged in what they described as ""bad behaviour"".

Leicester primary closes as only two teachers willing to return,"Shaftesbury Junior School in Leicester told parents on Sunday it would not reopen until next week at the earliest. It is one of dozens of East Midlands primary schools to have to partially or fully close after unions called for a ""pause"" in the return to school. The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Karl Stewart, the junior school head teacher, said he would have opened the 230-pupil school as planned on Tuesday after an inset day on Monday but as only two of his nine teachers were willing to come in, that will not be possible. They will now move to online learning. He said: ""I respect the teachers' decision. ""It's not that my staff don't want to be here, school is the best place for kids - it's about the transmission rates being so high."" Mr Stewart recognised some parents supported schools staying open and some did not but said: ""The messages we've had so far from parents have been positive - things like, 'thank you for not coming back'."" Analysis Navtej Johal, East Midlands Today Dozens of primary schools across the East Midlands have been forced to close to all but vulnerable children and those with parents who are key workers. The National Education Union (NEU) estimates about 45% of primary schools in Leicester could move to full or partial remote teaching over the next two weeks. The prime minister has insisted schools are safe and risk to children is ""very, very low"". But city councils in Leicester, Nottingham and Derby, and Nottinghamshire County Council, said they will support any schools who feel it isn't safe to reopen. Meanwhile, the leader of Derbyshire County Council says decisions on openings ""are made by individual schools according to their circumstances"" and that it ""would support primary schools returning as planned"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" Some parents of children from other schools in Leicester have chosen not to send their kids back to the classroom, due to fears of rising Covid case numbers. Dr Alex Patel's seven-year-old daughter Sofiya was supposed to return to Brocks Hill Primary School in Oadby on Monday but has instead been kept at home. Dr Patel, a learning development adviser at Leicester University, said: ""I'm absolutely convinced that schools are the worst places to be. ""Before Christmas there were classes of 30, they were trying as much as they could to keep safe but the social distancing wasn't there."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Campaign targets modern slavery in UK,"It intends to encourage the public to identify signs of slavery and report them to a new national helpline. The Human Trafficking Foundation charity estimates 20,000 people are working in slavery in the UK, and says that number is rising. The Home Office hopes Parliament will pass an anti-slavery bill before the general election. It is spending £2.3m on the TV, online and poster awareness campaign, which will run until October. The TV advert shows three of the most common types of modern slavery: It concludes with the caption, ""Slavery is closer than you think"". The national helpline, which is supported by children's charity the NSPCC, will offer information and advice to child and adult victims of slavery, as well as to professionals and members of the public. Home Secretary Theresa May said the campaign aimed to ""bring this hidden crime out into the open"". ""It is difficult to accept that modern Britain is home to slavery, but this appalling crime is taking place here - often out of sight - in shops, fields, building sites and behind the curtains of houses on ordinary streets,"" she said. Forced into prostitution One trafficking victim told the BBC Asian Network how she was assured that she would be working as a babysitter when she was brought to the UK at the age of 16 from Eastern Europe. She was taken to what appeared to be a massage parlour, where she was forced into prostitution. ""I came here and they made me sleep with men - basically I was treated like a slave,"" she said. ""All the girls had to come out of a room and stand up in a line, and one man chose me, and I went up in the bedroom and there he told me to take my clothes off."" Though the police found her, the traffickers, who raped and abused her, were not arrested. ""I can very easily again be a victim of the traffickers,"" she said. ""I'm afraid when I sleep at night, when I'm walking on the street."" Compensation There is no official figure for the number of victims trafficked into the country each year. However, in 2013 the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking, the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), received 1,746 referrals of potential victims of trafficking - a 47% increase on the previous year. The Modern Slavery Bill, featured in the last Queen's Speech, would grant courts in England and Wales new powers to protect people trafficked into the UK, held against their will and forced to work. It would ensure compensation was paid to victims and change the maximum jail sentence for those convicted of slavery-related offences from 14 years to life.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Australia jet and navy data stolen in 'extensive' hack,"About 30GB of data was compromised in the hack on a government contractor, including details about new fighter planes and navy vessels. The data was commercially sensitive but not classified, the government said. It did not know if a state was involved. Australian cyber security officials dubbed the mystery hacker ""Alf"", after a character on TV soap Home and Away. The breach began in July last year, but the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) was not alerted until November. The hacker's identity is not known. ""It could be one of a number of different actors,"" Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Thursday. ""It could be a state actor, [or] a non-state actor. It could be someone who was working for another company."" Mr Pyne said he had been assured the theft was not a risk to national security. Weaknesses exploited The hack was described as ""extensive and extreme"" by ASD incident response manager Mitchell Clarke. It included information about Australia's new A$17bn (£10bn; $13bn) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, C130 transport plane and P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft, as well as ""a few"" naval vessels, he said. Mr Clarke told a Sydney security conference that the hacker had exploited a weakness in software being used by the government contractor. The software had not been updated for 12 months. The aerospace engineering firm was also using default passwords, he said. ASD officials began repairing the system in December. A report by ZDNet said officials referred to the months before ASD intervention as ""Alf's mystery happy fun time"". ""For those visitors overseas to Australia, Alf is Alf Stewart from an horrific Australia soap opera called Home and Away. It's just a thing we do,"" Mr Clarke told his audience, according to BuzzFeed. 'Salutary reminder' The government distanced itself from the Adelaide-based firm, saying it had most likely been employed by another contractor. ""I don't think you can try and sheet blame for a small enterprise having lax cyber security back to the federal government. That is a stretch,"" Mr Pyne said. ""Fortunately, the data that was taken was commercial data, not military data, but it is still very serious and we will get to the bottom of it."" However, he said ""we don't necessarily let the public know"" about the identities of hackers, because such investigations often involve confidential information. The incident was a ""salutary reminder"" about cyber security, he added. Last year, Australia announced a surge in defence spending, a move that reflects concern over military expansion in the region. Military spending would grow by A$29.9bn over 10 years, including plans to buy 72 Joint Strike Fighters, the 2016 Defence White Paper outlined.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid in Scotland: 'Last stop' on A9 closes amid travel restrictions,"The Ralia Café near Newtonmore is in Highland, a level one area. But much of its custom comes from people travelling to and from parts of Scotland placed under the tighter rules of levels three and four. Since April, visitor numbers have fallen by 63% compared with the same time last year. In a ""normal"" year the café owners expect about 150,000 customers, with an additional 100,000 just using its toilets. The levels system and travel rules have been put in place to supress the spread of Covid-19. The Ralia Café is located on the A9 close to Highland Council's boundary with Perth and Kinross - a level three area. For travellers it is the road's last comfort break going south, after Newtonmore and its facilities, before leaving the Highland Council area, and the first heading north after leaving Perth and Kinross. The café opened in July 2005 on the site of a former tourist information centre and is run by Robin and Sheila Lambie who live in Kingussie. Mr Lambie said: ""We closed the café on Sunday until travel restrictions are lifted, and my team is furloughed yet again."" The toilets have also been closed. 'Legally restricting' The café could open again before the end of the year when, for a short time over the Christmas break, rules on travel are due to be relaxed. But Mr Lambie said: ""It is really impossible to tell at this stage."" He said that despite the ""fantastic location"" for anyone travelling north or south, revenue for 2020 was currently down 63% against the same period last year. ""Going to levels three and four immediately halved our turnover and legally restricting travel halved it again."" Everyone living in level three or level four local authority areas must, by law, remain within their own council boundaries unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"" for doing so. People in level four must also keep journeys within their own area to an absolute minimum. Meanwhile, people in level one or level two areas must avoid any unnecessary travel to areas that are under level three or four restrictions and should minimise unnecessary journeys between areas in different levels.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mental health in Norfolk and Suffolk '£30m underfunded',"By Nic RigbyBBC News Michael Scott said some of Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust's (NSFT) front line services were suffering. He said the trust had been forced to overspend by £2m this year. The government said it had gone ""further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health"". On Saturday the BBC revealed the trust had 50 patients in beds outside the counties, due to a lack of funding and a shortage of beds. The Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk and Suffolk has said the trust's programme to make £40m of cuts by 2018 has had a ""devastating impact on people who rely on mental health services"". Mr Scott told the BBC: ""The trust is dramatically underfunded. The money that comes through from the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) is insufficient for the services we provide. ""If we had been funded the same level as our local acute hospitals, we would have £30m more than we do. ""This year we are about £2m overspent. That's a direct result of not having sufficient income coming into the trust."" 'Very supportive' He said the NHS budget had grown modestly but had ""not found its way into the mental health"". ""Our Clinical Commisioning Groups (CCG) are very supportive but there are national funding mechanisms. That means the money is not going to mental health,"" he said. While mainstream hospital funding is based on the number of patients, mental health receives a block grant unrelated to the number of users. This has seen the budgets of the mainstream hospitals in the two counties rise by 15% since 2010, while mental health service funding, despite a 4.4% increase in users, has fallen by 3%. A spokesman for the Norfolk and Suffolk CCGs said: ""Mr Scott notes that local CCGs are very supportive, and directs all of his comments towards national funding formulas. ""Mental health is funded on the same basis as elsewhere in England."" The Department of Health said: ""We have gone further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health and have instructed the NHS to make sure every community does the same.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China veterans urge sacking of politician Zhou Yongkang,"By Michael BristowBBC News, Beijing Mr Zhou is currently in charge of China's security apparatus. In an open letter to President Hu, the party's general secretary, the veterans suggest Mr Zhou is part of a movement to revive the China of Mao Zedong. Speculation has been growing about the future of Mr Zhou since the downfall of another top politician, Bo Xilai. It is not often that party members make such a daring plea to their boss. The letter urges the president to sack Mr Zhou from his post as head of China's police force, its courts and its spy network. He is also a member of the standing committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the country's highest decision-making body. The letter's authors, who all know each other, also want him out of that job too. Veteran members Some of the veteran party members who wrote the note joined the Chinese communists before they took power in 1949. They hold no senior positions - and do not seem to be particularly influential. But one of the authors, Yu Yongqing, told the BBC that they had received hundreds of calls of support, and some threatening ones. Mr Yu, who held a senior position in the party in the city of Zhaotong in Yunnan province, said Mr Zhou had to go because of his support for Bo Xilai. Mr Bo was recently sacked from his position in the party's politburo and as party secretary of the city of Chongqing, where he led a campaign that sought to revive interest in the Mao Zedong era. ""Mr Bo confessed that he has received support from Zhou Yongkang. Mr Zhou also helped him to make contact with various central party departments,"" said Mr Yu. The letter seems to warn about the dangers of reviving an interest in Chairman Mao and his policies. It stresses the danger China faces from such things as corruption and the inequality of wealth without political reform. For weeks there has been speculation about the future of Mr Zhou. There has been no official comment, but this letter shows there is some concern about Mr Zhou within the party. The letter also calls for the sacking of Liu Yunshan, the head of the party's propaganda department. He has been tipped for promotion later this year when the party holds a once-in-a-decade reshuffle of its top leaders.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Concern over 'remote supervision' of offenders by phone,"In a report, Dame Glenys Stacey said widespread use of the practice in England and Wales was ""not acceptable"". The findings also revealed some junior probation officers had 200 cases at once. Dame Glenys said poor supervision was ""a risk to the public"". The government said supervision by phone was only for low-risk cases. But it acknowledged that improvements were needed to raise the standard of probation services. The government's probation reforms, known as Transforming Rehabilitation, launched three years ago and split offender supervision between a state-run service and 21 privately-operated companies. It created the National Probation Service (NPS) to deal with high-risk offenders, while Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) were assigned low and medium-risk cases. 'Two-tier system' An offender given a community sentence may be required to undertake unpaid work or attend a government-sanctioned programme. In her annual report, Dame Glenys said the government's probation reforms had created a ""two-tier and fragmented"" system in which the private companies were ""struggling"" and she questioned whether the probation system could ""deliver sufficiently well"". It revealed some offenders were only met once before being placed on ""remote supervision"" by private probation providers. That could amount to no more than a telephone call every six weeks, with no further face-to-face meetings taking place. Inspectors said the calls were little more than ""checking in"" and made it difficult to assess any change in the risk posed to the public. These arrangements are allowed under the terms of the contracts, but the report emphasised that face-to-face work was vital. It also found that inexperienced probation staff were responsible for monitoring 200 offenders each, when the recommended maximum number is 60. Dame Glenys said: ""I find it inexplicable that, under the banner of innovation, these developments were allowed. ""We should all be concerned, given the rehabilitation opportunities missed, and the risks to the public if individuals are not supervised well."" Jacob Tas, chief executive of social justice charity Nacro, said there had been almost daily reports of problems and called for the government to act ""urgently"" to address failings. Analysis By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw It is hard to see this report as anything other than a damning indictment of the probation reforms introduced in 2014, by Chris Grayling, when he was justice secretary. The 113-page document details how the privatised part of the new system simply is not functioning properly, with unmanageable caseloads and supervision-by-phone the most glaring examples. The significance of these failings should not be under-estimated. Successful rehabilitation hinges on having a relationship of trust between offender and probation officer. That is exceptionally difficult if they are not in regular face-to-face contact. The findings will also do little to inspire confidence in community sentences at a time when the government is encouraging judges and magistrates to consider non-custodial alternatives to the more costly option of imprisonment.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ukraine fears Russia will use exercises next week to invade,"In a major speech, Mr Poroshenko said Russia's Zapad-2017 exercises with Belarus might be ""a smokescreen to create new Russian army assault groups to invade Ukrainian territory"". Russia says 13,000 troops will take part in Zapad, on 14-20 September. Russian-backed rebels have carved out a swathe of territory in eastern Ukraine. The Kiev government accuses Russia of supplying regular troops and sophisticated heavy weaponry to the rebels. Moscow denies any direct involvement, while admitting that Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels. ""There are no signs that Moscow is ready to pull out of Donbas or Crimea,"" Mr Poroshenko said in his state-of-the-nation address. ""But unfortunately there is more and more proof of its preparations for an offensive war on a continental scale."" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March 2014, triggering international sanctions. Special forces in unmarked camouflage seized key installations, and only much later did President Vladimir Putin admit that it was a Russian state operation. Ukraine sues Russia for 'terrorism' Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter Crimea - not an easy place to get to Mr Poroshenko said the Zapad-2017 drill ""was the main reason for beefing up security on all stretches of our state border"". ""Zapad"" in Russian means ""west"". There is speculation that Russia may deploy many more troops than the 13,000 its defence ministry has mentioned. ""Seven thousand flatcars with troops and hardware have approached the territory of Ukraine, and unfortunately there are no guarantees that after the drill is over they will all return home from Belarus,"" Mr Poroshenko said. Russian security troops deployed during the Sochi Olympics in 2014 had gone into Crimea, he said. And Russian military units involved in a drill in the Caucasus in 2008 were later involved in the war against Georgia. Turning to the shaky ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, he rejected Mr Putin's call for a peacekeeping mission to be deployed along the line of contact, between the Ukrainian army and the separatists. Instead, he insisted, UN peacekeepers should be deployed across the entire rebel-controlled area, including the border with Russia. And he ruled out any role for the Russian military in such a force.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India tiger cubs 'may become man-eaters',"By Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service It is believed their mother, who was shot dead in the state of Maharashtra after a major hunt this month, had killed 13 people. The six-year-old tigress had evaded capture for two years. Her killing angered conservationists and it is hoped the 11-month-old cubs can be tranquillised and caught. ""They need to be rescued because they can become a potential threat to human beings,"" AK Misra, the principal chief forest conservator of Maharashtra, told the BBC. Mr Misra said for now the cubs could survive by hunting small wild animals in the forests of Yavatmal. ""But because this area is not a national park nor is it a proper forest, they may go for easy prey in the nearby human settlements. And we want to pre-empt that potential danger, "" he said. He said officials had traced the cubs' location, but because of the difficult terrain their capture was taking some time. ""We are waiting for the right opportunity to tranquilise them. We are not in hot pursuit; we want to make sure that we do this successfully."" The hunt for the tigress, known as T-1, involved more than 100 camera traps, horses and goats tied to trees as bait, round-the-clock surveillance from treetop platforms and armed patrols. Wildlife officials also brought in bottles of the cologne, Obsession for Men by Calvin Klein, which contains a pheromone called civetone, after an experiment in the US suggested that it could be used to attract jaguars. In August, the tigress killed three people around the town of Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district and left more than 5,000 residents fearing for their lives. Locals were concerned the cubs might have tasted human blood, although Mr Misra said this was unclear. ""Once they are captured, the relevant authorities and personnel will meet and decide how and where these cubs will be rehabilitated,"" Mr Misra said. India is home to 60% of the world's wild tigers. There are more than 200 in Maharashtra, but only a third live in the state's 60 protected areas, including sanctuaries, natural parks and tiger reserves. Conservationists say their natural habitats are shrinking because of human encroachment. Human-wildlife conflict is seriously on the rise in India. Government figures show that every day one person is killed by elephants or tigers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Post-primary transfer included in NI education review,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The review will also consider what a ""single education system"" would involve. An independent review of education was promised as part of the New Decade New Approach (NDNA) deal. The executive has now agreed the terms of reference for the review, which will be carried out by a five-person panel. However, the panel is yet to be appointed and the review is not expected to begin until May 2021. The NDNA deal said the way education is run in Northern Ireland - with a range of sectors and school types - was ""not sustainable"" and promised a ""fundamental review"" as a basis for change. The review is to consider pre-school, primary, post-primary and special education as well as youth services. According to the just-published terms of reference, it will have three strands. These include a child's ""journey"" through education, how schools are run and funded and how Northern Ireland's education system operates. Although academic selection is not specifically mentioned in the terms of reference, the review is to consider ""the transition and transfer of children from primary to post-primary"". The 2021 transfer tests used by many grammar schools to select pupils are due to begin in early January. The review will examine how much duplication and segregation is involved in education in Northern Ireland and what this costs. It will also define what a ""single education system"" would mean, and look at how this could operate in practice. A DUP assembly member on Stormont's Education Committee, Maurice Bradley, recently said that all schools in Northern Ireland should be integrated. Support for children with special educational needs, which has been the subject of a number of critical reports in recent years, is another area the review panel will be asked to consider. The review is wide ranging and expected to cost about £270,000. The panel is expected to take 18 months to deliver a final report. The report will ""set out a clear vision of what high quality and innovative education in Northern Ireland should look like in the 21st century, the outcomes it should deliver and the appropriate indicators of success - detailing the key actions required to make this vision a reality"". However, it will be up to a future executive to decide which, if any, of its recommendations should be implemented. Education Minister Peter Weir said that the review should be approached ""with open minds"". He said: ""It will be based on evidence; learn from best practice locally and elsewhere; and, be informed by the voice of stakeholders including children and young people."" The review has been welcomed by the Alliance Party's education spokesperson, Chris Lyttle, who said it was needed to see whether Northern Ireland's education system was ""fit for purpose"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nil-by-mouth case family in Salford hospital legal action,"Marion Sampler, 80, died as a result of ""a failure in basic care"" at the hospital last October. Initially her family were happy with staff and sent a card and chocolates to thank them. But an inquest found she died from an infection after accidentally inhaling food or liquid. The trust apologised. Mrs Sampler, of Ordsall, died at the hospital three weeks after being admitted with unexpected weight loss. Her family believed she was well cared for as they were unaware she had been given food by mistake. At an inquest in January, the coroner at Bolton Coroner's Court certified she had died from aspiration pneumonia after food material and liquid were given to her by mouth ""in circumstances where a documented direction of nil by mouth was not followed"". Katie Nolan, a specialist medical negligence solicitor at Manchester-based JMW Solicitors, said: ""Marion was an active 80-year-old who was still enjoying life with her family. ""However, once under the care of Salford Royal Hospital, she deteriorated rapidly and died in distressing circumstances. ""This is an unacceptable failure in basic care and it is crucial that Marion's family understand how this was allowed to happen and receive assurances that safeguards have been put in place to prevent it from happening again."" 'Never allowed to happen' Mrs Sampler's son-in-law Steven Cooper, also from Ordsall, said: ""We feel absolutely devastated about what happened to Marion. ""Although she was 80, she was still getting about and had no problems with her mental function. ""We're talking about a human being here. We just want to make sure this is never allowed to happen to anyone else. ""The last thing she said to me was: 'You're not going, are you sweetheart?' That will stay with me forever."" Salford Royal Hospital has said sorry to the family ""as we acknowledge we have let them down"". Director of nursing Elaine Inglesby-Burke said the hospital prides itself on ""its openness and transparency"" with patients and families. She said: ""Shortly after Mrs Sampler's death a senior consultant met with the family. He apologised and explained the circumstances leading to her death. ""The senior consultant also confirmed that the trust had already proactively referred the matter to the coroner's office for further investigation. ""Although we believe the circumstances were explained as well as they could be, it is clear from the family that all of these issues were either not explained as explicitly as they would have wished or that they were not properly understood.

Cameron to lead China trade delegation,"The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. 'Varied markets' The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. ""I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples,"" he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's ""vast and varied markets"" he said, adding: ""This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come."" Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. Statement delayed The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the ""global economy"" was not a ""zero sum game"". ""As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?'

London 2012: IOC's Oswald urges Olympic ticket 'fraud' bans,"The International Olympic Committee is investigating Sunday Times claims of corruption involving 27 officials and agents representing 54 countries. The most in-demand tickets were said to be priced at up to 10 times face value. ""If you know you are breaking rules and still do it, it is unacceptable,"" said the IOC's Denis Oswald said. More than one million tickets were distributed overseas among all nations taking part in London 2012 but the IOC has strict rules to combat touts. It is the responsibility of individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to make sure its allocation is sold only within its own country. The Sunday Times alleged that agents and officials had been caught selling thousands of tickets on the black market. Responding to the allegation at the weekend, former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell - a member of the Olympic Board that helps to oversee London 2012 - said any tickets known to have been sold at more than face value should be banned. Offending countries should not be awarded tickets in future Games, he added. But Mr Oswald, a former Olympic rower, said that would not be enough. People who were aware they were breaking rules ""should no longer belong to the Olympic movement"", he said. ""It is why it is very serious, especially people in situations where they have responsibilities for their own national sport and are prepared to break the rules."" 'Individual punishment' He said there would be differences between cases ""and you cannot treat everybody the same"". ""But, depending on the result of the inquiry, there could be a sanction that people are no longer accepted in the Olympic movement and therefore they should have no link with sport in their own country."" Mr Oswald, who is also a member of the London organising committee, took part in an emergency IOC meeting in the wake of the Sunday Times' allegations. They follow the resignation last month of a senior Ukrainian official who was filmed by the BBC offering tickets for cash. Mr Oswald, who said he thought there would have been similar cases on a smaller scale at all previous Olympic Games, said only the individuals involved should be punished and not the National Olympic Committees. The issue of sanctions had not yet been discussed by the IOC but it would take the allegations ""very seriously"", he added. He said the IOC would consider a dossier of evidence from the Sunday Times detailing the claims. The paper alleges that it found the corruption after reporters posed as Middle Eastern tickets touts during a two-month investigation. The IOC has said that it moved quickly ""to deal with allegations that some NOCs and Authorised Ticket Resellers have broken rules relating to the sale of Olympic tickets"". ""Should any irregularities be proven, the organisation will deal with those involved in an appropriate manner,"" it added. London 2012 organising committee Locog said none of the tickets in question came from the allocation to the British public.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Taylor Swift's new album Reputation isn't available to stream,"Fans will have to buy a copy of her sixth album before it's made available on services like Apple Music and Tidal. Taylor Swift has criticised streaming companies in the past, calling them ""unfair"" to musicians, and pulled her back catalogue off Spotify in 2014. ""I don't feel [it] fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of music,"" she said. Taylor tweeted a picture of a London bus with Reputation artwork and the caption ""Friday. #reputation"". Bloomberg reported earlier this week that streaming companies are still negotiating with the singer over when they can start offering her album. Taylor Swift has had a difficult relationship with streaming sites and has criticised the effect they're having on the music industry. Her last album, 1989, only returned to Spotify in June as a ""thank you"" to fans after it sold 10 million copies. She limited her tracks on Apple Music after challenging the firm over the fact it wasn't planning to pay royalties to artists during its three-month launch trial period in 2015. In an open letter, she wrote: ""We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation."" In response, Apple reversed its payment policy. Reputation features 15 tracks including a collaboration with Ed Sheeran and US rapper Future on the track End Game. Taylor Swift's representatives haven't replied to a BBC request for comment about when fans will be able to access Reputation on streaming sites. A smart business move By Sinead Garvan, Newsbeat entertainment reporter It's not come as much of a surprise that Taylor Swift's sixth album Reputation hasn't appeared on any streaming platforms. There were plenty of reports this week that it would stay off those sites to start with. According to numerous reports, streaming executives have been told they must wait a week, while retailers were initially told the album would not go on streaming sites for two weeks. This is simply a smart move if you want huge first week sales figures. Adele kept 25 off streaming services for seven months - she sold more than three million albums in the first week. It's unlikely Taylor will break that record but early predictions from pre-orders would suggest she will hit the million mark in the first week, beating 1989. Most people on social media suggest they're happy to buy a hard copy of Taylor Swift's new album or download it. US actor Colton Haynes was very excited about the release of the album. Natalie's happy to buy it so she can listen to it now. But some people are refusing to buy Reputation. Tori says she won't be purchasing a physical copy. And Melina thinks Taylor Swift not putting her album on streaming services will just push people to download it illegally.

Cwm Taf maternity: Review of midwife report handling,"Its chief executive, Allison Williams, said it was ""not handled in line with recognised and usual"" processes. The report's existence was only discovered when an independent review team went in late last year. It found services ""dysfunctional"" and the health board heard ""significant work remains to be done"". It is a month since the publication of the damning report into maternity services at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The review by two royal colleges heard that mothers who came forward with concerns were ignored or made to feel worthless. In a board meeting in Abercynon, the chief executive confirmed that an external review had started to look at the handling of an internal report by a consultant midwife. The report highlighted many safety concerns last September but was not acted upon. The royal colleges review said it was ""dismayed"" at the lack of action, ""thereby continuing to expose women to unacceptable risks"". Ms Williams said: ""The needs of women and their families must be central to everything that is done to address the failings in maternity services."" She also revealed since the end of April, 39 women or their families have contacted the health board via its dedicated contact line or email asking for advice or for their care to be reviewed. Health Minister Vaughan Gething put Cwm Taf maternity services into special measures following the review and appointed the head of an independent panel to oversee improvements. On Wednesday, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council leader, Andrew Morgan, called on Ms Williams to consider her future in light of the failings. The health board - which handles 3,700 births a year - said it accepted all of the findings and ""apologised unreservedly"" for the distress caused to families affected, adding that it was ""absolutely committed to putting right the very serious concerns identified by the review team."" The independent panel will pick up the review of 43 cases between 2016 and September 2018, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths. It is expected to look back at another six years of cases and potentially another two years beyond that. It has already emerged that there were 67 stillbirths that will be examined.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK trade deficit biggest since 2008 in first quarter,"The gap between imports and exports for the first three months of 2016 stands at £13.3bn, up from £12.2bn in the fourth quarter of 2015, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Analysts said this was more evidence of the weight of global economic weakness on the UK. One described the figures as ""truly horrible"" UK economic growth has already slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter. The ONS said the UK trade gap widened over the quarter because of a £1.9bn rise in imports such as mechanical machinery, cars, clothing, jewellery and footwear. Meanwhile, exports increased by just £500m, led by chemical products. ""A truly horrible first-quarter trade performance that clearly weighed down on GDP growth,"" said Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight. He added that UK exports had been hampered by moderate global demand as well as sterling's strength in 2015, particularly against the euro. ""The hope has to be that UK exporters will increasingly be helped by the overall marked weakening of the pound in 2016, although the pound has climbed off its April lows,"" he continued. 'Unacceptably large' Within this period, there was a slight improvement in March's numbers, with the deficit narrowing by £0.5bn to £3.8bn. But the British Chambers of Commerce, a business group, said this was little cause for comfort. ""In spite of the small improvement seen in March, the UK's trade deficit worsened over the quarter and remains unacceptably large,"" the group said. Last month, figures showed that economic growth in the UK had been hit by a drop in manufacturing and construction output. Last week, the closely watched Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) added to those concerns by indicating that UK growth was ""near stalling"". Chris Williamson from Markit, which compiles the PMI reports, said: ""The weakness of exports is by no means severe but is just one of many headwinds acting against the UK economy at the moment, compounding growing uncertainty at home due to referendum worries."" German surplus Meanwhile, Germany's trade surplus hit an all-time high in March as its exports surged, according to monthly data published by the federal statistics office Destatis. Exports grew 1.9% while imports fell 2.3%, pushing the surplus to €23.7bn from €20bn in February. On the negative side, industrial output contracted in March, suggesting that overall economic growth in Germany could be beginning to slow. However, looking forward, economists at Capital Economics predicted that global growth would pick up, which would in turn boost demand for UK goods. ""But for now, the responsibility for driving the recovery lies with the domestic services sector,"" the note added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poppers manufacturer 'will fight' legal high ban,"By Kevin CoreYou and Yours, Radio 4 John Addy, 67, who used to run a gay nightclub in Huddersfield, told Radio 4's You and Yours he was inspired by Tory MP Crispin Blunt's admission in a Commons debate that he uses poppers. The drug, which is popular with gay men, is to be banned on 1 April under the Psychoactive Substances Bill. Policing Minister Mike Penning said the medicines regulator was reviewing it. Speaking about Mr Blunt's intervention in the Commons, Mr Addy, who runs the firm Liquid Gold, said: ""Until now we've stayed in the background to see what was going to happen. ""But when he made that statement I thought we make the product and we should give him all the support we can."" Mr Addy, who previously ran the Gemini nightclub, said he noticed clubbers would bring the liquid in having got it from pharmacists. When he sold the club in 1981 he went into business manufacturing them to other gay clubs, but now Liquid Gold trades across Europe to wholesalers. What are poppers? What are poppers? In 1999, the Medicines Control Agency brought a test case against manufacturers on the basis that poppers containing isobutyl nitrite were medicines, and therefore required a product licence for sale and supply in the UK. The case was not successful and the defence sufficiently argued the products did not cause significant harm. Mr Addy said: ""This was an important test case and a five-day trial. The evidence was put forward to the jury. ""They came back with a sensible answer and that's why I'm surprised this has surfaced at the moment."" He has called on the government to consult with him, and is now in discussions with his lawyers over the April ban. An amendment excluding poppers from the new Psychoactive Substances Bill was defeated in the House of Commons. Policing Minister Mr Penning said poppers had been mentioned on 20 death certificates since 1993. 'Cat and mouse game' In a statement to Radio 4, Mr Penning added: ""The landmark Psychoactive Substances Bill will fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances - and put an end to the game of cat and mouse in which new drugs appear on the market more quickly than government can identify and ban them. ""We will work with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and others on the evidence for the use of poppers and we intend to respond before the summer recess.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Mr Putin has previously voiced hopes that the Trump administration will help improve US-Russia relations. During the election campaign, Mr Trump called Mr Putin a better leader than US President Barack Obama - a remark which drew criticism in the US. Mr Putin told the TV channel: ""Trump was an entrepreneur and a businessman. He is already a statesman, he is the head of the United States of America, one of the world's leading countries. ""Because he achieved success in business, it suggests that he is a clever man. And if he is a clever man, then he will fully and quite quickly understand another level of responsibility. We assume that he will be acting from these positions."" Trump: Putin a better leader than Obama Russian media's love affair with Trump Why Russia is celebrating Trump's win Germany spy boss warns of Russian vote hacking On 1 December, Mr Putin told Russia's political elite: ""We don't want confrontation with anyone. We don't need it. We are not seeking and have never sought enemies. We need friends. ""We are ready to co-operate with the new US administration. We have a shared responsibility to ensure international security,"" he added. Addressing Russia's relations with the West, Mr Putin told NTV that attempts to create a unipolar world - in which one state has economic, military, and cultural dominance - had failed. Russia's leader has often used the phrase to accuse the US of trying to dictate global affairs. Mr Trump's stance on Russia was heavily scrutinised throughout his presidential campaign, and he has made clear that he respects Russia's leader. Speaking in September, he said Mr Putin had ""great control over his country"" and called him a better leader than President Obama. Mr Trump noted that the Russian had ""an 82% approval rating,"" adding: ""I think when he calls me brilliant I'll take the compliment, ok?""

EU court orders Poland to halt court retirements law,"The European Court of Justice upheld the request by the European Commission and the head of Poland's ruling party said it would comply with the decision. The Polish government has been accused of trying to appoint loyal judges. But Warsaw argues the reforms, which lower the retirement age from 70 to 65, make the court more efficient. Poland has clashed with EU bodies in recent months over a number of issues. ""We are members of the European Union and we will abide by European Union law,"" said the head of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), Jaroslaw Kaczynski, adding that Poland ""had the right to appeal"". What did the ECJ ruling say? The Luxembourg-based court ordered Poland to immediately reinstate the Supreme Court judges who have been forced to retire since the new law came into force in July. The ECJ said its decision was an interim measure in response to a European Commission request, and a final ruling would be issued at a later date. Poland has yet to make a submission in the case. About a third of the judges have stepped down, but Chief Justice Malgorzata Gersdorf - who is also affected by the changes - is refusing to quit, saying the Polish Constitution guarantees her a six-year term. Fines could be imposed if Poland is found in breach of EU law. How did the Polish government react? The judicial reforms triggered mass street protests across Poland. Opponents say the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party will use the law to appoint new judges loyal to the authorities. The conservative government denies the accusations, saying the country's judiciary was not properly reformed after the end of communism in 1989. After Friday's order, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said ""several possibilities will be analysed"" - without giving details. Poland and the EU's tug-of-war By the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw The European Commission was so alarmed about the law's damage to Poland's judicial independence that it asked the court to impose interim measures before the case has even been heard. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, widely considered the country's most powerful politician, insisted Poland would exercise its right to appeal. In fact Poland has no such right to appeal. What it will most likely do is argue that the changes do not contravene EU law, as the European Commission alleges, once the court hears the case. When the ECJ eventually hears the case, Poland will argue that the changes do not contravene EU law, as the European Commission alleges. Mr Kaczynski did not make it clear whether the retired judges would be reinstated in the meantime, as the court ordered, or only after the final ruling should it lose. President Andrzej Duda, a former Law and Justice MP and ally, has appointed 27 new judges to the Supreme Court. However, they will mostly fill positions in two newly-created Supreme Court chambers, rather than replace the retired judges, which could make it simpler to reinstate the latter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UKIP AM Michelle Brown faces committee over racial slur,"Michelle Brown was recorded making the comment about Chuka Umunna in a telephone conversation with an adviser. She has already accepted her language was ""inappropriate"" and has apologised. If the committee recommends a sanction - which could range from a reprimand to a suspension - there would be an assembly vote on it. The cross-party standards of conduct committee is considering a report on the matter written by the Standards Commissioner Sir Roderick Evans. Ms Brown and UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday. If the commissioner has concluded Ms Brown broke the code of conduct governing AMs' behaviour, the committee will then decide whether to recommend she is sanctioned. Ms Brown, a north Wales regional AM, called the Mr Umunna a ""coconut"" during a conversation in May 2016 with her then senior adviser, Nigel Williams. She was also recorded using an abusive remark about Tristram Hunt, who was then Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central. Mr Williams, who was her senior adviser for 12 months, was sacked by Ms Brown in May 2017. The Labour chair of the committee, Jayne Bryant, did not take part in proceedings on Tuesday because her party made the original complaint. When the recording came to light in July 2017, Ms Brown said: ""The point I was making is that because of his considerable wealth and privilege, Chuka Umunna cannot possibly understand the difficulties and issues that the average black person faces in this country any more than I can, and I stand by that assertion. ""I do however accept that the language I used in the private conversation was inappropriate and I apologise to anyone that has been offended by it. ""As far as the language I used about Mr Hunt is concerned, it was a private conversation and I was using language that friends and colleagues often do when chatting to each other.""

Using national child poverty statistics, it extrapolated its figures and estimated there could be hundreds of thousands without beds. The charity has written to politicians in 10 areas of high deprivation asking them to help resolve the issue. Sarah Khan, a single mum from Bradford in West Yorkshire, was given a bed by the charity for her four-year-old son Mikhail after he had been sleeping in hers alongside her. ""He was keeping me up all night kicking, and I was surviving on just two hours' sleep, so obviously I was getting poorly myself,"" she said. ""I was walking around half asleep most of the time, I was struggling to eat because I was so tired. ""In 2018 you shouldn't have to choose whether to feed your kid or wash their clothes, the reality is we're having to choose."" The letter from the charity's chief executive to MPs and council leaders in 10 local authority areas with high levels of deprivation said the UK's social safety net was ""fraying"". Gerri McAndrew also called for discussions between the charity and local authority leaders to ""address the situation"". She wrote: ""We are seeing increasing evidence amongst those we support that the changes to the welfare system of recent years are increasing the financial pressure they are already under. ""While we understand that public funds are stretched, we expect every local authority to commit to ensuring that no child in their area will sleep without a bed of their own."" Local authority areas contacted by Buttle UK and number of beds distributed in 2017-2018: The charity has provided more than 13,500 beds to children in the past five years, with staff experiencing a rise in demand over that time period. Olu Alake, director of grant programmes and project development for Buttle UK, said: ""Not having a bed means you don't get a good night's sleep, not having a good night's sleep means you can't concentrate properly in school. ""It means that your self-esteem is eroded because you can't bring friends back to your home, and that's such an important part of childhood."" The government said its programmes were targeting support in ""some of the poorest areas of the country"". ""Welfare reforms offer parents tailored support to move into work, ensuring that even more families can receive the benefits that work can bring, and as well this we are spending £90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most,"" a spokesperson said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gove urges teachers to call off strike,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent The National Union of Teachers is staging a walk out which is expected to disrupt schools in England and Wales. Mr Gove said they should ""stand up for education"" rather than ""standing up for their own pay and pensions"". NUT leader Christine Blower says teachers ""deeply regretted"" striking but there had been no ""serious negotiations"" in talks with government. The strike by teachers, over pay, pensions and workload, is taking place alongside walk outs by other public sector unions. Pay and pensions Mr Gove's comments on the NUT strike are to be delivered at an international conference on education reform in London on Thursday. ""So to those striking today - to those walking out of classrooms to take to the streets - I urge them to reconsider,"" Mr Gove will say. ""The unions, in the past, have claimed to 'stand up for education'. Today they're standing up for their own pay and pensions. ""I urge them to join all of us in this hall, all of us who are really standing up for education - putting education first and foremost - and the education of our most deprived children most of all."" But Ms Blower says teachers are being forced into going on strike because the government had failed to engage with their concerns, including disputes over performance pay and excessive workloads. ""We are aware that this causes problems and disruption for parents and carers. ""However, despite months in talks with government officials, the real issues of our dispute over pay, pensions and conditions of service have not been addressed."" Mr Gove's speech to the Education Reform Summit will be made alongside education ministers and experts from the US, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal and Poland. The conference will draw upon international examples of how education systems can be improved. Mr Gove will say that in England the ""status quo"" is not good enough. ""Of course, any change to the status quo is difficult. Of course, people can be more frightened of what might be lost than inspired by what might be gained. ""But for years, for decades, our status quo has simply not been good enough. We can't and we mustn't keep going backwards - and failing the poorest above all."" He will say a ""world class education"" system would include more pupils taking core subjects at GCSE, collaboration between schools and a ""drastic reduction in levels of illiteracy and innumeracy"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Motorcyclists targeted in road safety drive,"Nearly 70 bikers were killed or injured in Powys in 2011 along with 53 in Carmarthenshire and 51 in Swansea. They accounted for 37% of the people killed or seriously injured despite making up only 1% of the traffic. Transport Minister Edwina Hart said mid Wales had a ""disproportionate"" casualty rate. The quiet, rural roads of Powys are known to attract visiting motorcyclists from the midlands and south Wales, especially on summer weekends. There have been a variety of safety campaigns by the police and councils in Wales over the years to try and cut death and injury rates. ""Motorcyclists are amongst the most at-risk groups of road users in Wales,"" said Mrs Hart. ""We have not seen a significant reduction in casualty numbers amongst motorcyclists over the last decade, in contrast to the reductions amongst other groups of road users. This is not something that I consider acceptable."" In Powys, 68 motorcyclists were killed or injured in 2011, with 51 of the incidents involving bikes with over 500cc engines, according to the latest available statistics. ""Mid Wales does have a disproportionate number of motorcyclist road casualties,"" added Mrs Hart. ""Statistical analysis has shown that these tend to be male riders on powerful bikes, during the drier months of the year. ""We will continue to work with Dyfed Powys Police and other partners through Operation Darwin which targets these riders to educate them about the importance of safety and, where appropriate, enforce the law."" Other areas of Wales with worrying crash rates include Carmarthenshire, which had 53 motorcycle casualties in 2011. Swansea had 51, Cardiff 43, Denbighshire 38, Flintshire 36 and Gwynedd 35. 'Cause for concern' Mrs Hart said some of the £6m road safety funding would be used to fund advanced rider training courses, practical safety advice, targeted publicity and engineering schemes. ""I will also soon publish our road safety framework,"" said the minister. ""The consultation document highlighted the vulnerability of motorcyclists, included a specific target for casualty reduction amongst this group and placed an onus on partners to actively engage with riders."" Montgomeryshire's Conservative AM Russell George hopes Powys council will receive a significant share of the road safety funding. ""I welcome the statement from the minister, particularly highlighting the real problem of motorcyclist road casualties that exists in mid Wales,"" he said. ""It's a real cause for concern."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams, AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, said: ""We all have a part to play in making our roads safer. ""I will continue to work with Welsh government, Dyfed Powys Police and all road users to try to achieve this.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Smear tests should be offered at 16 says mother of victim,"19 year-old Sophie Jones from the Wirral died at the weekend from the disease. She hadn't been tested for cervical cancer because doctors thought she was too young. Sophie's mum Peri Cawley has spoken to Newsbeat about a campaign the family is now launching - to get better access to screening for women Sophie's age. Peri describes Sophie as a ""bubbly, livewire that was the glue of our family."" A year ago Sophie was like any other 19-year-old, she loved going out and wanted to be a model. Peri said that Sophie began having symptoms similar to those seen in cervical cancer at the beginning of last year. 'Crohn's disease' ""Sophie first went to the doctor in February last year, she has severe stomach pains and she had vaginal bleeding,"" Peri said. The doctors believed Sophie had Crohn's disease. That was not the case and by November 2013 Sophie was diagnosed with cervical cancer. It had already spread to other parts of her body and she died early on Saturday (15 March). Sophie's family and friends have now set up an online petition to get better access to screening for women Sophie's age, so far it's received just under 150,000 signatories. ""We want to make it so its so big so people really do listen,"" said Peri. ""[The petition] is not saying that at 16 everybody universally should be called in for a smear. We're saying if you go to a GP and you present symptoms similar to cervical cancer then you should be able to be screened rather than it just be dismissed because you're a certain age."" The NHS routinely screen women over 25 in England and in Scotland it's women over the age of 20. But after Sophie's case they say they would urge any women under the age of 25 who have concerns to speak to their GP. Peri admits that there are no guarantees that Sophie would have survived if she did have the tests but added: ""Had [Sophie] have been given the option to choose to go for these tests then she might haven been able to be treated.""

Restaurant insolvencies jump as diners stay at home,"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News Accountancy firm Moore Stephens said there had been 1,219 insolvencies, ranging from standalone restaurants up to large investor-backed chains - up from 985 in 2017. It blamed overcapacity at a time when Britons are eating out less. Restaurant critic Jay Rayner said more operators could struggle next year. In 2018, a spate of big restaurant chains were forced to strike rescue deals - known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) - with their creditors as they faced unsustainable debts. Gourmet Burger Kitchen earmarked 17 sites for closure while Carluccios is shutting 34 outlets. Prezzo said it would close 94 - about a third of the chain - including all 33 outlets of its Tex-Mex brand Chimichanga. Moore Stephens said that insolvencies were at their highest level since it began tracking the sector in 2010. It blamed an influx of private equity investment that had led to some restaurant chains opening too many sites that were now failing to break even. It also said interest rate rises and Brexit concerns had ""put a dent"" consumer spending growth, as operators faced rising overheads such as the minimum wage and ingredient costs. 'Stalled' Head of restructuring and insolvency Jeremy Willmont said: ""Restaurants have always been prone to high failure rates but vacant restaurants used to be rapidly replaced by a new contender. For now, that process seemed to have stalled and many sites are empty. ""Under such tough trading conditions, restaurants should be cautious about building up debt. They can very quickly become overextended as costs continue to rise."" Restaurant critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that many restaurants - and particularly mid-market chains - operated on ""extremely tight profit margins"". ""They might be worth a lot but their margins are so tight that they are subject to real pain if there are sudden changes in the market place."" He said that while an independent, standalone restaurant might be able cut its costs and struggle on, investor-backed businesses had to cut their losses fast. ""I don't believe in crystal-ball gazing, but I think the last few months of the year will be good for restaurants, but in January many are going to find themselves staring down the barrel of Brexit. ""I think we could see a lot more businesses go to the wall and a lot of jobs lost.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Public sector hourly pay outstrips private sector pay,"In 2013, average hourly earnings in the public sector were £16.28 an hour, compared to the average £14.16 among private employees. But the difference was skewed because more public sector jobs require high levels of skill and university degrees. Public sector employers also tend to be larger, thus paying higher wages. Stripping out the influence of various job and personal characteristics - not just the effect of jobs requiring high levels of skill or higher educational qualifications, but also factors like age, experience, gender and location of the jobs - then the pay difference in favour of the public sector shrank to between 2.2% and 3.1%. And if the tendency for big employers - those with more than 500 staff - to pay higher wages was also removed, then the balance of average pay moved in favour of the private sector as the public sector is mainly made up of large employers. The ONS said that taking all those factors into account, then the private sector's average weekly pay rates in 2013 were in fact between 1.3% and 2.4% higher than those of the public sector. ""Average pay levels vary between the public and private sectors because of the different jobs and characteristics of the people within each sector,"" said the ONS. ""The average pay difference in favour of the public sector has narrowed since the year 2010, which in part reflects the restraints on public sector pay over this period,"" it said. The top 5% The figures used for the ONS analysis came from its Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, a survey of 1% of all tax returns of people in employment - but not the self-employed. Overtime pay was not included in the public/private sector analysis, and the value of pension contributions, company cars or health insurance are not covered by ASHE anyway. The ONS found that if rates of pay were compared by calculating median pay (the middle pay point of the range of pay rates being sampled), then the superiority of public sector pay was even higher - a 35% difference. That amounted to public sector staff being paid £3.67 per hour more than the private sector's employees. The survey results were not all one-way traffic in favour of the public sector. While those in the bottom 5% of staff in the two groups were paid more if they were in the public sector, the highest-paid earners in each of the two groups were paid more if they were in the private sector. ""Looking at the top 5%, in the public sector earnings are greater than £31.49 per hour, while in the private sector, the top 5% earn more than £33.63 per hour,"" the ONS said. ""The top 1% of earners in the private sector, at more than £60.21 per hour, earns considerably more than the top 1% of earners in the public sector, at more than £49.65 per hour.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Norilsk Nickel: Mining firm pays record $2bn fine over Arctic oil spill,"Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, said it had paid the fine on Wednesday. The fuel spill last May saw 21,000 tonnes of diesel pour from one of the company's storage tanks into rivers and lakes in Russia's Arctic north. It prompted President Vladimir Putin to declare a state of emergency. ""I ask you to ensure that this [money] is used primarily to improve the environmental situation in [the city of] Norilsk itself and the surrounding region,"" President Putin told a government meeting. The penalty is the biggest ever issued for environmental damage in Russia, officials say. Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, was told to pay the fine by a Russian court in February and chose not to appeal. Its net profits for 2020 fell by 39% as a result of the fine, Reuters news agency reported. How did the spill happen? The diesel oil began leaking on 29 May last year. It is thought to have originated from a rusty storage tank at Norilsk Nickel's power plant in Siberia. Investigators believe the tank near Norilsk sank because of melting permafrost which weakened its supports. The Arctic had seen weeks of unusually warm weather - widely believed to be a symptom of global warming - prior to the disaster. The oil contaminated the Ambarnaya river and surrounding subsoil before drifting about 20km (12 miles) north of Norilsk. It then entered Lake Pyasino, which flows to the Kara Sea in the Arctic Ocean. In total, the oil contaminated a 350 sq km (135 sq mile) area. The environmental impact from the spill could last for decades, Russia's Greenpeace climate project manager Vasily Yablokov said at the time. Meanwhile, Oleg Mitvol, the former deputy head of Russia's environmental watchdog, said there had ""never been such an accident in the Arctic zone"". He said the clean-up could cost 100bn roubles (£1.2bn; $1.5bn) and take between five and 10 years. Delays over reporting the spill prompted criticism from President Putin, but Norilsk Nickel said the incident was reported in a ""timely and proper"" way. The fuel spill was followed by a series of smaller incidents in the region, raising criticism of Norilsk Nickel's environmental and safety measures. Norilsk is already a well-known pollution hotspot, because of contamination from the industry that dominates the city. In 2016, Norilsk Nickel admitted that an accident at one of its plants was responsible for turning a nearby river red. The company reportedly plans to spend some $5.5bn on environmental projects by 2030. You might also be interested in:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Business bank: Industry's views,"It is a pet idea of Business Secretary Vince Cable. The project is still being devised, so there are few details yet. But it should dovetail with other recent initiatives, such as the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme. What do business organisations think? Federation of Small Businesses Mike Cherry, national policy chairman, said: ""It is something we welcome being looked at. ""At long last the government is beginning to listen to some of our ideas about getting more finance to the small businesses that need it because the current method is not working. ""First and foremost, it needs to get money to those small businesses that are able to support the repayment of any loans, without necessarily having to rely on capital assets to support it. ""Banks lend primarily on assets. Clearly that has failed."" British Chambers of Commerce The organisation has been lobbying hard for such a bank to be set up. Dr Adam Marshall, policy director at the BCC, said: ""For the next 50 years it could be making an impact on British businesses' growth prospects. ""A business bank would lend, at a fair risk premium, to some of these new and growing businesses. Ultimately a taxpayer guarantee is going to be required. ""You have examples from around the world, such as the US, South Korea, and Germany, where business banks help provide 'patient' capital for growing firms over time, which is longer term than our banks are prepared to provide. ""But we have one word of warning: if ministers believe that a very quick rebadging of government schemes and programmes can then be called a British business bank, that would ruin both the concept and its ability to deliver fundamental change."" British Venture Capital Association Tim Hames, policy director, said: ""As a simple matter of fact it can work, but it is not obvious what route the government as a whole is going to take. ""It depends so much on what the government intends. ""Is this a temporary fill-in for a remediable situation for banks and small businesses, or are we taking a more profound view that unless you have a big state investment bank, you will always be missing something from the equation? ""I fear we may end up with some horrible mess in the middle, in which we neither have a German-style full-blown state investment bank, nor do we have a swift and well-targeted temporary fund which fills the gap while the banking system pulls itself together."" CBI The organisation for larger employers said a direct state lender for business was not necessary. ""The government has introduced a number of funding schemes to assist smaller businesses, so to help them make best use of these, a business bank that acts as a 'one-stop shop' for these initiatives is a priority,"" the CBI said.

Ministers aim to 'rescue' Planning Bill by undoing changes,"Ministers introduced legislation at Holyrood with the aim of streamlining planning and ""empowering communities"". MSPs on the local government committee then made more than 230 amendments to the bill adding in extra powers and responsibilities for planning boards. The government has warned these could ""create millions of pounds of new costs"" and undermine the legislation. Local Government Minister Kevin Stewart said he was now working on fresh changes to ""rescue"" the bill and ""remove unnecessary burdens"" before MSPs vote on it for the final time. But Labour's Monica Lennon said the government's approach was ""timid"" and would ""plan Scotland's future on the cheap"". The Planning (Scotland) Bill was introduced by the government in a bid to overhaul the planning system, to ""strengthen its contribution to inclusive growth, housing and infrastructure delivery and empowering communities"". However, all of Holyrood's opposition parties raised concerns about the original draft of the legislation, calling it a ""missed opportunity"", and set about making widespread changes in the local government committee. More than 230 amendments were passed, many via contested votes which saw the SNP members defeated by the opposition. The changes voted through included: In a new financial memorandum on the bill, the government warned that the changes made by the committee have ""the potential to introduce further delays, costs and uncertainty into the system"", and ""could discourage investment in Scotland"". The memorandum claims the new duties introduced to the bill could increase costs to planning authorities by up to £75m, and cost businesses more than £400m. Mr Stewart said: ""Throughout the stage two process I made it clear that it wasn't simply amendments being added to the Bill, it was added costs, added bureaucracy. ""As things currently stand, we risk losing the savings that could have been achieved through streamlining, and creating millions of pounds of new costs for planning authorities. It is difficult to see who benefits from that. ""Many MSPs have indicated their willingness to work constructively to rescue this Bill, and I am grateful to those who have already engaged with me. Returning this bill to a shape that allows it to support inclusive growth will require co-operation."" However, Ms Lennon said she was ""proud"" of the amendments made, saying the government ""wants to plan Scotland's future on the cheap"". She said: ""Kevin Stewart needs to put his ego aside and think about what our communities need. MSPs challenged him to use planning to improve public health, ensure there are enough GPs, schools etc alongside new homes, and give communities rights and more influence.

Independent student watchdog could keep Tory whip,"By Sean CoughlanFamily and education correspondent Lord Wharton was asked by MPs about a conflict of interest. He said that party whips, who organise how peers and MPs vote, would give him more ""latitude"". ""I can assure you I won't be hesitant to speak out,"" said Lord Wharton. MPs on the education select committee were questioning him in a pre-appointment hearing for the new chair of the OfS, an independent watchdog for higher education in England, representing the interests of students. The job advert for the role offered £59,000 per year for two days per week. Voting and regulating The preferred candidate is Lord Wharton, a former Conservative MP and former manager of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign. David Simmonds, a Conservative MP on the committee, asked Lord Wharton about a potential conflict if he was voting in the House of Lords on legislation in areas on which he would also be regulating. ""You're a Conservative peer - and the question has to be asked: 'Are you going to retain the Conservative party whip or are you proposing to step away from it?'"" asked Mr Simmonds. Lord Wharton said he had an ""open mind"". But he told MPs his party whips in the House of Lords had said ""they would give me more latitude and understand that I may need to vote against or speak against some of the things the party in government could bring forward"". ""I can absolutely assure the committee that I recognise the crucial importance of the regulator being independent."" The OfS is responsible for independently regulating issues such as making sure students get value for money for their tuition fees. These fees are decided by the government, dependent on votes by MPs and peers - and ministers are currently considering a review calling for fees to be reduced. The regulator also considers the quality of what students are offered and fair access. Labour's Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Wharton, while continuing to hold his party's whip on policy issues such as education, could also really be independent as a regulator. ""All I can assure you is that I will be independent and open and say what I think when issues arise. And if that brings me into conflict with government then so be it. And if it doesn't, it doesn't,"" said Lord Wharton. Lord Wharton also suggested that if he became chair of the OfS it would consider whether the process for students seeking tuition fee refunds was ""fit for purpose"". ""I think the truth is that the process currently is bureaucratic and cumbersome and slow,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cigarette packets wash up on Dorset's Chesil Beach,"They began appearing before midday and are thought to come from containers which fell off a cargo ship in the Bay of Biscay during last week's storms. Dorset Police are guarding the two-mile stretch covered by the cigarettes with the UK Border Agency. On Monday police and coastguards removed about 11 million cigarettes washed up in a container at Axmouth beach in Devon. A trail of packets each containing 200 cigarettes, along with individual packets and capsules of what appears to contain tobacco is covering a two-mile stretch of Chesil Beach, from Chesil Cove on Portland to the Ferry Bridge on Portland Beach Road. Dorset Police officers and community safety officers have been at the scene since the morning to deter people from scavenging.

Tata Sons names Natarajan Chandrasekaran new chairman,"The role will be taken by Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who is currently chief executive of Tata Consultancy Services. He will replace Cyrus Mistry, who was suddenly removed from the post in October 2016, in February. Mr Mistry resigned from all boards in December having led the conglomerate for four years. Tata Sons is the holding company for a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to aviation and salt pans. IT outsourcing giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is India's most-valuable company with a market capitalisation of $67bn (£55bn). Mr Chandrasekaran started as TCS chief executive in 2009, having joined Tata in 1987. The board described him as a ""Tata lifer"". He will take over as the executive chairman from 21 February, having been unanimously recommended for the role by the selection committee, the company said in a statement. Analysis: Sameer Hashmi, BBC News The appointment of N Chandrasekaran as the top boss of India's largest conglomerate has not come as a huge surprise. Ever since Cyrus Mistry was fired and a selection panel formed to find his successor, Mr Chandrasekaran has been considered the front runner. He has a proven track record having spearheaded Tata Consultancy Services for the past eight years. The IT service provider grew tremendously both in terms of profits and stature, under his leadership becoming the country's most valuable company. The fact that he has been working with Tata for the past 30 years makes him an ""insider"" - which many believe will help him in running the huge conglomerate effectively. But Mr Chandrasekaran takes charge of Tata at a time when it's facing huge challenges. Cyrus Mistry and Tata Group have been involved in a very bitter, public battle, during which both the sides have made serious but unverified allegations against each other. The events over the past three months have damaged the group's reputation. The other challenge will be to stabilise some of Tata's key businesses including its steel operations in Europe. Mr Mistry's removal in October led to rancorous exchanges between him and Tata's management. In an email to the board Mr Mistry said that he became a ""lame duck"" chairman and alleged constant interference, including being asked to sign off on deals he knew little about. In October, Tata Sons' board set up a five-member selection committee that included patriach Ratan Tata to choose a new chairman within the next four months. Mr Tata took over as interim chairman of Tata Sons. In November, Tata said Mr Mistry had presided over falling income, rising costs and had ""dismantled"" the company's structure.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Hundreds of people attended the Derry and Enniskillen events. At the scene in Derry: 'Get in or get out' By Dean McLaughlin, BBC News NI About 300 people gathered in Derry's Guildhall Square with their umbrellas as the rain poured down. Nurses, teachers, parents and school children sang songs and held placards reading ""we deserve better politics"". One man shouted ""get in or get out"".

They need to listen to us and the poor patients who are suffering."" Aideen Hughes, who helped organise the Derry rally, said she was never interested in politics but is frustrated at the lack of local government. ""It's simply not right that MLAs are still getting paid. That money could be going to many other sectors that need the funds so badly. ""We have the power. We voted these people in. We also have the power to put somebody else in their position."" Mr Quinn said he was delighted with the turnout in Enniskillen.

Canada 'will not back down' over US metals tariffs,"Chrystia Freeland spoke as officials unveiled a C$2bn (US$1.5bn; £1.15bn) package to support the country's steel and aluminium industries. Retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn worth of US products are due to come into effect on 1 July. Ms Freeland said US tariffs left Canada ""no choice"" but to respond. Canada's tariffs target US steel and aluminium products. It also includes items such as yoghurt, ketchup and orange juice, which are made in key political battlegrounds such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. The list of products is intended to match ""dollar for dollar"" the US tariffs, which came into effect on 1 June, Ms Freeland said. ""Our approach is we will not escalate but equally we will not back down,"" she said. 'Too much at stake' The US and Canada are among each other's top trade partners, exchanging nearly US$700bn in goods and services last year. But trade relations between the two countries have grown tense, amid disputes over issues such as lumber, dairy and wine. The two countries, with Mexico, are also locked in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. In May, when the US said it would not extend exemptions from the tariffs to Canada and Mexico, it said those talks were moving too slowly. Ms Freeland said the discussions continue and will heat up again after the Mexican election on Sunday. She said she is confident that ""common sense"" will prevail. ""There's too much at stake,"" she said. 'A good first step' The US is the top foreign market for Canada's steel and aluminium, while Canada is the destination for more than half of US steel exports. In Canada, the steel and aluminium industries employ more than 33,500 people, according to the government. About 6,000 jobs in Canada are at risk due to the US tariffs, the CD Howe Institute has estimated. Ken Neumann, director in Canada for the United Steelworkers union, said the aid package, which includes loan assistance, should help companies, but the support for workers is more ""modest"". The package ""a good first step that will need to be expanded if the trade dispute continues beyond the short-term"", he said. The US is also exposed to thousands of potential job losses, as higher costs for steel and aluminium hurt US firms and trigger retaliation from Canada and elsewhere. In addition to Canada, the European Union and Mexico are among those that have announced tariffs on US goods in response. The Trump administration has said the tariffs are necessary to protect the steel and aluminium industries, arguing that their success is vital to America's national security. Several countries, including Canada, are challenging that rationale with complaints against the US to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Call for rape examinations action in Orkney and Shetland,"Rape Crisis Scotland is calling for specialist facilities to be made available in Orkney and Shetland. Support workers say it would spare victims the ordeal of travelling by boat or plane under police escort. The Scottish government said forensic facilities were being reviewed. Rape Crisis Scotland said the lack of forensic examination facilities in Orkney or Shetland was adding to the trauma women had already suffered. In a statement it said: ""They are advised not to wash, drink or eat before they are examined (as evidence may be lost) before they are taken with a police escort on a passenger flight or ferry to Aberdeen. ""This is a completely unacceptable situation - often, the first thing people want to do after being raped is wash, and the length of delay of having to travel without being able to wash can make an already traumatic situation even worse."" The charity said it was also getting feedback from women about how difficult they find having a male examiner, which is the case in about half of examinations conducted in police stations. ""The very least we should be able to offer survivors in more remote situations is sensitive services that are appropriate without having to travel to the mainland,"" it said. 'Barrier' to justice Shetland Lib Dem MSP Tavish Scott said action was essential. Mr Scott said: ""We want to make it as easy as possible to have a successful prosecution in a potential rape trial based on evidence. ""Having a forensic facility on the islands is essential for rape survivors and women who have been sexually assaulted. ""The reality of having to get a plane or ferry down to Aberdeen in the most horrible of circumstances must be a barrier to anyone thinking of reporting a sexual assault to the police."" The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling the ""heinous crime"" of rape and supporting victims to ensure they are treated with sensitivity when reporting a crime. A spokeswoman said: ""We are taking bold steps to improve the way the justice system responds to sexual crimes and we have committed to reviewing the way forensic examinations are undertaken to ensure they are done sensitively and appropriately. ""We have provided an additional £1.85m for Rape Crisis Scotland to enhance awareness and the specialist support available for survivors of sexual violence. ""We have also committed resources to NHS Scotland to look at forensic examination services currently being provided for victims across the country and tell us where improvements and change is required.""

Avon and Somerset Police officer sacked after sexting on duty,"The woman told the Avon and Somerset police officer she had been raped, was in therapy and had been sectioned. The officer, identified as PC Y, denied gross misconduct, saying he believed her rape claim was ""sexual fantasy"". The misconduct panel chair Alex Lock said the allegations would ""undermine trust in the police"" and dismissal was the only appropriate outcome. The panel said PC Y, who joined the police in 1996, abused his position when he revealed to the woman he was a police officer and sent her a photo of himself in uniform to gain her trust. Representing Avon and Somerset Police, Briony Ballard said even one instance of an officer abusing his position for sex was ""a betrayal"". 'Lost all desire' Ms Ballard told the panel the officer only ""heard what he wanted to hear"" so he could pursue a sexual encounter. PC Y met the woman on the website Fab Swingers. ""The officer knew what he was doing was wrong,"" Ms Ballard said. ""If you have 20 years' experience, you should be able to know who is vulnerable."" The officer said upon meeting the woman, he ""lost all desire"" but felt he could only leave after sex. Ms Ballard said: ""She told you she had previously been raped. She reported being in therapy for that rape. ""She had potential involvement with the mental health team, and had potentially been sectioned. ""You ignored all of that and put it in the 'doesn't apply to me' box because you saw it as a fantasy."" 'Personal advantage' PC Y replied: ""It sounded like a fantasy. If this was face to face I would've had nothing to do with her. I would've safeguarded her. ""It wasn't about her. It was about meeting someone for a non-committal relationship, nothing else."" Defending PC Y, Ramin Pakrooh said it was ""not strange"" for the pair to want to get to know each other and that sending ""short sexts"" while on duty was not the same as ""chipping off"" work to have sex. But Mr Lock said: ""He used his status not for a legitimate policing purpose but to gain a personal advantage. ""The conduct, taken together, amounts to gross misconduct.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"West Wales health board cannot find dentist for 4,000","The NHS dentist in Adpar, near Newcastle Emlyn, Ceredigion, retired in February and an interim replacement service was set up in Cardigan. Hywel Dda Health Board says the interim service has since been withdrawn due to ""recruitment issues"". Many areas of Wales have suffered from a dentist shortage, with hundreds queueing for hours to register. Carmarthen East & Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards called for a ""permanent solution"". In March, the Patients Association said ""innovative"" NHS management had helped improve the situation for many. The charity noted the Hywel Dda Local Health Board had seen 40,000 extra patients register with an NHS dentist since 2006. The health board has now said the interim NHS dental service begun in April at the Integrated Dental Holdings practice in Cardigan had been withdrawn. It said it was working to reinstate dental services as close to Adpar as possible since the previous practitioner retired and closed the practice. It added that no-one should be in dental pain as additional practice sessions had been put on in Cardigan and Whitland while a permanent replacement was sought. Mr Edwards said his predecessor as MP, Adam Price, as well as local AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas, had been campaigning on the issue. 'Additional dentist' He said: ""We just need some clarity. The situation arose because the dental practitioner in that part retired. ""There were interim arrangements but they seem to have fallen by the wayside. ""You are talking about a pretty large catchment area and the authorities need to provide some detail about what's going to happen from here on in. ""We expect a permanent solution for the communities of the Teifi valley."" Hywel Dda Health Board said in a statement: ""Unfortunately, we regret that despite great efforts, Integrated Dental Holdings has been unable to recruit an additional dentist to provide the temporary service for former Adpar patients. ""The health board has been working extremely hard to put in place alternative arrangements, whilst a long-term solution is put in place. There is no need for any patient to be in dental pain, as urgent care will be provided. Dental nurse ""Patients have been advised that the health board has bolstered emergency access sessions each day at Feidr Fair Practice, in Cardigan, and Hendy Gwyn in Whitland. "" The health board said there was also capacity in some Carmarthen dental practices for those patients who live closer to the town and were willing to travel. Any patients who need urgent dental care are asked to contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 6010128, where they will be triaged by a dental nurse.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Spina bifida womb op baby back home in Essex,"Bethan Simpson, 26, from Essex, was told her daughter Elouise had spina bifida at her 20-week scan and was advised to terminate the pregnancy. However, she opted for pioneering ""foetal repair"" surgery, which has only been carried out on a few UK women. Two-week-old Elouise ""shows no signs"" of the condition, her mother said. The ""very hungry"" newborn is back at the family's Burnham-on-Crouch home, as the Daily Mail first reported. Mrs Simpson underwent a four-hour operation during which her womb was opened and her baby's bottom exposed, allowing surgeons to ""sew up"" a tiny gap in Elouise's lower spine. She and husband Kieron were advised to terminate the pregnancy after the condition was diagnosed, but said the decision to opt for foetal repair was a ""no brainer"". ""I couldn't justify terminating a child I could feel kicking,"" the mental health nurse said. The procedure at University College Hospital in London was deemed successful and Elouise was born on 1 April. ""She came out literally kicking and screaming - and peeing all over the place - so she ticked all the boxes,"" Mrs Simpson told the BBC. The family had been warned to ""expect the worst"" but their ""incredible"" baby girl came home a week ago. ""She has slightly enlarged ventricles, which she always did have, but her kidneys, bladder and hips are all normal and she has sensation right down to her toes,"" Mrs Simpson said. ""She's living proof of what this surgery can do. It might not work for everyone but we've been incredibly lucky."" Elouise is on antibiotics ""as a precaution"", her mum said, but ""her baseline is so good the doctor hopes the effects of spina bifida will be minimal"". ""We hope she will learn to walk and talk like a normal baby,"" she added. Mrs Simpson's surgery was funded by a charitable trust set up by the hospital which carried out her surgery and Great Ormond Street. But NHS England has confirmed that spinal surgery for unborn babies with spina bifida will soon be routinely available. Mrs Simpson is thought to be the fourth patient to undergo the surgery in the UK, with the procedure mostly carried out in Belgium and the United States. Spina bifida and foetal repair surgery Spina bifida literally means 'split spine', and occurs when the spinal column and cord are not properly formed in pregnancy (before the sixth week) - leaving nerves exposed. It occurs in around four in 10,000 pregnancies. The cause is unknown, however mothers are encouraged to take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of developing spina bifida in early pregnancy. Babies born with the condition can become paralysed, suffer bladder and bowel problems - and it can affect brain development. It is estimated that about 80% of mothers choose termination when spina bifida is diagnosed, although the condition varies in severity. The delicate surgical procedure involves opening the uterus and closing the gap in the baby's back while they are still in the womb.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Job loss claim over 'deeply flawed' exit plan,"By James WilliamsBBC Wales political correspondent Counsel General Jeremy Miles said the UK government's planned approach ""could result in lost jobs and lost investment in Wales"". Chancellor Sajid Javid MP has vowed to end alignment with EU rules after Brexit. Businesses have warned that the UK government's approach could affect jobs and result in higher food prices. But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Javid said the UK would not be a ""rule-taker"" after Brexit, urging businesses to ""adjust"". He declined to specify which EU rules he wanted to drop, but said some businesses would benefit from Brexit, while others would not. After the UK's departure from the EU on 31 January, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the UK will continue to follow EU rules and contribute to its budget. The UK and EU are set to negotiate a new trading relationship during the transition period. The new European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has previously said the ""more divergence"" from the EU's rule book the ""more distant the partnership"" with the UK will be. Following the Welsh Government's own analysis of the UK government's approach to the next phase of the negotiations, Mr Miles said: ""The evidence is clear that the further the UK moves away from economic integration with the EU, the greater the economic damage. ""The EU has been and will continue to be our most important trading partner and many businesses depend on integrated supply chains across the EU, which require frictionless trade. ""Given the overwhelming importance of the EU to our economy, the UK must prioritise continued barrier-free access to these markets over trade arrangements with other countries."" 'Lost jobs' The Neath AM said the Welsh Government would continue to challenge the approach that puts the freedom to diverge ""above the well-being of the people of Wales"". ""Such an approach would be deeply flawed and could result in lost jobs and lost investment in Wales,"" he added. On Tuesday, assembly members will vote on whether to give consent to the proposed law put forward by Boris Johnson to enact the UK's departure from the EU on 31 January. AMs are likely to withhold consent following the Welsh Government's recommendation that AMs should vote down the Brexit bill. A UK government spokeswoman said: ""International trade negotiations are reserved to the UK government, and we will negotiate on behalf of the whole of the UK. ""We will continue to work closely with all of the devolved administrations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Youth unemployment doubled in East during Covid-19 pandemic,"By Nic RigbyBBC Politics East The number of people aged 16-24 claiming unemployment-related benefits rose from 20,580 to 48,020 between March and December 2020. The biggest percentage leap - at 195% - was in Hertfordshire, BBC Politics East found. Apprenticeships are one route young people can take out of unemployment. Erin Bradshaw, 23, of Surlingham, Norfolk, finished at King's College London with a first-class degree in French and German last year and has been looking for a job ever since. ""I don't know anybody who has found a job since graduating last year. I have a degree in languages and since then I have so far applied for more than 200 jobs,"" she said. ""The vast majority of jobs I haven't heard back from. Some jobs I have had interviews for but at the last step somebody has more experience than me, and these are entry-level jobs. ""Getting a job is the one thing that will allow me to move on. If I get a job I can move into a flat-share. I can leave home."" In the Budget the government announced £126m for the expansion of traineeships in England for the 2021-22 academic year, providing up to 43,000 traineeship placements. This will fund high quality work placements and training for 16 to 24-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training, it said. Employers who hire a new apprentice from 1 April to 30 September will receive £3,000 per new hire. Apprenticeships are popular in the East of England, where 32,300 apprentices started their apprenticeship during the 2019-20 academic year. Poppy Able, an EDF Energy degree apprentice with the engineering department at Sizewell B power station in Suffolk, said she was pleased to take the apprenticeship option. ""I know quite a lot of people who have become unemployed or perhaps furloughed, whereas I am quite secure in my apprenticeship,"" said Ms Able, who had studied Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. Brer Cornish, a fourth-year apprentice at Sizewell B, said: ""I chose an EDF maintenance apprenticeship to have a hands-on job while gaining qualifications at the same time. ""I enjoy the dynamic nature of the job where no two days are the same. The main benefit was to gain skills and an education while I'm earning as well."" Suffolk New College in Ipswich saw a dip in the number of firms taking on apprentices last year, but has seen a resurgence this year. Kate Rupp, from Suffolk New College, said: ""We have had a high demand in construction - in plumbing, engineering, carpentry and joinery. As we re-open the economy there are going to be lots of opportunities for young people.""

Allerdale and Copeland councils nuclear waste response,"The government has announced that district authorities will lead the decision on where to store high level radioactive waste. Copeland and Allerdale councils were previously willing to be considered. However, in January they were over-ruled by the county council, stopping the search for a site going further. The Department for Energy and Climate Change has outlined a new process, which allows communities represented by a district council to participate on their own. It said in a statement: ""This would have a profound and long-term positive economic impact on the area selected for the site, stimulating local businesses, supply-chains, and providing skilled jobs and training opportunities. ""Government will provide a generous community benefits package, potentially through a community fund, to ensure that the strategic national importance of the project is properly reflected at local level."" Councillor Elaine Woodburn, leader of Copeland Borough Council, said: ""As over 70% of the country's higher activity radioactive waste is already located in Copeland, it is clear that the proposals will have an impact on the borough and our residents. ""We will therefore be taking our time to fully understand and consider the process that the government has outlined, before we respond to the consultation."" Lack of 'plan B' Alan Smith, leader of Allerdale Borough Council, said: ""The future of radioactive waste storage and disposal is of great interest to the people of Allerdale. ""We will be taking the time to study the Government's proposals carefully before we respond to the national consultation."" Councillor Stewart Young, leader of Cumbria County Council, said: ""The county council expressed its concerns about the previous process when Cabinet decided in January 2013 not to proceed to the next stage. ""Those concerns included uncertainty on the right for communities to bring the process to a halt if they are not happy, a complete lack of detail about the timing and quantum of any community benefits package, and the lack of a 'Plan B' for more robust interim surface storage plans for the high-level radioactive waste currently kept at Sellafield if a site cannot be found. ""We will be looking closely at these revised proposals to see whether our concerns have been addressed."" It could take up to 15 years for the site-selection process, with construction taking a further 15.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Portsmouth University threatens legal action amid New Theatre Royal plan,"Portsmouth City Council has offered to buy New Theatre Royal and lease it back to its management trust. However, the University of Portsmouth said it was owed more than £600,000 from its previous backing of the venue. Trustees of the theatre said it had been trying to reach an ""amicable solution"" with the university. The theatre has faced financial difficulties having been forced to cancel shows during the pandemic. The city council announced a plan to purchase the New Theatre Royal Trust last month, which it said would allow it to get back on a ""more sound financial footing"". The Grade II listed venue, which originally opened in 1856, would be bought for an undisclosed sum and leased back to the trustees, who would operate it under a similar model used for the Kings Theatre and Guildhall in the city. The university said it had provided grants of over £200,000 and was owned money following a major refurbishment of the theatre, which included building an adjoining university performing arts building. It said it had instructed lawyers to ""take the necessary steps to recover the debt we are owed"". 'Paying off debts' Vice-chancellor Graham Galbraith said theatre's debt ""keeps growing"", but the university had offered to write-off 30% of what it was owed. ""We're concerned about the management of shared space which has never been properly resolved,"" he added. ""We want to make sure the lease arrangement is properly organised so the building can never be sold on as something other than a theatre."" Theatre trustee William Purvis said: ""It's in everyone's interest we get this sorted. We're very happy the council is coming in to purchase the building which will give us the money to start paying off some of these debts. ""We all want the success of the theatre and the performing arts in Portsmouth."" A city council spokeswoman said the dispute was a matter for the theatre and university.

Lancashire councils push ahead for combined authority,"It follows a ""devolution deal"" by the government to give areas like Greater Manchester more powers over how public money is spent. Lancashire council leader Jennifer Mein said talks involved the 12 borough councils as well as unitary authorities Blackpool and Blackburn. It would be biggest change in local government in the county since 1974. 'Strong argument' ""I think everybody has realised we now need to work much more closely together... and the only way it can work is if we still have the same strategic objectives,"" said Ms Mein. The Labour councillor said she would not necessarily be at the helm of the new alliance as the leader would be decided by ""consensus"". Previously, the then Blackburn with Darwen Council leader Kate Hollern said it was working along with the rest of the council authorities to ""explore a number of options for collaboration"" but there were ""no firm proposals"" at that stage. Analysis: Chris Rider, BBC Radio Lancashire political reporter So the heat is on for Lancashire's council leaders, all 14 of them, knowing that if they want to become involved in a combined authority they need to crack on. The carrot being dangled by the government is the promise of more local powers. This will be the biggest change in local government since the county council and two-tier system was established back in 1974. The calm approach of county council leader Jennifer Mein will stand in good stead as the meetings come thick and fast, party differences put to one side. A board representing all councils should enable each one to feel involved. No room for any fall outs. But what will Lancashire's combined authority actually look like? Throughout the difficult economic times I have heard the phrase ""working together"" time and time again. Now it is time to be put into practice, big time. Two-tier system Blackpool council leader Simon Blackburn has said there was a ""strong argument"" for a combined authority. Since 1974, Lancashire County Council has been operating a two-tier system with borough councils where the county council is in charge of major projects. In a combined alliance, each council will discuss and reach agreement on key issues. Combined authorities are supported by the coalition government which has signalled its willingness to give them extra power and responsibility.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Oxford University summer school taster for Welsh students,"By Colette HumeBBC Wales education correspondent Sixth formers who are part of the Seren network will be invited to apply for a place at a four-day summer school at Jesus College, Oxford. They will try out student life and attend lectures in August. The summer school is thought to be the first aimed specifically at Welsh students. Prof Sir Nigel Shadbolt, principal of Jesus College, said he was ""incredibly proud"" of the college's enduring connection to Wales, which goes back to its foundation in 1571. ""This new initiative will help ensure that we continue to welcome future generations of talented Welsh students here in Oxford,"" he said. The Seren network was set up by the Welsh Government two years ago to address the decline in the number of teenagers applying to the UK's top universities, including Oxford and Cambridge. The flagship university access programme now helps to ensure Wales' most able sixth formers have the right support as they apply to university. More than 800 potential students have gathered in Newtown, Powys, for a Seren network conference over the next two days, where they are meeting representatives from UK universities and taking part in workshops and talks. Those attending include Oxford, Cambridge, King's College and Imperial College, London. Minister for Lifelong Learning and the Welsh Language, Alun Davies, said: ""Raising the aspirations and attainment levels of Welsh school pupils to help them reach their academic potential is an ongoing priority for Welsh Government and the Seren network is playing a pivotal role in this ambition. ""Since its inception in 2015, the network has quickly grown to a recognised and valuable vehicle through which some 2,000 of the brightest pupils in Wales are now channelling and honing their academic talents."" The Seren network has 11 hubs across Wales supporting talented Welsh teenagers. It works in partnership with organisations including the education charity the Sutton Trust to identify opportunities and support Seren students as they apply for degree courses at the best universities, not just in the UK but worldwide. Morgan Cronin, from the Merthyr-RCT Seren hub, attended a Sutton Trust-organised summer school at Yale University in the United States and now has an unconditional offer to study there. She said: ""Many Welsh students are put off applying to top universities because they're worried about not being comfortable in an environment where they'll be a minority."" Ms Cronin said Welsh students were able to share their stories of studying at top universities and make prospective students more comfortable.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook sorry for 'white supremacist ad',"By Joe MillerBBC News News site The Intercept was able to launch a promotion aimed at 168,000 users interested in ""white genocide."" Prosecutors believe the conspiracy theory, which claims ""outside forces"" want to exterminate the white race, may have motivated the man who attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue last week. A senior UK MP has criticised Facebook. In a tweet, Damian Collins, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called Facebook's approval of the ad campaign ""appalling and irresponsible"". He added that the Intercept's investigative reporting showed ""how easy"" it was for extremist groups to promote their messages of hate on the social network. ""Once again, the site has only taken action when someone else has brought it to their attention,"" Mr Collins told the BBC. ""The Facebook ad check service is currently operating far below the standards we should expect from a company of that size and wealth."" The Intercept's findings come more than a year after Facebook pledged to prevent advertisers on its platform from targeting anti-Semitic users, in the aftermath of a similar revelation by US media outlet ProPublica. That report found that ads could be bought to specifically target users who described themselves as “Jew haters”, as well as other hateful terms. In response, Facebook said it would add more human reviewers to its advertising system, and said it was ""building new guardrails"" to prevent such occurrences in the future. But just a few days after 11 Jewish worshippers were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue, The Intercept says it was able to start an ad campaign entitled ""White Supremacy - Test"" targeted at users who ""expressed an interest or like pages related to 'White genocide conspiracy theory'"". The news site claims its request to start the campaign was manually approved by a member of Facebook's advertising department. It is unclear how Facebook categorises users, but the 168,000 targeted by The Intercept were not necessarily believers in the conspiracy theory. After The Intercept contacted Facebook for comment, the social media giant deleted the targeting category and apologised. But Facebook stressed that this incident was not similar to the one unveiled by ProPublica, as the ""white genocide"" targeting category was created by an algorithm, not by users. The social media giant is not the only tech firm to have apologised for offensive content on its platform. On Friday, Twitter said it was sorry after the term ""Kill all Jews"" briefly featured on the site's ""trending"" section for users in New York. The phrase was being discussed as it had been scrawled on the walls on a Brooklyn synagogue that was set to host a political talk with Jewish TV star Ilana Glazer.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Michael Nyman composes Hillsborough memorial symphony,"The hour-long Symphony No 11: Memorial is based on music that Nyman was recording on the afternoon of the Hillsborough tragedy 25 years ago. It will be performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Local-born mezzo soprano Kathryn Rudge will sing the names of the 96 Liverpool football fans who lost their lives. They died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 and their families are currently appearing at fresh inquests into their deaths. They are being held in Warrington after being ordered in December 2012, when the High Court quashed the original accidental death verdicts. Nyman said he hopes the work will make ""a small but significant contribution to the healing process still necessary for the families of the lost fans."" The symphony will be performed at Liverpool Cathedral, with the orchestra and Rudge accompanied by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth and Training Choirs, conducted by Josep Vicent. 'Moving tribute' Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the city would ""never forget those who lost their lives at Hillsborough"". ""Memorials are a symbol of our solidarity and support for the families, and Nyman's specially commissioned piece of music will be a moving and unforgettable tribute,"" said Anderson. ""It is certain to be a highlight of this year's Biennial and a fantastic example of art being used to help shine a light on the dignity and bravery of those who have strived for justice for the 96,"" he added. The symphony is inspired by Nyman's piece of music known as Memorial, a funeral march-style piece composed in 1985 - subsequently used in the film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, starring Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren. As a separate project for the Liverpool Biennial, Nyman will create a new film installation entitled Aztecs in Liverpool, including footage collected by Nyman over the past 20 years in his newly-adopted home of Mexico. The 2014 Biennial Exhibition is entitled A Needle Walks into a Haystack and will take place in seven venues across the city, including the Bluecoat and the historic Trade Union Centre on Hardman Street.

Sheen paid tribute, describing the late star as ""an absolute sweetheart, a consummate pro, a genuine friend [and] a shocking and painful loss"". He wrote: ""Berta, your housekeeping was a tad suspect, your 'people' keeping was perfect."" Ferrell, who was known to her castmates as Chatty, earned two Emmy nominations for her role on the series, about hedonistic jingle writer Charlie Harper, his uptight brother Alan, and Alan's son Jake. As well as Sheen, she acted opposite Jon Cryer and Angus T Jones. Cryer remembered meeting her for the first time.

I'm crying for the woman I'll miss, and the joy she brought so many.""

""I love playing women who have the nerve to do things that I don't have the nerve to do, and Berta is certainly one of those,"" said Ferrell. ""Well, she's that person I wish I could be, and someone I think all of us kind of wish we could be: someone who can just say what's on her mind and not worry about it."" Two And A Half Men co-creator Chuck Lorre noted that everybody on the show ""all loved her"". ""Twelve years of highs and lows, and lots and lots of laughter,"" he said. ""Through it all she was a rock. One of the greats. I was privileged to call her a friend.""

European protected status bid for Denbigh plum,"If successful, the Denbigh plum would join Welsh Lamb and Beef with the special status. Officials are applying for the Europe-wide Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status The plum, which used to grow across north Wales and England, has been traced back to the 13th Century. Other products which have PGI status include Stilton cheese, Arbroath smokies and Newcastle Brown Ale and Melton Mowbray pies. 'Long gone' ""The earliest record of fruit-growing in Denbigh is in the 13th Century when the monks at the friary were grafting fruit trees which almost certain included plums,"" said Helen Williams, a BA history graduate from Glyndwr University in Wrexham who has researched the fruit's history. ""The friary is long gone and only ruins remain but it was in Abbey Road in the town and there are still some very old Denbigh plum trees in a garden there which could possibly be the descendants of those developed by the monks."" Ms Williams said fruit orchards would have developed in the area and would have been supplying the markets of Denbigh until Victorian times. ""The first mention of it in literature was in the 1840s but it would already have been very old by then and certainly it was growing in the gardens at (National Trust property) Erddig, near Wrexham, because metal plate labels have been found with Denbigh seedling plum stamped on them."" National food map A dossier about the Denbigh Plum has now been drawn up to apply for the PGI status. It will first be scrutinised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) before it is presented to the European Commission. Ian Sturrock, who grows old Welsh fruit trees - including the Denbigh Plum - commercially, said he did not know of any other native Welsh fruit tree which had the protected status. Success in achieving PGI status for the plum would mean a possibility of more following, he added. The plum will have star billing at the Denbigh Plum Festival next weekend, and event sponsor Mario Kreft, of Pendine Park Care Homes in Wrexham, said it is something to be celebrated.

Group chair Sharon White told the Sunday Times she expected the price pledge to go. The slogan has been in place since 1925. ""The proposition is important because it signifies being fair to society. We're reviewing it to improve it,"" Ms White told the Sunday Times. The department store chain has already announced the closure of eight stores including its flagship Birmingham site which only opened five years ago as it struggles to adapt to the challenges arising from the pandemic. This year between 60% and 70% of John Lewis's sales are expected to be online, compared to 40% last year. Even before Covid-19 hit, the chain, which is run as a partnership, had warned it might not pay the usual staff dividend as competition ate into profits. Ms White told the Sunday Times the chain needed ""more inspiration, surprise, fun"" and that it would compete by ""curating"" items in store better. John Lewis would focus less on women's fashion and get rid of travel and spa services. Instead it would offer more financial, home and garden products, she said. Ms White said she wanted to reaffirm John Lewis's reputation as a socially responsible retailer and ""shout more"" about its values. Price pledge For nearly a century John Lewis has promised to refund the difference in price, to any shopper who could find an item cheaper elsewhere within 28 days. However, the commitment has never applied to sales from internet-only retailers, which have lower costs and often undercut the High Street on price. John Lewis indicated earlier this year it was reviewing the promise. It said ""fair value"" would still be central to its ethos but ""in a more modernised form""; it hopes to have a new slogan in place by October. ""Never knowingly undersold is from another era,"" said Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail marketing agency Savvy. ""She's got to correct the course on that. They'll be out of business if they do that in a world where Amazon change their prices every minute."" The business is also facing challenges in its Waitrose grocery arm. Next month its long-standing link with delivery service Ocado comes to an end at a time when customers are queuing to sign up for online shopping. The scale of the overall challenge should not be underestimated, said Ms Shuttleworth. ""It's the biggest crisis in the history of the partnership... There's got to be some significant changes to make sure it survives for the future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Life Sciences Bridging Fund offers antibiotic 'lifeline',"By Brian MeechanBBC News In the past, many ideas have not progressed because the stage they were at was too early for companies to develop the research. Experts call this ""the valley of death"" for potentially significant initial academic findings. The Life Sciences Bridging Fund, which has been operating for almost a year, has been aimed at getting the best Welsh research through that vital stage. It might then be able to put the work onto a commercial footing, creating businesses and highly-skilled jobs, as well as providing improvements to patient care. The initiative has been operated by the Life Sciences Hub, with £3m funding from the Welsh government. As it develops, the Welsh government could retain some intellectual property rights and a share of any business, meaning it would benefit from successful products. The fund has supported drug discovery, medical devices and vaccines - along with the research of Dr Sharon Huws from Aberystwyth University. She hopes her work on cows' stomachs could help tackle resistance in future and has already seen the benefits of the financing. ""Without this funding, certainly a lot of this would fall by the wayside and you would tend to publish [research] but it wouldn't go any further,"" she said. ""There has been quite a big push to get the government to step in and play a part in this. It's about protecting the public after all. ""We are all at threat because we can't treat these microbes anymore. ""The Welsh government have really pushed this [research] forward. They have provided so many funds through the life sciences network for drugs discovery which has been absolutely pivotal."" Economic viability The development of replacement antibiotics is a major concern in global health. It has been estimated that by 2050, 10 million people every year will die across the world due to resistance. Common infections could kill and many cancer therapies and surgeries which requires antibiotic treatment could be threatened. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, leading pharmaceutical companies called for governments to do more to make it economically viable to develop new antibiotics. Dr Huws said it would be ""naive"" to think researchers could find the ultimate antibiotic that would never generate resistance. ""These bacteria are clever,"" she said. ""But we certainly need some which have reduced incidents of resistance.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
East Kent X-ray need sees Faversham injuries unit close,"NHS chiefs said the current contract for the Faversham unit was due to end. One provider submitted a final bid for a new tender but did not meet criteria. The specification required X-ray services from 08:00 to 20:00, but the sole bidder wanted to send patients to another site, health chiefs said. But patients have claimed the tender was set up to fail. The NHS had 19 expressions of interest. Eight providers attended a tendering event, but only one submitted a bid. Dr Mark Jones, chairman of Canterbury and Coastal clinical commissioning group (CCG), said: ""The bid was discussed by our governing body members who have agreed that, as the proposal does not meet our clinical specification and financial criteria, the CCG is unable to support it. ""As a result, we will not be awarding the contract and regrettably the minor injuries service will cease."" 'Impossible criteria' The CCG said the bidder wanted to send patients needing X-rays to an alternative site because of lack of accommodation to install an X-ray, staffing costs and low activity levels, and in order to meet financial terms. The current provider's contract was due to end in January, but it has been asked to continue services at the minor injuries unit until March while patients adjust. Faversham town mayor David Simmons said: ""People in the town are saying if you set something up with criteria you know are going to fail, you know it's going to fail."" When asked if the CCG had set impossible criteria, he replied: ""I think they probably did."" He added: ""They should reconsider their decision and explore other alternatives rather than just saying it will close."" Mr Simmons, who is also chairman of the Friends of Faversham Cottage Hospital which offered to buy X-ray equipment for the minor injuries unit, said residents feared this was ""the tip of the iceberg"". He said Faversham and Herne Bay outpatient services were also being reviewed. ""It brings into question the viability of Faversham Cottage Hospital itself,"" he said. ""It's going to increase the numbers of people going to A&E. There's a national debate about that at the moment. I'm very upset about it."" Mr Simmons has organised a public meeting on 6 December where the closure of the unit will be discussed. In reply to Mr Simmons's comments, a spokeswoman for the CCG said the criteria could not be changed because it was ""committed to providing patients with affordable, high-quality, and consistent care"". She added: ""As part of this commitment we have agreed a standardised specification for minor injury services. ""We want the same level of service, such as on-site X-ray facilities, to be available to all patients attending minor injuries units across the area."" The spokeswoman also said representatives from the CCG had spent time with Mr Simmons addressing his concerns.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Statute of limitations plan 'unhelpful'- Simon Coveney,"Simon Coveney was giving evidence to an Irish parliamentary committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. He criticised the decision to widen the consultation to include ideas not in the Stormont House Agreement. Mr Coveney said he would speak to NI Secretary James Brokenshire about it. He said the decision had the ""potential to undermine consultation from day one"". Conservative and unionist MPs want a ""statute of limitations"" to prevent security force members being prosecuted for alleged offences from the early years of the Troubles. However, Sinn Féin has expressed concern about the decision to ask the public what they thought about a statute of limitations in consultation about the Stormont House Agreement. 'Maybe they weren't listening' On Brexit, Mr Coveney rejected assertions that the Irish government had been reckless in its insistence that Northern Ireland should continue to implement rules and regulations consistent with the European Customs Union. Mr Coveney said the Irish stance on Brexit has not changed, but some people appear to have had the impression that when Dublin came under pressure, it would back off. ""Maybe they're surprised that's not happening, maybe they weren't listening,"" said Mr Coveney. He said that Dublin is not alone, but benefits from a lot of solidarity from Michel Barnier's EU Brexit taskforce, which is aware of the potential exposure and vulnerability of Ireland in the event of a bad Brexit. Mr Coveney said the Irish government is in almost daily contact with the taskforce. He told the committee, which includes some Northern Ireland MPs as well as Irish parliamentarians, that the UK needs to accept that regulatory divergence between the two jurisdictions in Ireland after Brexit would make north-south cooperation very difficult to implement in practical terms. The Irish foreign minister said that ideally Dublin would like to see the UK become part of an extended and redesigned European Single Market which would deal with both customs and other regulations. Mr Coveney said good progress had been made on the retention of a British-Irish common travel area, but many problems remain regarding the border and continuing north-south co-operation. The minister said it will require ""a lot more work"" over the next three weeks if Dublin is to be part of a decision to enable the UK-EU Brexit talks to move on to trade matters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Prince William and Kate Middleton turn up at Big Weekend,"The pair were in Bangor, north Wales, to watch artists like Florence & the Machine, Ellie Goulding and Tinie Tempah entertain fans at Vaynol Park. After meeting Prince William chart-topping London rapper Tinie Tempah said: ""He was a nice guy. We were just talking and getting familiar. ""It was a real big deal for me."" He added: ""I was a little bit overwhelmed but it was good. We've never met before. He just said he was, 'feeling everything and a big fan of the music'."" Meanwhile, Florence & the Machine brought the Saturday of the festival to a close by topping the bill on the main stage. Florence Welch, headlining her first festival, kicked off a 55-minute set with previous single Dog Days Are Over. The flame-haired singer then went on to play Kiss With A Fist and Drumming Song. Dressed in a floaty, full-length white dress Welch and her band were joined on stage throughout their set by a 30-strong choir. Dizzee's new track Warming the crowd up for Florence's early evening set was rapper Dizzee Rascal, playing the event for the second year in a row after Swindon last year. Performing the majority of his set bare-chested he debuted new track Heavy for the first time alongside Sirens, Dance Wiv Me, Bonkers, Holiday and Dirtee Disco - where he released confetti balls into the crowd. Meanwhile, chart toppers Ellie Goulding and rapper Tine Tempah both played well received sets on the In New Music We Trust stage. The middle of the afternoon also saw performances from Cheryl Cole and Justin Bieber, both enticing large audiences to the big-top main stage. The Girls Aloud star took to the stage at 4.15pm and played a 25-minute set. Speaking from the stage she said: ""What a fantastic crowd we've got here today. Is everybody ready to have fun?"" Her set included singles Fight For This Love, Parachutes and a cover a Owl City's Fireflies, which she first debuted in Radio 1's Live Lounge. Before playing 3 Words Cole, wearing a khaki army dress and silver aviator sunglasses, said: ''Everybody that's in love in here today I want you to turn to your partner and sing this one."" With the gates opening at midday, the day kicked off with performances from the likes of Scouting For Girls, 30 Seconds To Mars and Chipmunk. Sunday's line-up features artists like Rihanna, Pendulum, Biffy Clyro, Pixie Lott and Vampire Weekend.

Kylie Minogue to play Glastonbury's legend slot,"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The pop star will play the coveted tea-time slot on 30 June, following the likes of Dolly Parton and Barry Gibb. ""It will be 14 years since I was originally meant to appear there and so much has happened up to now,"" said the singer on Instagram. ""I can't wait to see you all there to share this special show."" ""We are delighted to announce that Kylie is finally bringing her show to Glastonbury,"" said organiser Emily Eavis. ""We cannot wait."" Kylie was originally supposed to headline the Pyramid Stage in 2004, but had to cancel to undergo treatment. Basement Jaxx stepped in to replace her, and covered her hit Can't Get You Out Of My Head in tribute. Coldplay's Chris Martin, headlining on the Saturday night, also played Minogue's signature song, telling the audience: ""Everyone's paid to see Kylie as well. Shouldn't we remember absent friends?"" Kylie returned to Worthy Farm in 2010 to cameo with Scissor Sisters, but has never played a full set. 'Very emotional' Speaking to the Associated Press earlier this year, the 50-year-old said she'd love to lay the ghosts of 2004 to rest. ""When I was supposed to do it, I think I would have been the first solo female to headline in however many years it was, so I was really proud of that at that time. ""Obviously it didn't happen. So yes, it would be amazing and very emotional to be standing there and doing what I didn't get to do all those years ago, for sure."" Her return comes a year after she headlined Radio 2's Hyde Park festival, and brought Jason Donovan on stage to recreate their 1988 duet Especially For You. While a repeat at Glastonbury is unlikely, the star knows how to put together a crowd-pleasing set; and with 51 hit singles and seven number ones - including Can't Get You Out Of My Head and I Should Be So Lucky - she's bound to draw a huge audience. Kylie will be joined on the line-up by grime star Stormzy, who's been announced as the Friday night headliner. None of the other acts have been revealed at the moment, but rumoured headliners include Paul McCartney, Arctic Monkeys, Madonna and Fleetwood Mac.

Elections 2021: Millions voting in bumper set of polls,"Millions are set to cast a ballot in elections for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd, and 143 councils and 13 mayors in England. A Westminster by-election is also taking place in Hartlepool. Polling stations opened at 07:00 BST and will close at 22:00 BST, with the results expected over several days. Up to 48 million people across Britain are eligible to vote in the bumper set of elections, on what has been dubbed ""Super Thursday"". Some of the polls were due to be held last year but the Covid pandemic forced their delay, meaning more than usual are taking place this time. Voters in England and Wales will also select 39 police and crime commissioners and voters in London will choose who sits in the London Assembly.

Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster' Polling stations are observing strict Covid protocols, including the frequent cleaning of booths. Social distancing will be in place, and voters are being encouraged to bring their own pencils for completing ballots. Voters who registered to do so can also return their ballots by post, or have a nominated person vote on their behalf (proxy voting). Those who have to self-isolate because of Covid have until 17.00 BST to apply for an emergency proxy vote. The Democracy Club group - which encourages voting - says more than 35,000 venues across Britain will serve as polling stations. These include more than 50 restaurants and cafes, 30 museums, 120 cricket clubs and pavilions and 13 boxing clubs. When will the results be known? Some counting will take place overnight on Thursday, including for the Hartlepool by-election, where a result is expected in the early hours of Friday. Results for all 60 seats in the Welsh Senedd will be known on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on that day, but there will not be a final result until Saturday, or possibly Sunday. Counting in council areas in England will take place on Friday, and continue over the weekend in some areas.

Syria air strikes: For and against UK action,"'We need to end IS's control of its territory' Alan Mendoza, executive director of think tank the Henry Jackson Society ""The UK is already engaged in air strikes against IS in neighbouring Iraq. But some of the major IS command and control points are located within Syria. For us to take an arbitrary approach when IS itself does not take account of this border when pursuing its nefarious activities means that our campaign against it cannot be as effective as it would be with full freedom of manoeuvre. Strategically, we need to end IS's control of its territory in both Iraq and Syria in order to drive it back into the shadows from where it emerged. We cannot do that by only air striking in Iraq. Equally, we have important allies who are engaged in Syria against IS. We face the same threat from IS as they do - as seen with tragic such consequences in Paris - and for us to stand aside while they carry the full burden of responsibility in fighting it would be morally shameful. Operationally, UK strikes are likely to be limited in impact, as we would simply be one component of a larger strike force. However, collectively, the strike force will have the capability to degrade and destroy IS units and infrastructure and weaken its ability to control its territory. As this is a prerequisite for beating IS, we will therefore be making an important contribution."" 'Actions have consequences' Peter Ford, former UK ambassador to Syria ""The added value of UK air strikes in Syria will be piddling - IS leaders have mostly moved to Mosul or are hiding among the civilian population - and because British people will die and be maimed as a direct result. Labour MPs planning to vote for bombing should pause to consider the effect on their careers of exposing themselves to recrimination from the families of the soon-to-be bereaved after we see carnage on our streets. The government are being economical with the truth about already being targeted by IS: they don't say the seven thwarted attacks were actually ""by"" IS but ""linked to"" or ""inspired by"". Weasel words. If the government was sure of its legal case, why is it unwilling to seek an unambiguous UN Security Council resolution? Because it knows it would not pass. Bombing in Syria - where a complex multi-sided conflict is going on - is different from bombing in Iraq, where we are supporting an elected government. Also because actions have consequences and the inevitable blowback on our streets will be severe.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Northern Ireland prison officer recruitment drive launched,"By Vincent KearneyBBC NI home affairs correspondent It is the first recruitment campaign for prison officers in Northern Ireland for more than 20 years. The new custody officers will replace prison officers leaving as part of a redundancy scheme. So far 371 officers have volunteered to leave and that number is expected to rise by the time applications for redundancy close on Friday. There are more than 1,700 prison officers in Northern Ireland and the prison service wants 540 of them to retire early to make way for new recruits on lower salaries. The redundancy scheme has been introduced for officers aged over 50. Many qualify for a lump sum payment of more than £100,000, plus an annual pension of £18,500. Up to 200 new jobs are now available for custody officers, who will be responsible for maintaining security and supervising the movement of prisoners. Prison officers who take redundancy can apply to be re-employed in the new roles. But sources say that is unlikely to happen, because the new jobs will not be as financially attractive. Transformation The new custody officers will start on a salary of £18,000 - rising to a maximum of £23,000. The prison officers targeted in the redundancy scheme earn up to £38,000 a year. Director-General of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, Colin McConnell, said that the new posts were not a result of cost-cutting measures. ""This really is about the wholesale transformation of the Northern Ireland Prison Service,"" he said. ""The economics of the organisation are a key element of that, and the salaries that staff have been enjoying were driven by the circumstances of the past. ""Making comparisons with other jurisdictions and looking at the Northern Ireland economy now and what the taxpayer can afford, we believe we've put in place competitive rates. ""Salary is only one part of it. This really is about refreshing, and changing and refocusing the Northern Ireland Prison Service moving forward."" Applicants will have to pass a number of tests to be short-listed for further assessment, and those appointed will undergo regular on-the-job training and testing to move up the salary scale. Unlike the Patten reforms of policing, there will not be a 50-50 recruitment process, but the advertisements welcome applications from Catholics, who currently make up 10% of the prison service workforce. They also target women, who account for 22% of staff. The redundancy scheme and recruitment of new staff are key parts of a fundamental programme of reforms for a prison service that has been widely criticised in recent years. The aim is a new approach as well as new faces.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sir Richard Branson abandons English Channel kitesurf attempt,"He had aimed to break two world records to become the oldest person to kitesurf the Channel and make the fastest crossing by a kite-surfing team. The 61-year-old had planned to make the 30-mile journey to Kent in about two and a half hours. He turned back but his friends and family continued. The Virgin boss said he hoped to make the crossing on Sunday. The team left Wimereux in northern France at midday. 'Told to go back' Sir Richard's son, Sam, reached Folkestone in two hours and 18 minutes and became the fastest person to kitesurf solo across the Channel after he beat the previous record set in 1999 by 12 minutes. Sam and eight others who finished also entered the record books as the fastest group of kitesurfers to make the Channel crossing, for which there was no previous record. After sailing to Folkestone beach, Sir Richard said: ""I got half-way across and the kite was foolishly too small for me. ""I was heading for the cliffs of Dover where there is no beach. ""I was told to go back to France, which I did, to get a bigger kite. When I got there they had packed the kites up and were heading to England. ""My plan is to congratulate my son and give it another go tomorrow. I would like to finish the job off. It would have been lovely to have reached the finish line as planned."" His son said: ""I feel pretty euphoric. It's an amazing thing to have done. The main moment when it really hit me was when we were coming in and could see the white cliffs of Dover.""

Amanda Knox: DNA evidence defended by Italian police,"Knox, 24, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, are appealing against their convictions for killing the Surrey student in Perugia in 2007. On Monday, experts told the court the DNA evidence which helped convict the American could have been contaminated. But the scientific police director has defended the original forensic work. In a letter read out to the court, Piero Angeloni described the technology used as being world-class and said the officers were highly experienced. ""Never before"" has there been such criticism of his agency, he said. Patrizia Stefanoni, the police forensic scientist who originally found the DNA on the knife and Miss Kercher's torn bra clasp, has said she will fight the appeal trial experts' accusation that basic errors were made. 'Not reliable' During proceedings in Perugia, prosecutor Manuela Comodi sought to undermine the independent experts' conclusions and show that the forensic evidence used to convict Knox could stand. The experts - appointed by the court to review the evidence and procedures used to obtain it - maintain that the original investigation was marked by some glaring errors, the Associated Press reports. Much of the debate centred on a kitchen knife the prosecutors believe to be the murder weapon. In the first trial, prosecutors maintained that Knox's DNA was found on the knife's handle and Miss Kercher's DNA was found on the blade. They also said Sollecito's DNA was found on the clasp of Miss Kercher's bra. But the appeals court heard that the collection of evidence fell below international standards. Carla Vecchiotti, a forensic specialist from La Sapienza university, Rome, said it was impossible to say whether the British student's DNA was found on the knife. ""There is a complete genetic profile, but it's not reliable,"" she said. ""We don't know if Meredith's DNA was on it or not."" Ms Comodi insisted that the genetic profile found on the blade should not be thrown out. Miss Kercher, a Leeds University student, was living in Italy as part of a year of study abroad when she died. Knox is serving a 26-year sentence for Miss Kercher's murder while Sollecito, an Italian, was sentenced to 25 years. Both deny any wrongdoing. Rudy Guede, 21, was also convicted of Miss Kercher's murder in a separate trial and is serving a 16-year term. The hearing was adjourned until September.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What Charles Manson and his followers did in California in 1969,"He directed his followers, known as the ""Manson Family"", to commit nine murders and he spent four decades in jail. It was the horrific killing spree of seven people in August 1969 that gave him the reputation as one of America's most notorious criminal. Charles Manson wasn't there when the murders took place, but was convicted and given the death sentence. That was later changed to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty. Watch Newsbeat's video charting Charles Manson's life. One of the most famous people killed by Manson's followers was actress Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant at the time. Also murdered on 9 August 1969 at her husband Roman Polanski's rented home in Los Angeles were Abigail Folger, a coffee heiress, celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring, Polish movie director Voityck Frykowski and Steven Parent, a friend of the estate's caretaker. The next night, 10 August 1969, a wealthy grocer and his wife, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, were stabbed to death in their home across town in Los Angeles. Manson told his ""family"" to carry out the crimes in the most gruesome way possible. The victims were stabbed, hanged and shot. Charles Manson was influenced by music and dreamed of becoming a pop star. He even had one of his songs recorded by The Beach Boys. He was obsessed with The Beatles - particularly their songs Piggies and Helter Skelter, which he believed predicted a future race war. After a trial that lasted a nearly a year, Manson and four of his followers - Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles ""Tex"" Watson and Leslie Van Houten - were found guilty of murder. Susan Atkins died of cancer behind bars in 2009, while Krenwinkel, Watson and Van Houten are still in prison. Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme tried to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975, but her gun jammed. She served 34 years in prison and is now living under an assumed identity. At the time of Charles Manson's trial, she camped outside the court with other followers. She was convicted of trying to stop his imprisoned ""family"" from testifying and refused to give evidence herself - and served two short prison terms. Music teacher Gary Hinman was also killed in 1969 by Manson followers Bruce Davis and Bobby Beausoleil, while Davis also murdered stuntman and ranch hand Donald ""Shorty"" Shea. Steven ""Clem"" Grogan was released from prison in 1985 after revealing the whereabouts of Shea's body. Where are the ""Manson Family"" members now? Charles Manson spent 46 years in prison. Earlier this month he was admitted to hospital in California and died of natural causes on Sunday.

Turner Prize exhibition opens to public,"The exhibition is being held outside England for the first time. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington, in Londonderry. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. Four artists are in contention for the award. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. Director of Tate Britain, Penelope Curtis, said: ""Derry was an obvious place to bring the Turner Prize with it being the City of Culture year. ""We wanted the Turner Prize to be more diverse and Derry was the right place. ""London gets lots of contemporary art but Derry gets less. ""Bringing it to the barracks seemed quite a controversial decision at the start but Derry feels very different now after my first visit 20 years ago. ""This is the most diverse Turner Prize ever put on and this is a real chance for being part of history."" Journalists from across the world descended on Derry for a preview on Tuesday morning. Chief executive of the Culture Company, Shona McCarthy, said: ""This is absolutely amazing for the city. ""This is a world class gallery space at Ebrington Square. ""It's exciting for our young people to have this in their city."" The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. Derry-born artist Willie Doherty said: ""We have reached the main point of the year in my eyes. ""I'm not convinced that this space at Ebrington should be turned into an office space. ""We need to keep this as an art gallery."" Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Extracts and Verses exhibition at the Chisenhale Gallery. She is of Ghanaian descent and is the first black woman to be in contention for the award. Glasgow-based David Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greetings cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries.

Dell faces fresh security questions as new issue found,"By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News The new problem - similar to the first - could leave users' personal information vulnerable, researchers backed by the US government said. Dell said it had again released a fix, after doing the same for the first problem earlier this week. The repeated issues raised concerns about the company's attitude towards security, one expert told the BBC. In a statement, Dell said that the second problem affected users who downloaded its Dell System Detect product between 20 October and 24 November 2015. It said the second issue was not pre-installed on computers - as the first was. It said the product was removed from its site once the issue was spotted and a replacement application was made available. Earlier this week, Dell said it had inadvertently opened up a security hole in its computers when it pre-installed software on them. A self-signed root certificate authority (CA), which is used to identify trustworthy websites, was ""implemented as part of a support tool and intended to make it faster and easier for our customers to service their system"", Dell said. But the CA it installed, called ""eDellRoot"", allowed hackers to intercept a Dell user's internet traffic, while the private key that came installed with it could be used to trick the computer into thinking that unsafe websites were safe, security researchers pointed out. 'Impersonation' The second vulnerability, another CA called ""DSDTestProvider"", worked in much the same way, according to the Germany-based journalist who reported it to US Department of Homeland Security-backed researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: Hanno Böck. In their subsequent report, the researchers wrote: ""An attacker can generate certificates signed by the DSDTestProvider CA. Systems that trusts the DSDTestProvider CA will trust any certificate issued by the CA. ""An attacker can impersonate web sites and other services, sign software and email messages, and decrypt network traffic and other data.

Dreamland operator Sands Heritage has debts 'over £14m',"Operator Sands Heritage called in administrators Duff and Phelps in May - 11 months after the attraction reopened following an £18m revamp. A report lists various setbacks involving owners Thanet District Council. It declined to discuss the details before creditors met on Thursday. Figures showed Dreamland had total liabilities of £14.3m. The report said the attraction would continue to trade during the 2016 summer season. The report, a statement of administrator's proposals to be put before creditors on Thursday, said: ""A sale of the business and assets of the company is likely to be the eventual outcome of the administration, however, an immediate sale is not being pursued."" It set out events leading to Dreamland going into administration. When the operator took over the park from Thanet council in 2015, the company also took over delayed building works - leading to significant costs to the company and summer closures of Dreamland and the Scenic Railway, the report said. Further delays by Thanet council in handing over areas adjacent to the park also brought cash flow problems in April 2016, it added. That Easter, delayed certifications, bad weather and train engineering works reduced footfall, the report said. And it said the company's cash position continued to deteriorate and administrators were called in that May. Thanet council said the creditors' meeting was part of the administration process and, as a creditor, the council would be part of this. A council spokeswoman said: ""The council has been provided with assurances that the administrators are assessing all available options for the company and Dreamland Pleasure Park and that they are certain there is a bright future for Dreamland."" Benjamin Wiles, joint administrator, said: ""The events leading up to and the circumstances surrounding the administration of Dreamland are not down to any one factor or stakeholder."" He said the administrators were working closely in collaboration with Thanet council and other stakeholders to improve and secure the future of Dreamland. In a separate development, Dreamland's main attraction, the Scenic Railway, is currently closed for repairs. A spokeswoman said the rollercoaster needed a new lift rope, which had to be done by a specialist, and engineers were working to get the ride ""up and running asap"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Stansted 15' protesters' counter-terrorism convictions appealed,"The ""Stansted 15"" were convicted under counter-terrorism legislation on 10 December 2018. The protesters cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet. The Court of Appeal was told laws used to convict them were intended to deal with terrorism, not demonstrators. The protesters all pleaded not guilty, but were convicted of the intentional disruption of services at an aerodrome in March 2017 under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990. The jet they targeted had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Africa. In February 2019 three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. At the beginning of the appeal hearing in London, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The High Court heard the demonstrators' lawyers were prevented from arguing their actions were necessary to the jury by the judge at the trial, because they were not trying to prevent an immediate domestic crime. However, they said stopping the plane was necessary to prevent the deportation of people at risk of harm in their destination countries, including LGBT people believed to be on board. Lead counsel for the protesters, Clare Montgomery QC, told the court each defendant believed there was ""an immediate threat"" and their actions were ""effectively the last opportunity that was available to anyone in this country"". Documents presented to the court by the group's barristers stated that the Amsa legislation was there to deal with ""unlawful violence of the utmost seriousness"" such as terrorism, not demonstrators. Lawyers for the group also argued that the Attorney General - who is required to sign off on the use of this legislation - should not have granted consent for the law to be used in this case, that the Crown Court judge, Judge Christopher Morgan, made errors in summing up the case, and there were errors in directions given to the jury. In their written argument, barristers representing the Crown said the convictions were safe and the trial judge was correct. They said the fact the protesters had planned their action weeks in advance was not consistent with a defence of necessity, and that there are strict limits on when that can be used. The appeal hearing is expected to last three days. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Carrie Fisher gave a cow tongue to predatory producer,"Heather Ross, who works in the film industry, told Fisher about how the unnamed producer sexually assaulted her in his car. Fisher reacted by personally delivering the cow tongue in a Tiffany box wrapped in a bow to his office in Los Angeles. Ross revealed the story on US radio station, 94.9 MixFM in light of the recent Harvey Weinstein allegations. Ross spoke about how she contacted the producer - who is not Weinstein - to try and be a part of his new project. After meeting up, she says the producer forced himself on her in his car after making an excuse to pull over, then reached over and climbed on top of her. Ross told the radio show she managed to push the producer off her, but as she fled, he said: ""You'll never make a movie in my town and get the F out of my car."" Carrie's no-nonsense message When she told Fisher about what had happened, the late Star Wars actress took matters into her own hands. ""About two weeks later, she sent me a message online and said, 'I just saw [blank] at Sony Studios. I knew he would probably be there, so I went to his office and personally delivered a Tiffany box wrapped with a white bow.'"" Ross continued: ""I asked her what was inside and she said, 'It was a cow tongue from Jerry's Famous Deli in Westwood with a note that said, if you ever touch my darling Heather or any other woman again, the next delivery will be something of yours in a much smaller box!'"" Ross added that knowing the Star Wars actress had her back had left a lasting impression on her. ""It felt validating to know, OK, first of all, this woman who I love as a friend was not just a fake Hollywood friend. That's who Carrie Fisher was. She spoke out and she put things out there in your face,"" she said. Fisher, best known for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars films, died at the age of 60 in December.

Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines president says he killed someone as teenager,"""At 16, I killed someone,"" he told Filipinos in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang, where he is attending a regional summit. He said he stabbed the person ""just over a look"". His spokesman later said his remarks had been ""in jest"". Mr Duterte has previously said he killed criminal suspects as mayor of the city of Davao. The Filipino leader is attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, alongside regional leaders and US President Donald Trump. He has presided over a massive crackdown on crime in the Philippines, which critics allege undermines fundamental human rights. Mr Duterte has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drugs trade, and said he would ""be happy to slaughter"" three million drug addicts in the country. Addressing the Filipino community in Da Nang, he said he had killed a person during his violent teenage years, when he said he was in numerous fights and ""in and out of jail"". But a spokesman for the president, Harry Roque, told the AFP news agency that the remarks were ""in jest"" and the Filipino leader often used ""colourful language"" when addressing Filipinos overseas. Mr Duterte has previously said he possibly killed someone while a teenager. In 2015 he told the Philippines edition of Esquire magazine that during ""a tumultuous fight in the beach"" when he was 17, ""maybe I stabbed somebody to death"". It is not clear if he was referring to the same incident in his speech. He also claims to have thrown corrupt officials out of helicopters, warning officials he would do it again if they embezzled financial aid. His spokesman described that claim as an ""urban legend"". Speaking about human rights during his Vietnam visit, Mr Duterte proposed a ""world summit"" on the issue - but not looking solely at human rights abuses in the Philippines. ""What makes the death of people in the Philippines more important than the rest of the children in the world that were massacred and killed?"" the Manila Bulletin quoted him as saying. Since he took office, police say they have killed almost 4,000 people in anti-drug operations. More than 2,000 others have been killed in connection with drug-related crimes. In September, the proposed budget for the human rights commission investigating the deaths was cut to 1,000 pesos - the equivalent of $20 (£15). It had asked for 1.72bn pesos ($34m). Mr Duterte is due to hold bilateral talks with US President Donald Trump in the Philippines in the coming days - the first meeting between the pair. The Philippines president was adversarial towards Mr Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, labelling him a ""son of a whore."" Mr Obama cancelled their scheduled meeting.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ellie Yarrow-Sanders: Judge's Twitter plea to missing mum,"Ellie Yarrow-Sanders, 26, disappeared with Olly Sheridan in July after becoming involved in family court litigation with her ex-partner Patrick Sheridan. It is thought to be the first time a judge has used Twitter in this way. Miss Yarrow-Sanders' family have since issued a statement saying she should only return ""under certain conditions"". Mr Justice Williams's plea was delivered in a tweet posted on the Judicial Office Twitter account using the hashtag #comehomeolly. In a post on Facebook, Miss Yarrow-Sanders' mother Donna, 47, and sister Maddie, 22, insisted the family were not ""not siding"" with Mr Sheridan, who is in his mid-40s, after a joint plea for the young mother to return home was issued on Friday. Maddie Yarrow said the family appeal was being made by ""us independently, and with the judge"" and said that for her sister, the decision to ""go on the run with her son"" was the ""hardest decision of her life"". She wrote: ""As her mother and sister, we support her coming home but only on certain conditions, such as safety from being prosecuted and that she will not lose custody. ""Please believe that we are doing this with the best interest of them both, as a life on the run is very lonely."" Miss Yarrow also said that she missed her sister and nephew ""more every day"". Mr Justice Williams' tweet used the hashtag #comehomeolly and analysed the latest stage of the litigation at a hearing on Friday. He oversaw a hearing in private, but authorised lawyers to release a statement detailing his message to Miss Yarrow-Sanders. It reassured her that she would not be ""punished"" for coming back and promised that she would be ""given a voice in court"" in order for the case to be dealt with fairly. The statement also said a senior social worker had been appointed to ""promote Olly's welfare"". Lawyers said the judge had made it clear that such a move did not mean there was any chance of the toddler being placed in foster care.

Western Sahara welcomes Morocco's African Union membership,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. What difference will this make to Western Sahara? It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. Algeria fell out with Morocco over Western Sahara - has that changed? No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. Why did the AU not insist on Morocco recognising Western Sahara? There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. Why did Morocco want to rejoin - is it a shift from being Arab-focused to looking towards Africa? No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent. Moroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975. How did we get here?

Marathon Oil firm fined £1.16m for North Sea gas release,"The incident happened on Marathon Oil's Brae Alpha platform, 155 miles north east of Aberdeen, on Boxing Day 2015. The company admitted Offshore Installations (Prevention of Fire and Explosion, and Emergency Response) and Health and Safety at Work Act breaches. Marathon was fined £1.16m at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. No-one was injured in the incident. Most of the 100 personnel on the platform had been gathered in the accommodation block, ahead of their Boxing Day meal, so they were not near the leak. Pipework ruptured, allowing more than two tonnes of high-pressure methane gas to be released, causing what was described as significant damage. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said Marathon Oil had failed to undertake any suitable and sufficient inspection of the pipework that would have allowed the company to identify the risk and prevent the hazard. 'Timing fortuitous' HSE inspector Ahmedur Rezwan, said: ""This incident is a further reminder of the ever-present hazards in oil and gas production, that if not rigorously managed can easily result in a potentially life-threatening event. ""During any normal period of operations personnel could easily have been working in, or transiting through Module 14, and they would almost certainly have been killed or suffered serious injury. ""The timing of the incident and fact that the gas did not ignite was fortuitous."" Marathon said in a statement: ""Marathon Oil confirms that the company has been fined in a case relating to a gas release which occurred on the Brae Alpha platform on 26 December 2015. ""The company has fully co-operated with the HSE and complied with the measures suggested in the improvement notice. ""The safety of our personnel is a top priority, and we've taken action to resolve issues relating to this incident."" Alistair Duncan, head of the health and safety investigation unit at the Crown Office, said: ""This incident could have been prevented had suitable and sufficient measures been put in place. ""Hopefully this prosecution and the sentence will remind other employers that failure to fulfil their obligations can have potentially very serious consequences and that they will be held to account for their failings."" In 2015, Total was fined £1.125m over a gas leak from 2012.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greening: UK will not accept migrant relocation quotas,"Justine Greening said the government will not accept mandatory quotas. The European Commission is expected to announce details of its plan to deal with the migrants on Wednesday. Reports suggest it will call for a quota system for member states to relocate some 40,000 asylum seekers. The UK has an opt-out which it has previously said it would use. Many of the migrants arrived in southern Europe by boat in recent months. 'Work together' The plan to use quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy among several EU countries, including France and Spain. Ms Greening told the BBC: ""We don't accept having mandatory quotas or mandatory resettlement programmes. ""Our concern is that approach simply ends up acting as a pull for more migrants to make, what for many of them is a life and death decision to get on a boat that may not be sea worthy and over the past year 5,000 migrants have died at sea."" She said looking at why people were making the journeys was key. ""If you look at what is driving people to start these journeys in the first place, it's the hope of a better life,"" she said. ""And that's why the only real answer in the long term is to work together, as the international community, to tackle what is an international problem and to work together to deliver development and to level up the world so that we don't leave anyone behind, or leave anyone living in poverty in the future, as is happened in the past."" The issue was catapulted to the top of the EU agenda after hundreds of people were believed to have drowned when a boat carrying up to 700 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea in April. The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year. More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014. The UK has deployed a warship - HMS Bulwark - and search and rescue helicopters to the waters between Libya and Italy.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Bank Holiday change will 'cost calendar maker £200,000'","By Esyllt CarrBusiness reporter, BBC News Last week, the government announced the bank holiday, set for Monday 4 May, would be switched to Friday 8 May, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Allan & Bertram said as a result about 400,000 of its calendars which had already been printed would have to have the May 2020 pages replaced. The government said it had considered the practical implications of its move. But the manager of one calendar maker said it had ""probably been the single most stressful week that I have ever faced in business"". ""We're totally in agreement with changing the date. Just not changing it with 11 months notice, when you've had 74 years to prepare for this event,"" said Andrew Bennett, managing director of Hertfordshire-based Allan & Bertram. It is only the second time the early May bank holiday has been moved - the first was in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day. On that occasion people were given more notice, said Mr Bennett. ""They announced that in December 1993. That was absolutely fine. ""There was no reason why this decision couldn't have been made 18 months ago."" As well as employing extra temporary staff, the team would be working double shifts to make the necessary changes, Mr Bennett said. While the calendars were originally assembled by a machine, the process of swapping the individual pages for updated ones will have to be done manually. Despite the cost, he said sending them out with the wrong date would have been too damaging for the company's brand. ""Our clients expect the product to be right. The easy thing to do would have been to do nothing, or put a sticker on it, but if you want to focus on quality, you have to correct the problem."" The British Printing Industry Federation, which represents about 1,300 printing businesses, said while it welcomed the commemoration of VE day, it too believed the government should have consulted with groups that would be affected by the change. ""A number of members will lose money due to calendars and diaries for 2020 being printed already,"" said managing director Dale Wallis. ""It is my understanding that there is no opportunity for compensation. This could cause serious cash flow issues, and therefore other issues for those businesses affected."" A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had ""considered the practical implications of moving this bank holiday"". Allan & Bertram's Andrew Bennett said the government should acknowledge the impact of the timing of the decision on businesses like his - and offer compensation for costs they will incur. ""As a business, we will survive. But it's not just the money - it's the pressure on production that will now make this year incredibly hard.""

Danube boat accident: More bodies found as vessel is raised in Hungary,"A floating crane raised The Mermaid to the surface, allowing divers to enter. The boat was carrying South Korean tourists when it was hit by a cruise ship and capsized, killing 20 people and leaving eight missing. Recovery efforts by Hungarian and South Korean teams have been hampered by high water levels in the Danube. Footage from the scene on Tuesday morning showed the cabin and upper deck of the boat emerge from the water and divers carry out a search for victims still trapped inside. The four bodies recovered have not been formally identified, but they are believed to be those of the boat's Hungarian captain and three South Koreans including a six-year-old girl - the only child to die in the accident. The rest of the 70-year-old boat was then slowly brought to the surface with pumps removing water from the hull to stabilise it, and lifted on to a barge. One of the divers, Zoltan Papp, said attaching straps to the hull of the boat had been difficult because visibility in the muddy, fast-flowing river had been as low as 10cm (4in) at times. ""It was like being in heavy snowfall or fog,"" he told Reuters news agency. At one point in Tuesday's operation, a member of the recovery crew fell into the swollen river and had to be rescued by colleagues. Another four people are believed to still be missing. After the ship was raised, a police spokesman said search efforts would be doubled to find them. How did the accident happen? The Viking Sigyn cruise ship struck the Mermaid just after 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on 29 May as both vessels passed under the Margaret Bridge. Seven of the 35 people on board were rescued and several bodies quickly recovered, but others were swept away in the swollen river or trapped inside the boat. Police said the boat had sunk within seven seconds of the collision. ""The current was so fast and people were floating away,"" one survivor, identified only by her surname Jung, told South Korea's Yonhap news agency. More bodies were recovered in the following days, with one pulled from the Danube more than 100km (60 miles) downstream. Excluding the unidentified four recovered on Tuesday, 19 South Korean tourists and a Hungarian crewman are so far confirmed to have died. The disaster was the worst on the Danube - Europe's second-longest river - in more than 50 years. What about the investigation? The wreck of the Mermaid will be taken to a secure location and examined by police, who have launched a criminal investigation. The Viking Sigyn's captain, named as 64-year-old Ukrainian national Yuriy C, was detained on suspicion of reckless misconduct in waterborne traffic leading to mass casualties. His lawyers said he was devastated but did nothing wrong. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his government would co-operate with Hungarian authorities ""to thoroughly investigate the incident"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny attacked with ""brilliant green"" dye","It is the second time he has been attacked with zelyonka (""brilliant green"" in English) this year. The dye is a common antiseptic in Russia and has been used in protests there and in Ukraine. ""It looks funny but it hurts like hell,"" Mr Navalny tweeted. It is not clear who carried out the attack, which happened near the offices of the Anti-Corruption Fund (FBK) that he founded. According to one report (in Russian) he was diagnosed with a chemical burn to the eye. Mr Navalny is one of the foremost Russian critics of President Vladimir Putin and has announced his intention to run for president himself. But his intentions may be thwarted - he has been convicted of embezzlement, which would bar him from running for office, although he denies it. A new weapon of choice - Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring A mild antiseptic known as ""brilliant green"" has recently become a weapon of choice against government critics in Russia. Mr Navalny has been doused with it twice this year. One of Russia's most popular bloggers, Ilya Varlamov, had it thrown at him twice on the same day on 26 April. And pro-Western politician Mikhail Kasyanov had it splashed in his face at a rally commemorating murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov. So why brilliant green? It stains the skin and is hard to wash off, which can be a problem if you want to take the media spotlight. Also, it doesn't do any lasting damage, which means attackers will not be facing charges of grave bodily harm. But the attackers don't always have the last laugh. When Mr Navalny was last doused he turned his green face into an internet meme and was imitated by his supporters. Mr Navalny was among 500 people arrested after organising an anti-corruption rally last month. Rallies across the country were the biggest opposition demonstrations in Russia in several years. He has said repeatedly that he wants to challenge Vladimir Putin's control of the Kremlin and expose what he claims is the ""myth"" that Mr Putin commands more than 80% popular support. Meanwhile a separate opposition group, Open Russia, says its office has been raided by police, a day after the group was blacklisted by the authorities. Activists said more than 20 riot police raided the office and removed computer equipment and 100,000 flyers for an unsanctioned rally planned for this weekend. Open Russia was founded by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who lives in exile after spending 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fastest-growing UK terror threat 'from far-right',"Neil Basu, the UK head of counter-terrorism, said seven of the 22 plots foiled since March 2017 have been linked to the ideology. He said far-right terrorism had gone from 6% of the caseload two years ago to 10% today, adding: ""It's small but it's my fastest-growing problem."" But, he said, the biggest threat still came from jihadists. Mr Basu, Assistant Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, said some of the right-wing plots they disrupted were ""designed to kill people"" - and methods mimicked those seen in jihadist attacks, with some even using Islamic State materials. Speaking at a briefing on Thursday, Mr Basu said about 10% of around 800 live terror investigations were linked to right-wing extremism. Children as young as 14 have been involved in extremist activity, the briefing was told. He also said the government's terrorism-prevention programme, Prevent, which aims to stop people being radicalised, has seen referrals nearly doubling since 2015/16 to 18%. ""Despite the increases, right-wing terrorism remains a relatively small percentage of our overall demand, but when nearly a third of the plots foiled by police and security services since 2017 relate to right-wing ideology, it lays bare why we are taking this so seriously,"" he said. ""As a proportion of our overall threat it's definitely increasing, whereas the Islamist threat is staying the same, albeit at a very high level."" Mr Basu added young people and those with mental health issues were particularly vulnerable to becoming radicalised. Last week white supremacist Vincent Fuller, 50, was jailed for 18 years and nine months for stabbing 19-year-old Bulgarian Dimitar Mihaylov in what a judge called a ""terrorist act"". Three other right-wing activists are due to be sentenced in London and Leeds on Friday. But Mr Basu said police ""can't arrest ourselves out of this problem"" and called on the public to come forward if they fear a friend or family member is becoming radicalised. ""I have been called ridiculously idealistic, but I believe more than ever that evil triumphs when good people do nothing,"" he said. Asked whether the police's approach to right-wing threats has changed in recent years, he said: ""I would say that some of the criticism that we did not look at white supremacist, right-wing violence as terrorism in the past is probably justified."" He said investigations into the banned group National Action ""have broken that organisation"". National Action was proscribed in 2016, becoming the first neo-Nazi group to be outlawed under terrorism legislation. The briefing was also told the threat comes from a ""spectrum"" of right-wing ideologies. They range from far-right groups that are anti-immigration and anti-Islam and so-called white nationalists through to neo-Nazi white supremacists, such as National Action and its spin-offs, System Resistance Network and Sonnenkrieg Division. Since last year the Security Service MI5 has been working closely with counter-terrorism police to tackle the threat.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Plans to change NI prostitution and trafficking laws,"If passed into legislation, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill, proposed by the DUP's Lord Morrow, would make Northern Ireland the lead in the UK on human trafficking law. The bill aims to enhance services for victims as well as making it an offence to pay for sexual services from a prostitute. The consultation period ends on 18 October. Buying or selling sex is legal across the UK, however, many activities related to prostitution, including kerb crawling, running a brothel and pimping, are all outlawed. Lord Morrow said it was illegal to pay for sex in Northern Ireland from someone who has been coerced. ""The majority of rescued victims of trafficking in Northern Ireland are those brought here for sexual exploitation and I believe that we can do better,"" he said. ""For instance, in Sweden, there's a very clear message of zero tolerance for the purchase of sex that has had a clear impact on trafficking."" Other points in the Stormont bill include extending the definition of 'other exploitation' to include forced begging; defining a victim of trafficking and outlining compensation procedures for victims. It proposes allowing courts to take aggravating factors into consideration when passing sentence. Criminal law The bill also aims to ensure child victims have a legal advocate to support them through the relevant criminal, immigration and compensation procedures, and provide special measures for trafficking victims if they act as witnesses. It will also set out what assistance and civil legal services are available to victims of trafficking, and ensure no prosecution is brought for a criminal offence committed by a trafficking victim as a direct consequence of being trafficked. Lord Morrow's bill also proposes training for police and prosecutors. It urges the Department of Justice to produce an annual strategy on raising awareness of and reducing trafficking. Public consultation is currently taking place in the Republic of Ireland about the future of legislation on prostitution. It is due to be referred to an Oireachtas committee at the end of this month. Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter said that while there was a clear consensus on the ""evils"" of child prostitution and sex trafficking, there are ""differing and genuinely held views"" on how criminal law should deal with prostitution.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dorchester prison closure plan a 'blow' say unions,"The Victorian prison near Dorchester town centre is among four English sites to close under government plans. The Prison Officers Association (POA) expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the decision. The government insists the changes would ""modernise"" the prison system and reduce costs. A new £250m super-prison in north Wales that will house 2,000 inmates has been announced The government says everything possible will be done to avoid compulsory redundancies by redeploying staff. 'Remarkable results' Speaking before a meeting with staff at Dorchester, John Hancock of the POA said: ""Everyone knows it is an old building but the relationship between the inmates and the staff has always been good and there have been some remarkable results. ""It's a huge blow to the economy of Dorchester."" He said the ""only saving grace"" is that 60 staff will be able to transfer to HMP The Verne in nearby Portland. HMP The Verne is to be converted into an immigration removal centre, providing around 600 additional places to hold immigration detainees awaiting removal from the country. West Dorset MP and Minister for Government Policy, Oliver Letwin admitted it was a ""worrying"" time for the 157 staff at Dorchester Prison. ""However, I have talked to the Justice Secretary about this, and I am glad that he expects to be able to find jobs elsewhere in the prison service for all of the staff involved."" 'Negative impact' Earlier this year Dorchester was earmarked as a so-called resettlement jail to house prisoners close to where they live. Dorset's police and crime commissioner Martyn Underhill said he was ""disappointed and dismayed"" at the closure. ""I am concerned that this decision will have a negative impact on the county's ability to proactively work with partners to rehabilitate offenders,"" he said. Jane Barkes of the Footsteps Project charity, which has worked in the prison mentoring inmates for the past eight years, said she was ""very sad"" about the closure.

"Trump sends family $25,000 after claim of broken promise","The father of a soldier killed in Afghanistan said Mr Trump offered $25,000 (£19,000) of his own money during a June phone call. The White House said it was ""disgusting"" that the media would exploit the issue. The dispute came as Mr Trump denied being insensitive to a war widow. On Wednesday, the president rejected a claim that he had told the wife of a soldier killed in Niger this month her husband knew what he signed up for. Later that day, the Washington Post reported on a phone call that bereaved father Chris Baldridge said he had received from the president. His 22-year-old son Cpl Dillon Baldridge was killed over the summer by a rogue Afghan commander he had been training. Mr Baldridge said that during the call he vented frustration to Mr Trump about a US military survivor benefits programme. To his surprise, he said, the president offered to send a personal cheque and set up an online fundraiser. But the family told the Post they are still waiting for the money. ""I was just floored,"" said Mr Baldridge, of Zebulon, North Carolina. ""I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. ""He said, 'No other president has ever done something like this,' but he said, 'I'm going to do it.'"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told US media hours later: ""The cheque has been sent. ""It's disgusting that the media is taking something that should be recognised as a generous and sincere gesture, made privately by the President, and using it to advance the media's biased agenda."" Jessie Baldridge, stepmother of the slain soldier, told local media the family feels no resentment towards Mr Trump over the delay. ""We just thought he was saying something nice,"" she told WTVD, a local TV station, in North Carolina. ""We got a condolence letter from him and there was no cheque, and we kind of joked about it."" A White House official said the payment ""has been in the pipeline since the President's initial call with the father"". ""There is a substantial process that can involve multiple agencies anytime the President interacts with the public, especially when transmitting personal funds"", the official said. ""The President has personally followed up several times to ensure that the cheque was being sent. As stated earlier, the cheque has been sent."" Mr Trump is not the first president to be accused of breaking his word to a grieving family. In 2016, President Barack Obama was prodded into sending a donation by cheque to a foundation set up by the family of slain US hostage Kayla Mueller. The White House acted after an ABC News report that the private presidential promise was unkept.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Basic rights of mentally ill 'violated',"By Adam BrimelowHealth Correspondent, BBC News The Health Select Committee said there was evidence some people are being sectioned unnecessarily to secure hospital treatment. It also warned safeguards to protect patients who lack capacity are often ignored. The charity Rethink said the findings were ""shocking"". Changes to mental health laws in 2007 were supposed to ease pressure on psychiatric units by extending the treatment available out of hospital. Legislation provided for Community Treatment Orders so some people previously detained in hospital could be treated - under supervision - in the community. But compulsory detention has continued to increase. The report said in 2008-09 there were 42,208 detentions in England. By 2011-12 the figure had risen to 44,894. 'Ticket to a bed' Many wards are at over-capacity. The MPs were told it has become hard to be admitted voluntarily. One witness said ""being detained is the ticket to getting a bed"". Their report said compulsory detention when it was not clinically necessary would be a ""serious violation"" of civil rights. It called for an urgent investigation by the Department of Health to establish the prevalence of the practice. The inquiry also examined safeguards to protect people detained under the Mental Capacity Act. These are often patients in care homes with dementia or severe learning difficulties. The safeguards include provisions to provide a representative, to offer a right of challenge, and for a regular review of their deprivation of liberty. The MPs concluded there was ""extreme variation in their use"" - a situation they describe as ""profoundly depressing"". They called for an urgent review of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DOLS) together with an action plan for improvement to be presented to Parliament within 12 months. Paul Jenkins, from the charity Rethink, said: ""It's absolutely shocking that people are being sectioned unnecessarily, just so they can get access to the treatment they are entitled to. Being sectioned, although sometimes necessary, can be extremely distressing and should only be used as a last resort. ""Treatment is much less likely to work if it is imposed on patients against their wishes. Health professionals should be aiming to build a trusting partnership with their patients and to take away their liberty unnecessarily like this, completely undermines that trust."" Dr Julie Chalmers, the Royal College of Psychiatrists' lead for mental health law, said: ""We share the committee's concerns over the severe pressure on beds, and believe this is an issue that needs to be urgently addressed. ""However it is also important to ensure that there are a range of effective community services to support people who are in crisis before the need to consider hospital admission arises.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Airlines told to pay flight compensation,"American, Etihad, Emirates, Singapore and Turkish Airlines will have to obey European laws or be taken to court. All had told the Civil Aviation Authority that they did not pay compensation when their delays meant passengers missed a connecting flight. But compensation is in fact due if passengers arrive at their final destination more than three hours late. Richard Moriarty, Director of Consumers and Markets at the CAA, said he was disappointed at the airlines' stance. ""Airlines' first responsibility should be looking after their passengers, not finding ways in which they can prevent passengers upholding their rights. ""So it's disappointing to see a small number of airlines continuing to let a number of their passengers down by refusing to pay them the compensation they are entitled to. ""Where we see evidence of passengers systematically being denied their rights, we will not hesitate to take the necessary action to ensure airlines change their policies and their customers get the assistance they are entitled to,"" he added. Which? said that the government should ensure the continuance of passenger rights after the UK leaves the EU. It said there should also be an ombudsman service that all airlines should be required to join. Disgruntled passengers In 2015 the CAA took similar action against Aer Lingus, Jet2 and Wizz Air. For more than a decade airlines have objected ferociously to the European Union rules of 2004 which lay down when compensation must be paid for certain types of delay. The law was subsequently clarified in favour of passengers by decisions of the European Parliament, European Courts of Justice, and the UK Appeal Court in 2014. But every year thousands of disgruntled passengers still have to sue, or threaten to sue, their airlines who try to stall before making compensation payments. For instance, Emirates is involved in a case that is going to the Appeal Court after refusing to pay flight delay compensation to some passengers. And the policy of Singapore airlines is to put compensation claims ""on hold"" if they involve connecting flights, the CAA said. The current rules on cash compensation for delays - which must be the fault of the airline - cover flights departing from an EU airport and operated by any airline; or flights arriving at an EU airport and operated by an EU airline: The CAA said that Emirates was the airline about which it received most complaints for non-payment of compensation. Meanwhile the Spanish low-cost airline Vueling is also being told by the UK regulator to comply with the industry's minimum requirements, to give passengers help if their flights are disrupted. If any of the airlines refuse to obey the regulator and are taken to court they could, in law, be fined an unlimited amount.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Road salt stocks at 'record levels' ahead of winter,"There are currently 243,000 tonnes of salt in stock - compared with 137,000 tonnes at the same time in 2010. Guidance and advice has also been issued to local authorities on the efficient use of salt. Last winter was said to be ""relatively mild"", but it followed two severe winters where bad weather disrupted schools, work and services. Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, and other places on higher ground, have already had their first snow fall this winter, and even last year's relatively mild winter resulted in blizzard conditions in parts of Wales as late as April. Carl Sargeant, Local Government and Communities Minister, said: ""Everybody appreciates that the winter weather in Wales can be unpredictable. The Welsh government and the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) have continued to work closely to ensure that there is sufficient salt stocks at the start of the winter, he added. ""This will ensure that we're fully self sufficient throughout the winter period without the need to re-stock or introduce salt conservation measures."" The aim is to reach a stock of 270,000 tonnes, a third higher than the 200,000 tonnes of salt that was used per year during the adverse winters of 2010/11 and 2009/10. Additional storage facilities have already been set up at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Queensferry in Flintshire and Merthyr Tydfil. Another site in north Wales is due to open, along with one at Llanidloes, Powys. Anthony Christopher, WLGA's spokesman for highways, infrastructure and transport, said local authorities had worked together to prepare for winter. ""They have agreed on each authority maintaining stock levels that should meet their own needs through the winter. Alongside the Welsh government's strategic stock holdings and ""mutual aid"" agreements between authorities it gave ""greater resilience"" to winter weather at a national level, he said. ""We believe that we enter the winter period well-prepared, although any prolonged periods of snow inevitably results in stock holdings running down quickly. ""Ongoing discussions with the main suppliers to Welsh authorities have been aimed at ensuring restocking takes place in an orderly way over the winter period,"" he added. Information on winter salt provision, and general advice on winter weather, can be found at the Welsh government's weather advice website.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Syrian refugees: Celebration party held in Belfast,"By Tara MillsBBC News NI The media was not allowed to report where they were staying initially. Fears over their safety were taken seriously because of the increase in racist attacks the previous year. On Saturday night some of that was relaxed when a party was held in south Belfast to celebrate their arrival and welcome them to Northern Ireland. Louia is 18 and spent two years in Beirut after fleeing his home in Syria with his mum, sister and younger brother. He told me their father died in August from injuries inflicted when he was tortured in prison. Speaking in English, he said: ""I want to thank the people of Belfast and the government for looking after us. ""I want to thank you a million times."" Then, through a translator, he told me the welcoming party was very important: ""When I met all the other Syrians I feel like I'm at home. We discussed all the issues going on in Syria and we felt as if we were at home. We enjoyed all of it."" 'We want them to integrate' Dr Raied Al-Wazzan, an Iraqi who has lived in Northern Ireland for 26 years, helped to organise the event. ""We want them to integrate, we want them to meet local people from the Arab community and local Irish and British people and we also invited potential employers and social clubs to meet them because we want to integrate them as quickly as possible into the community,"" he said. MLAs Máirtín Ó Muilleoir and Emma Pengelly were also there along with the principals of two schools who had several newcomer families join their student population. Mr Ó Muilleoir said: ""The people of Belfast showed an overwhelming amount of generosity when they arrived before Christmas but for all sorts of reasons there wasn't the opportunity to express that. ""We need to make sure that when people come here from other lands having survived the civil war in Syria, coming through the hardships of the refugee camps that when they come here we make them as welcome as the Irish have been made all over the world.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Smart motorway death 'treated as PR exercise by transport minister',"A coroner criticised the roads after hearing Jason Mercer died in a crash on part of the M1 with no hard shoulder. Mr Mercer's widow Claire said Grant Shapps had tried to ""manage"" her when they spoke. A spokesman said Mr Shapps had called an urgent meeting with Highways England in light of the inquest's findings. Mrs Mercer has been campaigning for smart motorways to be scrapped since the fatal crash on 7 June 2019. Her 44-year-old husband and another driver, Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, were stopped on the M1 when a a lorry smashed into their vehicles. She said her local MP Sarah Champion had been ""very supportive"", putting her in touch with various government departments and passing her phone number to Mr Shapps at his request. 'Grieving widow' Mrs Mercer said Mr Shapps had called but she felt he was trying to ""manage"" her and ""PR his way out of this."" Speaking to Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5Live, she said one phone call, before the government announced a review into smart motorways, ""was definitely a PR exercise"". She believed Mr Shapps had ""wanted me to basically agree everything and say that I was on board, and then they could parade me as the grieving widow that agreed with them"". ""I very definitely didn't and I told him that,"" she said. ""The review was just a paperwork exercise and a PR exercise."" The DfT said Mr Shapps had ""recognised the concerns around smart motorway safety"" as soon as he took up office and had ""commissioned an urgent stocktake of the evidence"". ""As part of this, he spoke to several families of those who had died, as well as groups such as the AA and RAC, to ensure the work being done took account of their concerns,"" a spokesman said. At an inquest on Monday, coroner David Urpeth found that Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu were unlawfully killed - a conclusion that surprised Mrs Mercer. ""When the coroner said... that the smart motorways contributed to the death, I cried, several of my family members gasped and I was crying and I got in a bit of a state,"" she said. Mr Urpeth also warned there was ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"" from smart motorways without a hard shoulder. He said he would write to Highways England and Mr Shapps to request a review of the roads. Highways England said it was addressing many of the points raised.

Sport Wales: Fewer pupils in deprived areas doing sport,"By Kate MorganBBC Wales sports news correspondent The School Sport Survey showed the gap between children from the most and least deprived areas taking part in sport widened in the past three years. But it found more children with a disability or from certain ethnic minority groups do sport regularly. Sport Wales is to work on improvements over the next 18 months. About 120,000 children, aged seven to 16, and teachers from schools across Wales took part in the research looking at sports participation, health and well-being. It found: 'A great way to make friends' Dhiya, 13, from Cardiff, said: ""It's about making a new friends and being with everyone and having fun. I play basketball inside school - and out. ""When I first came to this rugby club I attend, there weren't many people there, and my teacher said it must be because they're on their phones nowadays. But sport's a great way of making friends rather than just being online."" Amelia, 12, added: ""I just think you should give it a go and you don't know until you try."" Jess, 12, enjoys swimming the most: ""I also enjoy girls' rugby but it's been stereotyped as a boys' sport. But it's really nice to learn it and discover it's not just for boys."" Sport Wales said it would work with local authorities and sport governing bodies over the next 18 months to understand the reasons behind the fall. Owen Hathway, the head of insight and policy at Sport Wales, said: ""It's really encouraging to see the rise in numbers."" He said a lot of work had been done by Disability Sport Wales and BME Sport Cymru to engage specific groups of young people. There are also examples of sports, such as cricket, working with ambassadors from ethnic minority communities, allowing them to adapt to suit different religions by offering different times. ""There is however, still a lot of work to be done. There are still groups where the gap is not closing,"" he added. While overall participation levels have remained stable since the last survey, enjoyment of sport both in and out of school has fallen. Chief executive of Sport Wales Sarah Powell said: ""Without it, there is no hope of them having a positive lifelong relationship with sport."" The survey found that on average 99 minutes per week were allocated to PE in schools in Wales - below the two-hour Welsh Government recommendation - although 96% of the children surveyed said they wanted to do more sport. Ms Powell added she would work with schools including looking at introducing less traditional sports into the curriculum.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"South Korea to pardon 1,800 conscientious objectors","It comes after a court last year recognised ""conscience or religious beliefs"" as a justifiable reason to turn down military service. All able-bodied men in South Korea are required to serve for up to 24 months by the time they are 28. Conscientious objectors faced 18 months in prison and often struggled to find employment. One objector who is on parole will be exempt from the remaining penalty. All the others have already been freed, and the pardon allows them to correct their criminal records. Rights groups say conscientious objectors face social stigma in Korea - and struggle to find employment after their jail sentence. An ""alternative"" non-military service - lasting three years and taking place in prisons or ""correctional facilities"" - is being introduced next year. Monday's announcement was the third round of special pardons since President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017. More than 5,000 people were pardoned in total, including 267 who breached election law, and three political and labour activists, the justice ministry said. The government said the move would help convicts return to society. How does conscription work in Korea? South Korea shares a tense relationship - and one of the world's most heavily-fortified borders - with North Korea, and conscription is seen as key to the country's defence. Able-bodied Korean men are required to serve in the army for 21 months, the navy for 23 months, or the air force for 24 months. Male conscription has been law for decades, and conscientious objectors have been arrested and subject to punishment. They face 18 months in jail. Earlier this year, it was confirmed that pop group BTS would not be exempt - despite fans calling for special treatment. South Korea's footballers - including Tottenham forward Son Heung-min - received exemptions after winning the Asian Games tournament. In 2018, a landmark court ruling recognised the need for an alternative service - that did not involve the use of firearms or other weapons - for those with faith-based objections. After the ruling, charges against hundreds of men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to serve, were dropped. The government released from prison hundreds of men who were already serving jail time and had exhausted all their appeals. Last week, parliament passed a new law that allows conscientious objectors to do alternative service - but it was criticised by rights group Amnesty International. ""Confining people to work in a prison - and for almost twice as long as the typical military service - does not respect their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,"" said Arnold Fang, their east Asia researcher.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook launches initiative to fight online hate speech,"It comes a week after the social network announced steps of its own to remove terrorist-related content from its site. The UK Online Civil Courage Initiative's initial partners include Imams Online and the Jo Cox Foundation. Facebook has faced criticism for being slow to react to terrorist propaganda on its platforms. ""The recent terror attacks in London and Manchester - like violence anywhere - are absolutely heartbreaking,"" said Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. ""No-one should have to live in fear of terrorism - and we all have a part to play in stopping violent extremism from spreading. ""We know we have more to do - but through our platform, our partners and our community we will continue to learn to keep violence and extremism off Facebook."" Increasing pressure In recent months, governments across Europe have been pushing for technology companies to take more action to prevent online platforms from being used to spread extremist propaganda. In particular, security services have criticised Facebook, Twitter and Google for relying too much on other people to report inappropriate content, rather than spotting it themselves. In April, Germany passed a bill to fine social networks up to €50m (£44m) if they failed to give users the option to report hate speech and fake news, or if they refused to remove illegal content flagged as either images of child sexual abuse or inciting terrorism. Following the London Bridge terror attack, UK PM Theresa May announced that new international agreements needed to be introduced to regulate the internet in order to ""deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online"". And last week in Paris, Mrs May and French President Emmanuel Macron launched a joint campaign to look at how they could make the internet safe, including making companies legally liable if they refused to remove certain content. Other efforts Similar initiatives to counter hate speech were launched in Germany in January 2016 and in France in March 2017. They have held training workshops with more than 100 anti-hate and anti-extremism organisations across Europe, and reached 3.5 million people online through its Facebook page. In the UK, people are being encouraged to visit the UK OCCI Facebook page, to share stories, content and ideas, and use the hashtag #civilcourage. Brendan Cox, the widower of murdered MP Jo Cox and the founder of the Jo Cox Foundation, has welcomed the move. ""This is a valuable and much needed initiative from Facebook in helping to tackle extremism,"" he said. ""Anything that helps push the extremists even further to the margins is greatly welcome. Social media platforms have a particular responsibility to address hate speech that has too often been allowed to flourish online. ""It is critical that efforts are taken by all online service providers and social networks to bring our communities closer together and to further crack down on those that spread violence and hatred online."" The initiative was launched in conjunction with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Jaguar Land Rover extends shutdown over no-deal fears,"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News The UK's biggest carmaker will be idle for an extra week because of fears of disruption at its car and engine plants at Liverpool, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The shutdown during 8 to 12 April will be in addition to a scheduled closure the following week. Britain is due to leave the European Union on 29 March. ""There will be an additional week of production stand-down... due to potential Brexit disruption,"" JLR said in a statement. The company, which is cutting jobs because of a steep fall in sales, has previously warned about the impact of Brexit on its ability to source just-in-time components from mainland Europe. BMW is already planning to close its plant near Oxford for a month after Brexit, while Honda is planning a six-day closure. After Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan was defeated in Parliament last week, fears have grown among some businesses of a no-deal exit. Also on Thursday, Airbus, which makes aircraft wings in the UK, warned it could shift manufacturing from the UK in the event of no deal. JLR said its move had been under consideration for some time, but it was waiting for clarity over the terms of Britain's EU withdrawal. The company said it needed to inform its workers ahead of any holiday and annual leave plans. Future investment JLR has been saying for more than a year that Brexit uncertainty would eventually take its toll on the perception of the UK as a stable and competitive base for global manufacturing. Last July, the company said it needed more certainty around Brexit, and warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would cost the company more than £1.2bn in profit each year. Chief executive Ralf Speth said last year: ""We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome."" JLR employs just under 39,000 workers at sites including Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, and Halewood on Merseyside. Thursday's news follows an announcement earlier this month that JLR is to cut 4,500 jobs under plans to make £2.5bn of cost savings.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
South Yorkshire flooding: Clean-up starts in Bentley,"In the Bentley area of Doncaster, volunteers have turned out to get to work after the streets were flooded during torrential rain last week. A disaster relief appeal has raised more than £285,000 to help people affected in South Yorkshire. The flooding has seen the Christmas lights switch-on in Rotherham cancelled until further notice. Firefighters in the area have also been angered after some of their equipment was vandalised. 'Public be vigilant' ""Unfortunately with events like this, a certain element of the community will always see what they class as an opportunity,"" South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue area manager Simon Dunker said. ""All I'd urge is that members of the public are vigilant and report anything they see as potentially unsavoury."" He said the fire brigade were focusing their efforts on Doncaster this weekend and were being supported by other services. St Peter's Church in Bentley has organised a clean-up effort with volunteers using the Custom Windows and Doors showroom as a hub. Shane Miller from the shop said: ""It's just been phenomenal, from the night of the floods, people wading up to their wastes, kids carrying sandbags, women carrying sandbags, old age people trying to carry sandbags, it's really been overwhelming."" Local mosques are also supporting the relief effort, holding special prayers and collecting donations. Iman Sadaqat Hussain, from the Madina Mosque in Sheffield, said: ""I think this is a great opportunity for the Muslim community to come forward in helping and aiding our fellow citizens and community members. Today, 85% of shops are open at Rotherham's ParkGate centre, where people became stranded due to flooding. Jamie Robinson, from Wilson's Carpets, said: ""It's come at the worst time of year for us because this is our busiest time of the year.

Covid: Welsh Tory leader calls for UK-wide approach to rules,"Andrew RT Davies wants Welsh ministers to work with the UK government to provide ""consistency"" in areas where all four UK chief medical officers ""undoubtedly agree"". Mr Davies said devolution ""shouldn't mean the Welsh Government should always do things differently"". Wales currently has a lower Covid case rate than England and Northern Ireland. The youngest pupils will return to Welsh primary schools the week after the February half-term, but English schools are not set to reopen until the start of March. Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, the first minister said he was ""pleased"" the Welsh Government had ""regular meetings with the UK government every Wednesday - and a number of days in between most weeks now - where we are able to talk about common approaches"". But Mark Drakeford added: ""We will all [four governments in the UK], nonetheless, be calibrating the decisions that we make in the circumstances that we face. ""The number of people falling ill with coronavirus per 100,000 of the population in Wales is falling at the moment every day. ""It's about half the level that is to be seen across the border in England. I wouldn't want to deny Welsh businesses or outdoor attractions the chance of opening earlier if our circumstances allowed that to happen."" Boris Johnson has said he intends to announce plans to ease England's lockdown restrictions from the 22 February. Writing in the Sunday Times, the Conservatives' Senedd leader said his party ""rejects the 'how can Wales be different just for the sake of it' approach of Welsh Labour."" Mr Davies said: ""That doesn't mean each and every decision made by a Conservative government in Wales would be identical to one made by a Conservative government in Westminster. ""But it's time for consistency in areas where all four chief medical officers of the United Kingdom undoubtedly agree, rather than persisting with the professor in the Bay's policy of poking the prime minister in the eye at every turn. ""Like people and business across Wales, we want to cut the politics and see the adoption of a common framework on restrictions."" In his article, Mr Davies referenced a recent YouGov poll conducted in Wales. The poll from January suggested 63% of respondents believed decisions around lockdown measures should happen at the same time for the whole of the UK even if some areas are at different levels than others at reducing the spread of the virus. A separate question asking how coronavirus lockdown rules are decided suggested that 47% believed the UK government should decide the rules for the whole of the UK, 43% said devolved governments should decide the rules, with 10% saying they didn't know.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Lightwater Valley theme park: Boy, 6, 'falls from rollercoaster'","The boy is believed to have fallen from the Twister rollercoaster at Lightwater Valley, near Ripon, in North Yorkshire. Witnesses reported hearing screams and seeing the boy ""hanging backwards"" from the carriage. Police said his condition was not believed to be life-threatening, and the park said the ride was closed and health and safety experts were on site. It added: ""We take the health and safety of our visitors very seriously and are committed to providing support to the affected family. ""We will continue working closely with the Health and Safety Executive and emergency services."" North Yorkshire Police said it was called to reports of a ""medical incident"" at 11:30 BST and the boy was being treated in Leeds General Infirmary. Lara-Susan James, who was in the queue for the Twister, said: ""We could hear a girl screaming, and I mean screaming. ""I thought she was just scared of being on the ride, but she was hysterical. They were part of a bigger party of people visiting the park, and they were on the ground just ahead of us."" She added: ""They started shouting to the operator to stop the ride. It was at that moment I realised something was wrong. ""I saw the operator apply the emergency stop and my husband pointed to the fallen kid on the ground saying they had fallen out."" Mark Charnley, another guest at the park, said the boy was ""hanging backwards outside the actual carriage"". ""Everybody started shouting to get the attention of the guy running the machine,"" he added. In June 2001, 20-year-old Gemma Savage died when two cars collided on the same ride at the park. Miss Savage, from Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, was on a day out with friends from Durham University, where she was studying medical sciences, when the accident happened. The theme park's owner, the manufacturers of the ride and an electrician were all later fined for health and safety breaches. According to the theme park's website, Lightwater Valley started life as a pig farm located approximately five miles from Ripon. The park as it is known today was born after the purchase and creation of the Rat Rollercoaster in 1987, which at the time became the world's first and only subterranean rollercoaster.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Fellowes and his three brothers were accepted into the family ""because we were four phials of the sacred blood"". They would be invited for tea with their great-aunts, but their mother was never asked to stay. ""When you're a child you don't know what's going on, but gradually I started to understand the game that was being played,"" Fellowes says. Seeing his mother reduced to tears woke him up to the ""cruelty"" and arbitrary nature of the entire system. ""You may be brilliant, you may be one of the great brains of your generation, but you are initially overlooked and dismissed,"" he says. ""I'm not a socialist politically, but I do have this sense of the wastage of people's lives."" This underpinned his scripts for Downton Abbey - and also Gosford Park, the 2001 Robert Altman film for which Fellowes won a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Nonetheless, Fellowes has had to fend off accusations that he is nostalgic for a lost era of country houses and everyone knowing their place. ""All reforms are double-bladed and some things go that, if you are honest, were rather nice,"" he tells Couric. ""There is a limit to how much you can throw a kind of pink cloud over the past."" While it used to be fashionable to say that the British class system had died out, it still persists, he says. ""It's still an advantage - you're going to be educated very well and people are going to help you get into whatever industry or businesses you want. Your parents are going to ring up and say, 'Bobby. I don't want to be a nuisance, but I've got my son coming for an interview on Tuesday...'"" Although Fellowes says ""we are more American than we used to be"" he expresses concern about the lack of social mobility in the UK. ""A lot of people are not being sufficiently educated, not being given sufficient confidence, not being given the tools - all of that I dislike, I resent."" He talks about his years as an aspiring actor, in which he auditioned for the US TV series Fantasy Island and Hollywood's ""only unsuccessful dinosaur film"". He also explains why he's not completely comfortable with Peter Morgan's portrayal of the Royal Family in The Crown. Couric also asks the Conservative peer about Brexit, how he feels about the Duchess of Sussex and why Downton's Matthew Crawley had to die. You can listen to their full conversation here.

Migrant crisis: UK government response branded 'inadequate',"In a letter to the PM, the group of 27 charities - including Oxfam and Amnesty International - say the UK should take a ""proportionate"" share of refugees. They praise the commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years but say more needs to be done. A government spokesman said the UK has a ""long and proud history of offering sanctuary"" to those in genuine need. 'Too slow, too low' The letter, coordinated by the British Refugee Council, asks Mr Cameron to show a ""new resolve"" to deal with the crisis, which saw nearly 4,000 people drown last year and hundreds of thousands more face danger and hardship while fleeing violence. The group, which also includes the International Rescue Committee, Liberty and ActionAid, wrote: ""Last year's announcement that the UK will resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years was a welcome first step, but given the numbers of people searching for safety across the globe, this response is clearly inadequate: it is too slow, too low and too narrow. ""The UK can and should be doing much more to ensure that refugees are not compelled to take life-threatening journeys or forced into smugglers' hands."" They endorse principles set out by 350 former judges and lawyers in October which include taking a fair share of refugees and establishing safe and legal routes to the UK for those seeking protection. Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: ""There are no easy answers to a humanitarian crisis of this magnitude. ""However, the solution must not be to spend another year impassively watching on while desperate people drown or are forced to endure a march of misery across the continent as they try to find a safe haven or to be reunited with their loved ones. ""This year the prime minister must open his heart and show true statesmanship by welcoming far more refugees to the UK, enabling them to travel here safely and legally to live lives free from violence, tyranny and oppression."" 'Life-saving aid' The government spokesman said: ""The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need our protection, with each claim for asylum judged on its individual merits. ""The terrible images we have seen in the last year have moved us all, strengthening our resolve to help prevent more people suffering such a fate. ""That is why we are resettling people directly from the countries neighbouring Syria, to which so many refugees have fled, and we have already met our target of welcoming 1,000 of the most vulnerable before Christmas."" He said the government was also providing ""life-saving aid to those most in need"", both in and around Syria and in Europe, and working with other countries to ""ensure systems are in place which properly address unfounded claims for asylum"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Quebec City mosque shooting: Six killed, eight wounded","Shots were fired at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre on Sunday night, where more than 50 people had gathered for evening prayers. One suspect was arrested at the scene and another was arrested nearby. Police do not believe there are other suspects at large. The Canadian authorities are treating the shooting as a terror attack. ""We condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. ""Muslim-Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country."" Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard also referred to the shooting as a terrorist attack. The dead were aged between about 35 and 70 years old, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said. Some of those injured were in a serious condition, she said. Police said the area was secure and the situation was ""under control"". Thirty-nine people had left the mosque safely, they said. The Quebec authorities have not identified the suspects, but Radio Canada quoted a source close to the investigation as saying that they were students at Laval University in Quebec City and one was of Moroccan origin. An eyewitness told the radio station that two hooded people had burst into the mosque. One opened fire on those praying and shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", Arabic for ""God is Great"". One of the suspects fled the scene in a vehicle but was arrested on a bridge leading to Orleans Island, local media reported. The suspect had called the police himself, Radio Canada said. Automatic weapons and handguns were recovered by police, Journal de Quebec reported. The president of the mosque, Mohamed Yangui - who was not inside at the time - said the shooting had happened in the men's section of the mosque. ""Why is this happening here? This is barbaric,"" he said. On its Facebook page the centre thanked the public ""for the hundreds of messages of compassion"". In June last year the same mosque was the target of an Islamophobic incident when a pig's head was left in front of the building, with a card saying ""bonne appetit"".

Amanda Todd: Memorial for teenage cyberbullying victim,"A memorial for Amanda Todd was held overnight in British Columbia, five days after she was found dead. It comes five weeks after she uploaded a video to YouTube describing years of bullying that she said drove her to drugs and alcohol. In the nine-minute video she told her story with a set of handwritten notes. The recording, described as ""haunting"", showed the cheerleader going into detail about what happened to her. She said she was persuaded to expose her breasts to a stranger who then sent the photo to her school friends. 'I need someone' These images were then used to torment her on social media, she revealed. The teenager changed schools repeatedly but that did not stop the bullying and she was physically attacked by classmates. After a violent encounter with another girl, she wrote that she went home and drank bleach. ""It killed me inside and I thought I actually was going to die,"" she said. The last card on the YouTube video reads: ""I have nobody. I need someone. My name is Amanda Todd."" In a comment below the video, Amanda wrote that she was not posting the video for attention. She wanted ""to be an inspiration and to show that I can be strong"". ""Everyone's future will be bright one day, you just gotta pull through. I'm still here, aren't I?"" Christy Clark, premier in British Columbia, posted a video on YouTube offering her condolences and condemning bullying. Amanda Todd's family has not yet spoken publicly about what has happened. Your comments Reaction to the story has been coming in on Newsbeat's Facebook and Twitter accounts. Danny Grey said: ""Sad news indeed, but why didn't she just close her account down, report it or tell the relevant people?"" Josher Oner said: ""I don't understand why this one suicide has gone worldwide, suicides among bullied teenagers happen every day. Is it because she's a pretty young girl?"" Sophie Walls said: ""I watched the video and wish I could have done more. Sadly I don't think this is an isolated case and I fear there are more young girls like this."" Adam Page added: ""Guess the government will use this to try and force through more laws allowing them to spy on electronic communications, when really they should be trying to educate young people what to do in these kind of situations."" @McClairee wrote: ""The best tribute to her we can do is talking to the kid that sits on their own etc. Reach out to people who are being bullied."" @WiiGoCrazy wrote: ""What about all the folk who commit suicide for being ugly, poor, good at something?

Mexican police officers arrested over migrant killings,"The bodies of 19 people were found in a burnt-out vehicle near the US border in Tamaulipas state on 22 January. Most of the victims are believed to have been Central American migrants. Investigators think they were killed as part of a turf war between criminal gangs over control of migrant smuggling routes in the area. Tamaulipas State Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica said the officers would be charged with murder and abuse of power. Who were the victims? Sixteen of the victims were male and one female. Two of the bodies were so badly burned, their sex could not be established. DNA tests have so far shown that two were Mexican nationals and two were Guatemalan. Prosecutors are investigating whether the two Mexicans may have been involved in smuggling the rest of the group to the US. The two Guatemalans so far identified were 22-year-old football player Marvin Tomás and Élfego Roliberto Miranda Díaz. Both are from the town of Comitancillo in Guatemala. The remaining victims are also thought to have been from Guatemala. Forensic tests suggest they were shot before being set alight. What was the alleged role of the police? Few details are available. Prosecutors say that on the day of the killings, several vehicles carrying Guatemalan and Salvadorean migrants to the US were ""escorted by armed individuals"". Mr Barrios Mojica said the crime scene had been ""altered"". He pointed to the fact that the pick-up truck on which the bodies were found had 113 bullet holes but no casing were found. The state attorney general also described the reports filed by the officers as ""contradictory"". What's the background? Killings of migrants are not unusual. In 2010, 72 migrants were killed in San Fernando, also in Tamaulipas state. And in 2012, 49 dismembered bodies were found in Cadereyta in Nuevo León. Both killings are believed to have been carried out by the powerful Zetas cartel. The cartel controls much of the region and is thought to target immigrants who try to cross it without paying the gang for safe passage. The fees paid to people smugglers often exceed $10,000 (£7,330) and competition for the migrants' money is fierce. Municipal and state police officers are often recruited by cartels - either by the offer of large sums or by threats - to turn a blind eye or even provide the cartels with safe passage.

Under-18s face alcohol search,"By Brandice AlexanderNewsbeat reporter in Newquay Teenagers, trains and luggage can all be searched if officers suspect that soneone is carrying booze brought from home. It's part of a crackdown on underage binge drinking in Newquay. The new plans have been brought in after a two teenagers fell to their deaths from cliffs on the coast within the space of a week. Like tens of thousands of teenagers around this time of the year, they'd travelled to Newquay to celebrate the end of their exams. What worries Inspector Dave Meredith from Newquay police is that the area is appealing more and more to under-16s. He says he's seen a rise in 15-year-olds going to Newquay and wants parents to check their childrens' suitcases before they leave home. ""We'll be looking at under-18s arriving in Newquay with bottles of spirits hidden in their suitcases,"" he said. ""We're targeting the trains as they arrive at Newquay working in conjunction with British Transport Police. ""Our own officers will be confiscating alcohol when they get off the trains."" Zero tolerance It's been a long time since Newquay has been remembered for its tea rooms, quaint shops and beautiful beaches, but the recent tragedies have put a lot of pressure on the police to make sure that it doesn't happen again. There's no doubt that Newquay is the place to go for young people looking for a good time. Baby-faced teenagers can be caught swigging vodka and simulating sex on the streets. However, Newquay does maintain a zero tolerance policy to underage drinking. Yet local police say they're realistic about underage drinkers in Newquay. They want more support from parents, and bar owners. They're being criticised, however, for not calling for a complete ban on pub crawls. Police say repsonsibility lies with bar owners because pub crawls are legal. Police say clubs have got a lot stricter when it comes to serving. Teenagers in Newquay told Newsbeat they got the alcohol from home or by paying older clubbers to buy the booze for them. Those who stashed alcohol in their suitcases say the threat of being searched doesn't bother them, but they worry that stop and search could lead to a rise in drugs, as that would be easier to hide. The deaths of the two teenagers in the last 17 days didn't seem to worry the groups Newsbeat spoke to on Tolcarne Beach but it has put the spotlight on Newquay police. They plan to start confiscating booze and searching underage teenagers as soon as possible.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
FM's flood return visit with £2.3m pledge for at-risk communities,"Residents in Tal-y-Bont near Bangor expressed anger last week after the first minister did not show up. Mr Jones has apologised but said he did not know they had been expecting him. He said £2.3m funding to protect communities will be used to help those affected by flooding over Christmas. ""The money's there,"" he said. ""I can't understand why people are saying the money's been refused, it's been there throughout this financial year. ""The issue as I understand it has been the easements to get pipes across people's land. Now that's been resolved, there's no reason the scheme can't move forward."" Mr Jones said the £2.3m for flooding is new cash, handed over to the Welsh government in December as part of the UK's autumn spending statement. On the A55, which also flooded, effectively cutting off north west Wales, he added: ""The problem is that the A55 was built in the 1980s to a much lower standard than it would be today. We're having to put that right. ""The flooding issues on the A55 will be dealt with. The scheme to improve the section between Abergwyngregyn and Tai Meibion was withdrawn by the then minister who preferred to concentrate on north - south schemes. It's now back on the table and work will start in 2017. ""Lots of roads flood. It doesn't mean we shrug our shoulders. The A55 is as important to the north as the M4 is to the south. We want to make sure the roads are as clear as possible."" Resident Eirlys Evans, whose home was hit by the Christmas flooding, last week said she was ""disappointed and disgusted"" about Mr Jones not visiting. She met him on Tuesday and said: ""I hope he will stick to his word and stick by us in the north. We need to get a flood defence now because when it rains, we're petrified. ""I would've thought they would have learnt by the second time. Now it's the third time."" Before visiting Tal-y-Bont, Mr Jones also went to speak to residents at Bontnewydd near Caernarfon.

Dr Michael Watt patient recall hearing off until 2020,"By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent The recall was sparked by concerns over possible misdiagnosis. A preliminary hearing due to be held in June was adjourned. Some charities and patients have voiced concerns at the pace of the investigations and the lack of information on developments. The Medical Practitioners' Tribunal Service (MPTS) hearing was to examine the circumstances surrounding the recall of 3,500 of the neurologist's patients in May 2018. Around the same time that it was adjourned, the Department of Health also cancelled the publication of an outcomes report during which charities, politicians and the media were to be updated on the condition of Dr Watt's patients. The Irish News has reported that Dr Watt is to retire on medical grounds. It is understood the process for that to happen within the Belfast Health Trust has stepped up a gear, as retiring under these circumstances has always been an option open to Dr Watt. Suspended on full pay While thousands of patients have been re-examined, with some receiving a different diagnosis, little light has actually been shed by the authorities on what exactly is happening. What we do know is that in January this year, Dr Watt was suspended from practising as a doctor in the UK by the MPTS, but remained on full pay. It is unclear whether the GMC's investigation would still go ahead if Dr Watt retires on medical grounds. When asked if that was a possibility, a GMC spokesperson told the BBC: ""A doctor's decision to retire or leave their place of employment is separate to the GMC's processes and does not mean an investigation would come to an end."" That would suggest that a doctor could apply to leave the register, but that process is separate to their retirement and an investigation by the GMC could continue. However, the BBC understands that in other cases where a person under investigation retired, the investigation ended. 'Public concern' Meanwhile, the independent review established by the Department of Health in 2018 into the neurology recall continues. To date, it has not reported any findings. At the time, the Department of Health's permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said he was conscious of the level of public interest and concern. He said that a preliminary report would be produced as soon as practicable, with the final report issued on the completion and review of all other relevant actions initiated by the department. The way things are proceeding, that independent review, chaired by Brett Lockhart QC and Dr Hugo Mascie-Taylor, might just be the only show left in town when it comes to examining what exactly happened behind Northern Ireland's biggest patient recall. Sinn Féin health spokesperson Pat Sheehan said that patients were entitled to information and urged the Department of Health to keep them up to date at all stages.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The whales who love to sing in the dark,"By Mary HaltonScience reporter, BBC News While the songs of humpback whales have long received the most attention, it turns out that their baleen cousins could have a far greater repertoire. A study of a bowhead population near Svalbard has shown that their musical calls may be as varied as those of songbirds. This would make them unique among whale populations, and possibly even mammals. Whalesong mixtape Over the course of three years, the whales of the Spitsbergen population produced 184 unique song types. The vocalisations were detected 24 hours a day throughout most of the winter each year. ""The alphabet for the bowhead has got thousands of letters as far as we can tell,"" Prof Kate Stafford, lead author of the study published in the journal Biology Letters, told BBC News. ""I really think of humpback whale songs as being like classical music. Very ordered. They might last 20 - 30 minutes. An individual [bowhead] song might only be 45 seconds to 2 minutes long, but they'll repeat that song over and over again,"" the University of Washington researcher added. Humpback whales are known to sing similar songs across a single season, but for bowheads, song types only lasted a few hours or days before changing. These complex songs are unusual, as most mammals have distinct, repetitive calls which do not vary. Although less is known about bowhead populations, the authors think it likely that males do the singing during the breeding season. With the ability to break through up to half a metre of ice, and a potential lifespan of 200 years, bowheads can seem quite formidable. Yet their blubber, the thickest of any whale species, led to the Spitsbergen population being commercially hunted as early as the 1600s. This reduction in their numbers, and the harsh environment of their natural habitat under the ice, has meant that they are poorly studied and remain somewhat mysterious. Other bowhead groups, such as the Western Arctic population, are better understood thanks to the knowledge of native Alaskans, Prof Stafford explains. Yet she says that overall we know ""relatively little"" about the species. Soloists It is not yet known whether individual bowheads sing the same song for a lifetime, or if they change from season to season. The reason for the diversity of calls in this one population hasn't been determined either. It wasn't possible to count the Spitsbergen group using the hydrophone recordings, but previous work in the region had put the population at a minimum of 343 whales. What remains, says Prof Stafford, is to acoustically track individuals and learn more about who is vocalising, and why. ""It's a mystery that's going to be really hard to solve,"" she said. But being able to eavesdrop under the ice in this remote place... It's pretty remarkable.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Long Covid: Children of the 90s join nationwide study,"The Bristol-based long-term project monitors the health of more than 14,000 participates. Long Covid leaves people struggling with symptoms including fatigue, memory loss and shortness of breath. It is estimated that one in 20 people who catch Covid-19 will still have symptoms after two months. Participants in the long Covid study will wear Fitbit-style devices to measure exercise ability, breathing and heart rate. Researchers will use the data produced to try to find out more about the illness's risk factors, its impact on health, finances and wellbeing, and how best to treat it. Jamie Bridgeman, born in 1991, was one of the first people to take part in the Children of the 90s study. The 29-year-old is still suffering from long Covid after becoming infected in April. ""I have days where I am very breathless and lethargic,"" he said. ""Some days you physically can't get out of bed, you can't go up the stairs, it is a real effort. ""It is getting better but it is taking a lot of time. ""Long Covid is a really serious thing. I have it quite mild, but there are people out there that are really struggling with it."" Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires on mental health and cognitive function and will also be invited to a London clinic for scans to look at potential damage to their vital organs. Professor Nic Timpson, principal investigator at Children of the 90s, said the study was bringing together national health records and hospital studies covering more than 60 million people with the data gathered over the lives of the Bristol participants. ""Bristol's Children of the 90s participants should be proud that through their contribution, this study will enable better diagnostic tools for long Covid, and a clearer understanding of the condition itself,"" he said.

"Eurozone business growth slows in September, PMI survey finds","The latest Markit Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.3 from August's 52.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Modest growth in Europe's biggest economy, Germany, provided some cheer, but the eurozone was brought down by stagnation elsewhere, particularly in France, where PMI fell to 49.1. Manufacturing across the eurozone fared worse than the service sector, with the PMI reading falling to 50.5, the lowest measure since July of last year. ""The survey paints a picture of ongoing malaise in the eurozone economy,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. ""With growth of output and demand slowing, employment once again failed to show any meaningful increase. Such torpor meant prices continued to fall as firms fought for customers, which will inevitably heighten concerns that the region is facing deflation."" He added that the European Central Bank (ECB), which is faced with the task of warding off deflation, would be ""disappointed"" by the PMI numbers. 'Anaemic demand' On Monday, ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank was ready to use ""additional unconventional instruments"" to help boost the flagging eurozone economy, ""should it become necessary to further address risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation"". Earlier this month, the European Central Bank introduced new measures to stimulate the area's flagging economy. As well as launching an asset purchase programme, through which it will buy debt products from banks, the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.05%. Business growth in France slumped to a three-year low, with both the manufacturing and service sectors suffering. ""Anaemic demand continues to hold back the private sector,"" said Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit, ""with further price cutting insufficient to prevent new orders from falling"". In Germany, service sector growth rebounded to a two-month high, but manufacturing growth recorded its slowest growth for 15 months. Markit economists also raised concerns about the crisis in Ukraine, and related Russian sanctions, which they warned could have further adverse effects on business in Europe. ""The danger is that the ECB's efforts to stimulate the economy will prove ineffective in the face of such headwinds, which are exacerbating already-weak demand,"" said Mr Williamson.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus card payments: Thousands back Birds bakery manager,"Megan Metcalfe was sacked in June after she paid for customers' purchases with her own card so they could use cash. Ms Metcalfe, 60, had worked at the Birds bakery in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire for 44 years. The firm said Ms Metcalfe had been fired ""with regret"" but she had broken its coronavirus policies. Two petitions have called for the bakery to reinstate Ms Metcalfe and accept cash payments, with more than 9,000 signatures on one and 14,000 signatures on the other. Ms Metcalfe took 45 cash payments from customers totalling £183 over several weeks. ""I was made to feel really bad for helping lots of people,"" she said. ""These are the people that have been shopping with them for years and keeping their business up, and for them to just want to turn them away is disgusting. ""They [Birds] are not going to reinstate me, but they haven't made any form of apology to these customers. ""Not everybody wants to use card payments. Some people don't want a card and some aren't allowed one."" Ms Metcalfe now has a job at a care home but said it was ""wonderful"" to have support through the petitions. One of the organisers, Katherine Clarke, said people were ""disgusted and outraged"". ""Everyone is so angry about the way she has been treated,"" she said. ""She was only trying to help her community."" Ms Clarke urged the bakery to look at ways to ""safely handle cash payments"". ""Don't discriminate against people that don't have a bank card, especially the elderly as that's their main customer demographic,"" she added. CEO Lesley Bird said it regretted that Ms Metcalfe had to ""leave the business"" but handling money was a risk to staff. ""A lot of our customer base are the elderly and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe,"" she added. ""Like many other food outlets, during this pandemic we have asked customers to only use debit cards because notes and coins are not clean.""

Trayvon Martin texts and tweets limited in Zimmerman trial,"Details about slain 17-year-old Trayvon Martin's cannabis use, school suspension and fights cannot be used in opening statements, the judge said. George Zimmerman's lawyers argued those would show he acted in self-defence. Mr Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder. In Sanford, Florida, Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused a request from the defence to delay the trial, now scheduled to begin on 10 June. ""We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with the event,"" said Mr Zimmerman's defence lawyer Mark O'Mara. ""It could have affected his behaviour.'' 'Attempt to influence' Neither side will be allowed to mention Martin's alleged role in fights, nor his drug use, nor other allegations pertaining to his character in their opening statements, the judge ruled. But she allowed that some of the evidence and testimony about it could be permissible later, depending on how the trial progressed. Last week, Mr Zimmerman's defence lawyers released to the public text message exchanges from Martin's mobile phone in which he appeared to discuss fights, a suspension from school, marijuana use and possibly buying a gun. After Tuesday's hearing, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Martin's family, said the personal information about Martin was ""not relevant"" and ""inadmissible"" as evidence. ""We think it was strategic when this information was released after the jury summons went out,"" Mr Crump told reporters. ""It was calculated, we believe, to sway and pollute and influence the jury."" Also in Tuesday's hearing, the judge said she would not allow jurors selected for the case to travel to the scene of the shooting during the trial. The panel will not be sequestered during jury selection either, although defence lawyers argued such a measure would be necessary since the case has a high public profile. In February 2012, Martin was walking from a shop to his father's home when the deadly confrontation with Mr Zimmerman occurred. 'Stand your ground' Mr Zimmerman had been sitting in his vehicle watching a neighbourhood street when he saw Martin and deemed him suspicious. He telephoned authorities, then left his vehicle to pursue Martin. Florida police did not arrest Mr Zimmerman for six weeks after the shooting. He has denied he intended to shoot Martin, claiming the teenager became aggressive and threatened him and that he drew his legally carried gun and shot in self-defence. The case drew national attention because the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law grants individuals wide latitude to use deadly force if they feel seriously in danger. Mr Zimmerman's lawyers have opted not to cite that law in their defence.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Flood warnings as more storms forecast for New Year's Day,"The Environment Agency said communities in Cumbria and parts of southern England were particularly at risk. Hundreds of households are still recovering from storms that caused floods and power cuts over Christmas. Scottish and Southern Energy customers who faced a prolonged blackout will be entitled to compensation payments. A statement on the company's website said domestic and business customers without power for 48 hours could claim £54 - double the statutory requirement - plus an extra £54 for every subsequent 12 hours. In total, 130,000 customers had power restored, but this was mostly within 48 hours. A spokeswoman was unable to say how many customers would be eligible for payments. Another company, UK Power Networks, which maintains electric lines in London, the South East and eastern England, said it would pay £75 to customers who experienced 48-60 hour blackouts including Christmas Day. Meanwhile, Commons energy select committee chairman Tim Yeo has said the bosses of the UK's energy distribution companies are to face questioning by MPs about the power cuts and Energy Secretary Ed Davey has summoned them to an ""urgent meeting"" next week. It comes after more than 150,000 properties across the UK were left without power, many for several days, during the storms over Christmas. Mr Yeo said it was ""ludicrous"" that some people had to wait five days for their power to be restored. Emergency accommodation In light of the latest forecasts, local authorities have been preparing emergency accommodation. Travel Check if this is affecting your journey The Local Government Association urged people to look on council websites in England and Wales for details of emergency accommodation in case rising waters force them from their homes. The Environment Agency has issued seven flood warnings for England and Wales, meaning flooding is expected and immediate action is required. Counties at increased risk of flooding are Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Cumbria. ""On New Year's Day, heavy rain is expected which could cause flooding to communities in the south-east and south-west of England,"" an agency spokeswoman said. ""There is a heightened flood risk for parts of south-east, southern and south-west England and Cumbria."" The Met Office has issued yellow warnings - meaning ""be aware"" - for rain for areas across the UK. Helicopter rescue BBC Weather's Matt Taylor said that although north-eastern areas would start dry, gale force winds and heavy rain would sweep in from the south-west and Wales. The latest warnings came as a clean-up operation began in south and west Scotland following widespread flooding. About 150 people were evacuated from their properties after torrential rain on Monday, with Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire particularly badly hit. Seven people were airlifted by a Royal Navy helicopter from a farmhouse near Closeburn in Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway, on Monday after torrential rains caused extensive disruption. And three people were rescued by firefighters at Whitesands in Dumfries after they were cut off by the deep floodwater and rising river.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Plebgate': Andrew Mitchell blasts media,"He quit as Tory chief whip after it was alleged he called Downing Street police officers ""plebs"", which he denies. Further doubt has recently been cast on officers' accounts of his behaviour. Mr Mitchell told Channel 4's Dispatches programme his treatment by the press had been ""completely wrong"". The coverage - which included demands for his resignation - made it appear that the Leveson Inquiry into media standards, including relations with the police, ""had never even taken place"", he argued. While Mr Mitchell admits swearing after a police officer refused to let him exit through the main Downing Street gate with his bicycle on 19 September last year, he denies directly swearing at the officer and insists he did not lose his temper or call him a ""pleb"". CCTV footage has cast doubt on the original police accounts of the row. Four people have been arrested in an investigation into their handling and reporting of the episode. Mr Mitchell told Dispatches, which is due to be broadcast on Monday, night: ""I was caught between the pincers of the police on the one hand and the media on the other in a way that would lead you to believe that the Leveson Inquiry had never even taken place. ""I think that was completely wrong and it led to my demise."" Prime Minister David Cameron repeated his desire last week for a ""thorough"" inquiry into the Downing Street altercation. Steve White, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, attempted to distance the national organisation from the fierce criticism of Mr Mitchell that came from some of its local spokesmen at the time. He told BBC One's Sunday Politics: ""The national Police Federation accepted Andrew Mitchell's apology and we wanted to move on. ""The fact of the matter is there are a number of police federations in the West Midlands that felt there were still questions to answer."" Mr Mitchell also criticised Number 10's handling of the situation in the days following the incident. But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister wanted to keep Andrew Mitchell in his job, and was very supportive of him. ""At the time Andrew Mitchell apologised to the police and chose not to make a complaint to the IPCC - a path which was always available to him. ""The prime minister takes full responsibility for the way the case was handled and has said repeatedly that what matters now is that the police get to the bottom of this matter.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Windows Phone 8 system update announced by Microsoft,"Windows Phone 8 shares much of its code with the firm's PC system, making it easier for developers to write programs for different types of devices. The company said it should mean there would be some ""amazing games"" for handsets running its new release. A tie-up with Nokia has already brought several Windows Phone devices to market, but sales lag some way behind models running Android or Apple's iOS. Microsoft said Nokia, Samsung, HTC and Huawei would all be making devices powered by the system upgrade. High-def handsets Other new features announced at the Windows Phone Summit event in San Francisco included: Background Skype The update also allows internet call software based on VoIP (voice over internet protocol) and video chat technologies to run in the background. This addresses a complaint that the firm's own Skype program could not be used to receive calls while its owner was using another application - a function offered on rival platforms. The firm said VoIP calls should now ""feel like any other call"" made or received by Windows Phone handsets. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 strongly resemble each other - at least when the PC system is run under its Metro interface - and Microsoft was keen to stress that their relationship goes deeper than appearance alone. The two will share a range of components including graphic drivers, the DirectX collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) and the NT kernel that ties application software to the hardware it is installed on. They can also both support native code in the C and C++ programming languages. Microsoft said this should not only make it easier to port software between the two environments, but should speed up the time it takes developers to recode programs originally built for iOS and Android. More games Microsoft noted more than 100,000 apps had been released for Windows Phone 7. By contrast there are more than 466,500 programs in the Android marketplace according to search site Appbrain , and ""over 500,000"" in Apple's app store according to the iPhone maker. Securing ""marquee titles"" is more important to some than raw numbers, and Microsoft addressed this too with news that Gameloft's Nova 3 and Zynga's Draw Something were coming to Windows Phone. ""Until now handsets running Microsoft's system have been missing some of the most innovative applications and popular games,"" said Malik Saadi, principal analyst at Informa Telecoms. ""Now with the update from Windows Phone 7 to 8 this should be addressed. Many of the developers I had spoken to had said they were holding off until they knew more about the new system. It looks like that barrier has now gone.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chronic fatigue syndrome on rise among 16-year-olds,"Persistent exhaustion was found to affect 2% of 16-year-olds - and almost twice as many girls as boys. Children from poorer families were also more likely to have the condition. The Bristol study, published in Pediatrics, asked more than 5,700 parents and their children about their experiences of persistent exhaustion. Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME, is a debilitating disease which has a major impact on the lives of those affected. It causes persistent fatigue that does not go away with rest or sleep. This large population study found that one in 50 16-year-olds have CFS/ME lasting more than six months and nearly one in 33 have CFS/ME persisting for more than three months. Yet only one in 1,000 are diagnosed with the condition. Not yuppie flu In the study, those with CFS/ME missed, on average, more than half a day of school every week. Boys and girls appeared to be equally affected at the age of 13, but by the time they were 16, CFS/ME was more common in girls. Children from families with poor housing, financial difficulties and a lack of support for their mother were more likely to report problems of severe fatigue. The study authors said this dispelled the commonly held view that CFS/ME was a ""middle-class"" illness, or ""yuppie flu"". The diagnoses of the condition in the study were based on responses to questionnaires sent to teenagers and their parents, and were not made by a doctor. Dr Esther Crawley, senior report author and consultant paediatrician specialising in CFS/ME, said treatment for teenagers with the condition was effective but few had access to treatment in the UK. ""Children attending my specialist service only attend two days a week of school on average. This means that only the most severe cases are getting help. ""As paediatricians, we need to get better at identifying CFS/ME, particularly in those children from disadvantaged backgrounds who may be less able to access specialist care."" 'Disabling symptoms' She said experts still did not know exactly why or how the condition is triggered, but research showed it could be successfully treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in young people. Sonya Chowdhury, chief executive of Action for ME, said the study pointed to the need for more effective treatments. ""We know from contact with the parents of children with ME that this disabling condition impacts on every area of family life. ""The reality is that many young people miss considerably more than half a day of school a week, while for the most severely affected, their disabling symptoms are compounded by the isolation and loss that comes with being housebound and/or bedbound.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Madhya Pradesh accident: Dozens dead as bus plunges into canal in India,"Some 60 people were on board when the packed bus veered off a bridge and fell into the canal on Tuesday in Sidhi district. Officials say that seven passengers, including the driver, managed to swim to the shore. Rescue teams are looking for the remaining passengers. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the accident. Eyewitnesses say that the driver lost control and the bus hit the boundary of the bridge before falling into the Sharda canal. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that two ministers were heading to the site of the accident to monitor rescue efforts. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted, expressing his condolences for the families of the victims. He also announced compensation for the victims' families as well as those who have been injured in the accident. The bus was on its way from Sidhi to Satna district. Buses are a common mode of transport between smaller towns and districts in India. But operators often flout safety rules and pack them beyond their capacity. Some 150,000 people are killed on India's roads every year - the highest in the world - mainly due to speeding and careless driving. More than 350,000 people are disabled annually in these accidents. Men and women, aged between 18 and 45 years, make up 70% of the fatalities, according to federal transport minister Nitin Gadkari. ""For the government, each life is precious, whether poor or rich, urban or rural, male or female. The situation is alarming… there are more deaths [in road accidents] than in Covid… It is more dangerous than Covid,"" Mr Gadkari said at the weekend. He said the government was carrying out a ""safety audit"" of 40,000km (24,854 miles) of highways to find out whether there were any design deficiencies which were contributing to the accidents. As high as 44% of households in rural areas reported at least one death after a road crash compared with 11.6% of households in urban areas, according to a new World Bank report. The report, done in collaboration with SaveLIFE Foundation, a non-profit group working on road safety, said more than 75% of poor households in India reported a decline in their income as a result of a road traffic crash. The financial loss for the poor amounted to more than seven months' household income, while it was equivalent to less than one month's household income for rich households, the report said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Walkers warned over dangers of cows in fields with calves,"Jacqui Beale, 48, from Derbyshire, suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung, and was left needing stitches to her face when she was attacked while walking her dog. She and another victim, from West Yorkshire, are taking legal action. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said walkers ""must be most aware of the issues"" in the countryside. Ms Beale said she thought she was going to die when she was attacked by eight cows in May. The dog groomer, from Wirksworth, added: ""I was bashed about by about eight cows. I remember being tossed from one to another and thinking I wasn't going to survive. ""All I could hear was snorting and breathing, it was terrifying."" Ms Beale, whose dog was on a lead at the time of the attack in May, managed to get herself to safety and now wants to warn others. Avoiding a cow attack Source: National Farmers' Union Grandfather-of-five Mike Pace, from Huddersfield, was trampled while walking along a public footpath with his wife Gill on holiday in Abersoch in Gwynedd, Wales, in August. The 55-year-old said: ""This black bullock that had been staring looking menacing charged me and threw me up in the air and then the other cattle just started trampling me. ""While on the floor I had a conversation with myself thinking I was going to die. I told myself I'd had a good life."" Mrs Pace escaped unharmed, but her husband spent more than a month in hospital and still needs crutches to walk. Sally Gray, a personal injury specialist at Slater and Gordon, is representing a number of people who have been injured by cattle. ""When it comes to public liability and the risk owed to the public, farmers have been advised not to put calves and their mothers in fields that are open to the public together,"" she added. A spokesperson for the NFU said: ""The countryside is a working environment where animals graze so it's important that people are mindful of this. ""Spring and summer are when we love to enjoy the countryside, so it is this time of year when walkers must be most aware of the issues.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Farage defends 'rough diamond' former UKIP candidate,"Kerry Smith stood down as the candidate for South Basildon and East Thurrock in 2015 after a recording emerged of him using the term and other offensive language about gay people. The UKIP leader said he would never use the term but ""a lot of people would"". He said he was a ""bit sorry"" for Mr Smith, calling him a ""rough diamond"". But Mr Farage told LBC Radio that Mr Smith - who resigned from UKIP after the recorded comments were published in a Sunday newspaper - was ""not a suitable candidate"" for the party and the remarks had been ""loutish"". Mr Smith, who stood for the party in the 2010 general election, has apologised for the remarks, in which he referred to a woman as a ""chinky bird"" and to ""old poofter groups"". The party said the comments were made some time ago after he had been prescribed sedatives after an injury. But Mr Smith has insisted that the language was no worse than used on TV shows like Only Fools and Horses. Asked about the use of the word ""chinky"" on his regular radio phone-in by presenter Nick Ferrari, Mr Farage replied: ""If you and your mates are going out for a Chinese, what would you say you are going for?"" 'Colloquial' When challenged further, the UKIP leader said he would never use that word but ""a lot of people would"". Mr Farage accepted that Mr Smith's comments were ""loutish"" but he insisted they were not made with malice. ""I'm a bit sad, because Kerry Smith is a rough diamond,"" he said. ""He's a council house boy from the East End of London, left school early and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do. ""I feel a bit sorry for Kerry Smith, because I think he's a genuine fellow."" He added: ""I think we are very snobbish in London about condemning people for the colloquial language they use, particularly if it's not meant with really unpleasant intent. ""Kerry himself said that he used language that Del Boy used to use on Only Fools and Horses, and nobody objected then.""

Guinea Ebola outbreak: Bat-eating banned to curb virus,"Bats, a local delicacy, appeared to be the ""main agents"" for the Ebola outbreak in the south, Rene Lamah said. Sixty-two people have now been killed by the virus in Guinea, with suspected cases reported in neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by close contact. There is no known cure or vaccine. It kills between 25% and 90% of victims, depending on the strain of the virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Symptoms include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting. 'Quarantine sites' It is the first time Ebola has struck Guinea, with recent outbreaks thousands of miles away, in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr Lamah announced the ban on the sale and consumption of bats during a tour of Forest Region, the epicentre of the epidemic, reports the BBC's Alhassan Sillah from the capital, Conakry. People who eat the animals often boil them into a sort of spicy pepper soup, our correspondent says. The soup is sold in village stores where people gather to drink alcohol. Other ways of preparing the bats to eat include drying them over a fire. Certain species of bat found in West and Central Africa are thought to be the natural reservoir of Ebola, although they do not show any symptoms. Health officials reported one more death on Tuesday, bringing the number of people killed by Ebola to 62, our correspondent adds. The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has set up two quarantine sites in southern Guinea to try to contain the outbreak, the Associated Press news agency reports. Health authorities are receiving help from the WHO while messages are being broadcast on national television to reassure people. Sierra Leone's health ministry said it was investigating two suspected cases of Ebola. ""We still do not have any confirmed cases of Ebola in the country,"" its chief medical officer Brima Kargbo told AFP. ""What we do have are suspected cases, which our health teams are investigating and taking blood samples from people who had come in contact with those suspected to have the virus,"" he added. Mr Kargbo said one suspected case involved a 14-year-old boy buried in a Sierra Leonean village after he apparently died across the border in Guinea two weeks ago, AFP reports. The other patient was still alive in the northern border district of Kambia, he added. Five people are reported to have died in Liberia after crossing from southern Guinea for treatment, Liberia's Health Minister Walter Gwenigale told journalists on Monday. However, it is not clear whether they had Ebola. Outbreaks of Ebola occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, the World Health Organization says.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hundreds of tonnes of clinical and human waste piles up,"Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) ceased trading after being caught up in a row over stockpiling medical waste. Latest estimates suggest up to 300 tonnes of clinical waste and 10 tonnes of anatomical waste are piled up at the HES plants in Dundee and Shotts, North Lanarkshire. Specialist teams will be needed to clear the waste. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham told MSPs the majority of the human waste was at the firm's Shotts headquarters and any clearance operation was likely to cost about £250,000. The collapse of HES, which previously had the NHS Scotland waste collection contract, saw 150 workers in Scotland lose their jobs and forced contingency measures to be put in place across the health service. The Scottish government said these measures were working well but photographs showing bags of clinical waste piled at three health centres in North Lanarkshire have been posted on social media. Ms Cunningham told Holyrood that the best available evidence suggests there was a backlog of between 250 and 300 tonnes of clinical waste and 10 tonnes of anatomical waste at HES sites in Scotland. She added: ""Sepa (Scottish Environment Protection Agency) has been closely monitoring and inspecting the HES sites in Dundee and Shotts, including weekly inspections since December to ensure they comply with relevant environmental legislation. ""Enforcement notices were issued to HES in September and December 2018, however further scrutiny has established that the company has not fully met the requirements of notices. ""Subsequently Sepa has commenced an investigation to establish if criminal offences have been committed. Contingency measures ""Sepa has also robustly reviewed the contingency arrangements in place at affected NHS sites to ensure all regulatory requirements are met and will continue to monitor all the affected sites to ensure the environment and local communities remain safeguarded."" HES lost its contract to provide waste processing services with NHS England after reports emerged in October last year that human body parts and other clinical waste was piling up after the company struggled to incinerate it. In December last year, NHS Scotland announced that the firm would not have its contract continued north of the border when it came up for renewal in April this year. Contingency measures were put in place which saw a string of temporary contractors take over the HES work to ensure clinical waste continued to be disposed of safely. There have since been reports of a backlog of waste at some NHS sites and in Inverness, four porters at Raigmore Hospital were injured carrying out work involving clinical waste. However, the Scottish government has insisted the contingency measures are working well.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Syria's Assad: Aleppo a 'springboard' to winning the war,"In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Mr Assad said there was no choice but to ""keep cleaning this area"" and force rebels ""back"" to Turkey. Syria and its ally Russia have stepped up bombardment of rebel-held eastern Aleppo in recent weeks. Meanwhile a bomb attack near Syria's border with Turkey has left many dead. At least 17 people, mainly rebels of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), were killed in the car bomb blast at a rebel checkpoint near Azaz in the northern province of Aleppo, activists and monitors said. No group has yet said it carried out the attack. Earlier this month, so-called Islamic State (IS) killed at least 29 people, most of them Islamist rebel fighters, in a bombing at the rebel-controlled Atmeh crossing, in Idlib province to the west. Azaz sits between territory controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces to its west and by IS to its east. 'No other option' In a lengthy interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, President Assad said retaking Aleppo could help him win the war. ""It's going to be the springboard, as a big city, to move to another areas, to liberate another areas from the terrorists,"" he said, referring to the rebels. ""You have to keep cleaning this area and to push the terrorists to Turkey, to go back to where they come from or to kill them. There's no other option,"" he said. Turkey is a key backer of rebel groups, along with Western powers and Gulf states. In August, Turkish forces crossed into Syria in an ongoing operation to push Kurdish fighters and IS away from its border. Mr Assad branded Turkey's actions an ""invasion, against international law, against the morals, against the sovereignty of Syria"". Meanwhile, in a fresh diplomatic push, the US and Russia are to resume talks this weekend on trying to resolve the nearly six-year war. US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are expected to meet counterparts from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in Lausanne on Saturday. Mr Kerry will also hold talks in London on Sunday with foreign ministers from Britain, France and Germany. It comes almost two weeks after the US suspended dialogue with Russia over Syria after an intensification of air strikes on Aleppo. The city has been roughly divided between the government-held west and rebel-held east since 2012 and has become a key battleground in the war which has killed at least 300,000 people.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Why more vegetarians don't become vegans,"The Labour leader has been a vegetarian for almost 50 years after working on a pig farm when he was in his early 20s. Speaking to staff at an outlet of cosmetics retailer Lush, the 68-year-old said: ""I eat more and more vegan food and have more and more vegan friends. ""There are quite a lot of vegan MPs - not a lot but there are some. Jeremy Corbyn talked to Lush staff as part of its Creative Showcase. ""One of my close relatives has just become a vegan and I went to her house for dinner and it was absolutely brilliant. ""So I'm going through the process alright? I won't go any further than that."" Is it safe for me to go Vegan? But like many vegetarians, his soft spot for cheese could be a potential deal-breaker. Last year he said: ""The variety of cheese in England is amazing. I like Somerset Brie, it has a nice taste to it. And Shropshire Blue, the county where I'm from. The sharper the better."" It's not just fear of missing our your favourite foods that can be an obstacle. Some who have tried veganism have found it difficult when they go out to eat. Twenty-five-year-old Sophie Howard lives in South Yorkshire and told Newsbeat it wasn't worth the hassle. ""It just became a pain. Sometimes if I wasn't able to find a vegan option I'd ask them to modify the menu and they would refuse. ""One time a chef offered to prepare a special vegan curry for me and I just felt really bad about it. I just dreaded eating out. ""I'm not a massive fan of cooking myself so it was also time consuming."" Vegans eat no dairy products, eggs or anything derived from animals. The Vegan Society told Newsbeat: ""Some people, including vegetarians, may think being vegan is difficult but as with any lifestyle change, it simply takes some time getting used to it. ""You do need to set some time aside to do research on veganism but after a few weeks it will feel as natural as anything and you will start experiencing amazing benefits. ""Perhaps it's easier for vegetarians to see that eating meat results in animal suffering and death but the dairy and egg industries are not any different - all farmed animals are slaughtered at a young age and their welfare is compromised when profit is involved.""

Larry King to end long-running US TV chat show,"Over 25 years of the show, King, famous for wearing braces, has conducted more than 40,000 interviews. Larry King Live recently made it into the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot. The news comes at a time of falling ratings for the show. King, 76, said he would spend more time with his family. His marriage to seventh wife Shawn Southwick had appeared to be on the point of breaking up earlier this year when King filed for divorce. The couple have since reconciled their differences. On his blog, King wrote that CNN had agreed to his request to wrap up the show in the autumn ""giving me more time for my wife and I to get to the kids' little league games"". He said he would ""still be a part of the CNN family"" and planned to host special programmes on major national and international events. ""With this chapter closing I'm looking forward to the future and what my next chapter will bring, but for now it's time to hang up my nightly suspenders (braces),"" he concluded. Over the course of his career, King has interviewed every US president since Gerald Ford. His most recent interviewees include Bill Gates and singer Lady Gaga. However, his show has slipped behind those of rivals such as MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Fox News's Sean Hannity in the ratings battle. The news of King's decision to end his show comes only a week after New York Times media critic David Carr suggested CNN needed to find a worthy successor for him soon. ""As it is, Mr King has been left to dangle, battered by tabloid reports, sliding ratings and his own daily battle to anchor the show five days a week,"" he wrote. ""The more legendary the talent, the more delicate the endgame."" Earlier this month, there was speculation in the press that Britain's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan was in talks with CNN to replace King. Morgan is known in the US as a panellist on America's Got Talent and hosts Life Stories in the UK, a talk show on which he has interviewed celebrities and politicians including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Commonwealth Games: Large crowds welcome Queen's Baton Relay,"The baton started its fourth day in the country with a visit to Dylan Thomas's writing shed in Laugharne, helping to mark 100 years since the poet's birth. Crowds then greeted it as it went to Ammanford, Llanelli and Carmarthen. It now heads to Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, where it will be blessed at St Davids Cathedral. A dry day helped draw people out to watch the relay on Tuesday, with baton bearers including Stella actor Julian Lewis Jones, Welsh tenor and BBC Radio Wales presenter Wynne Evans and Non Evans, the weightlifter and former Wales rugby international. In Llanelli alone police said they thought about 2,200 people had turned out. Baton bearer Kevin Evans, a triple Commonwealth medal-winning boxer from Carmarthen, said: ""It was brilliant, a really good experience - great turnout."" Entertainment and sporting activities were laid on as the relay wound its way around the county, culminating with celebrations in Carmarthen town centre on Tuesday evening. The relay is building up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow which start on 23 July. The baton's fifth day in Wales will start with a blessing on Wednesday morning in the grounds of St Davids Cathedral in Pembrokeshire by the Bishop of St Davids, the Right Reverend Wyn Evans. Baton bearers will continue the relay in Cardigan, Aberaeron and Aberystwyth, before it finishes the day in Machynlleth with sporting activities and entertainment. Jack Bradick, 11, who will carry the Queen's baton along Aberystwyth promenade, said he had been inspired to take part after the Olympic Torch Relay travelled through the town in 2012. ""I am quite excited. I have seen some very famous people who have carried it, like Tom Daley,"" said Jack, who as a Welsh Sports Ambassador for Schools encourages and motivates other children to take up sport. ""It is unusual to be part of something so big."" BATON RELAY ROUTE IN WALES •Day five: St Davids, Machynlleth •Day six: Llanberis, Beaumaris, Menai Strait, Caernarfon •Day seven: Rhyl, Moel Famau, Ruthin, Llandegla The baton arrived at Cardiff Airport on Saturday morning and was greeted in the rain by crowds in Abertillery, Ebbw Vale, Tredegar and Merthyr Tydfil. On Sunday it visited several places in Rhondda Cynon Taf, as the downpours continued before heading to Llandrindod Wells in Powys in the evening.

Putin to cut Russian imports of Western goods with new fund,"Mr Putin said in a speech that Russia would cut its dependence on energy exports and pledged to boost major domestic banks and industries. Analysts said he was trying to persuade the international community that Russia's economy could survive alone. Mr Putin also said he was optimistic about resolving the Ukraine crisis. ""Russia is trying to assert itself as an independent player,"" said Orysia Lutsevych, research fellow at Chatham House. He added that President Putin ""really wants to assert himself in the neighbourhood and he has to think about economic stability"". Investor flight Russia imports a lot of technology, especially in oil and gas exploration, and relies on access to finance in the West, she said. Russia's economy contracted in the first three months of this year. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the next quarter's figures will also show economic contraction - meaning the country is in recession. The IMF cut its 2014 growth forecast for Russia to 0.2% from 1.3% and said it expected the country's economy to grow by only 1% next year. The fund also forecast that $100bn (£59bn) would leave the country this year. Russia itself has expressed concerns about investors moving money out of the country amid tensions and sanctions over its intervention in Ukraine. Its central bank said $64bn had left the country in the first quarter of the year - more than the capital flight registered for the whole of 2013. The exit of investor money has partly been prompted by US and EU sanctions targeting a number of Russian companies and high-profile business figures, including those close to Mr Putin. 'American friends' In his speech, at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Mr Putin also accused the US of wanting to have an advantage when trading with the EU. ""Maybe our American friends - they are sophisticated guys - want to get a competitive advantage in their trade and economic relations over Europe,"" he said. The sanctions may backfire on the West, said Mr Putin. ""In the modern, interconnected world, economic sanctions as an instrument of political pressure can have a boomerang effect, and in the end they have an impact on the businesses and economies of the countries that initiated them."" The Kremlin would respect the outcome of the presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for 25 May, Mr Putin said. At least seven people were killed in fighting between rebels and Ukrainian forces outside the eastern industrial area of Donetsk on Friday, a day after the deaths of 18 soldiers in the heaviest loss for the Ukraine military since the conflict began.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Artists talk of mental health issues in music industry,"Musicians from Somerset and Bristol will share ""painful experiences"" at an event on 6 March to raise awareness. Organisations will discuss why it is ""hard to find help"" to help tackle the issue at Bristol's Trinity Centre. The talk stems from a recent survey which found 80 per cent of musicians suffer stress, anxiety and depression. Victoria Bamber, head of campaigns at Skiddle which commissioned the survey, said mental health in the music industry needed to be brought to the public's attention. A spokesman Help Musicians UK, which will be part of the panel discussion, said: ""The precarious nature of a musician's work, the connection between their art and identity and other myriad complex pressures can leave musicians vulnerable"". In response to The Prodigy singer Keith Flint's recent death, they added: ""For generations, the music industry has lost some of its brightest talent and Keith Flint's sad passing highlights the continued need for support for musicians and those working in the industry."" 'Am I good enough?' Bristol-based producer and DJ Dutchie, 23, from Devon, said: ""People making sexist comments make me feel inferior or stupid. ""Late nights and drinking, lots of travelling and time away from family and friends, the constant artistic struggle of 'am I good enough?'. ""Also, a lot of art stems from painful experiences, and although the act of music making can often be a therapy for working through these it is by no means a straightforward process"". 'I suffer badly from anxiety' Ben Osborne, 31, is a musician and composer from Bristol, currently based in Berlin. ""As a solo artist and a composer for commission, my work can often be very lonely, which can trigger some negative stuff and leave me in a position where it's hard to find help,"" he said. ""I am someone who suffers badly from anxiety, including panic attacks, as well as depression. ""Financial insecurity, undue pressure, competition, a lot of drugs and booze, a lot of loneliness, a lot of prejudices in the industry against the young, the old, against some genders, against some races - all of these contribute."" 'A volatile and competitive place' ""Extreme working hours and also the pressures of having to maintain the public image you set for yourself can contribute to mental health issues as an artist"", said 39-year-old Dr Meaker from Somerset. ""The music industry is also a very volatile and competitive place where one minute you could be doing super well and the next minute find yourself out of favour and fashion."" 'Song-writing not always a cure' Zion Flex from Bristol said her experience of the music industry ""has been largely negative"". ""Very few people cared that I struggled with depression,"" she said. ""Most people ignored me and isolated me. My race only compounded this. ""When there is nowhere else to turn we can always write our songs. Unfortunately sometimes writing a song is not a cure.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Focus on quality of early education, politicians urged","By Judith BurnsEducation reporter Politicians have concentrated on increasing the quantity of free childcare available but its quality is crucial, they say. In particular, funds should be targeted at quality provision for the poorest children, says the British Association for Early Childhood Education. They deserve more than good ""care"", says an open letter from the group. ""They need high quality, professionalised early educators,"" the letter argues. ""The evidence shows that children who benefit most from high quality early years provision are those whose families are struggling in the most challenging economic circumstances,"" says the letter. It adds that the ""substantial"" economic and social benefits of good early education ""are demonstrable for all society"". 'Emphasise quality' The group welcome the focus by politicians on the accessibility and affordability of childcare for working parents but say there needs to be more emphasis on the quality of the care and education provided. They are keen to point out this is not about the ""schoolification"" of early years. Instead they argue for a ""suitably trained workforce capable of sensitively stimulating, challenging and extending these young children's capabilities in an atmosphere which is caring, responsive and attentive to their needs"". So the next government should work both to increase the number of hours of childcare available for working parents but also on ""upskilling"" the early years workforce ""to create a graduate-led profession able to give children the best possible start in life"", they argue. The association's chief executive, Beatrice Merrick, said: ""Politicians of all parties clearly think offering more hours of free childcare will appeal to parents, but they need to look rigorously at the evidence of whether that is good use of scarce public funds. ""One clear lesson from every previous expansion of early years provision is that quality does not keep up with quality when the sector is pressured to grow too fast."" The current system entitles three and four-year-olds in England to 15 free hours of nursery or childcare a week. The Liberal Democrats say protecting funding from ""cradle to college"" is a ""red line"" issue for them while the Conservatives say they will increase the number of free hours to 30 a week, and Labour to 25 hours. Policy guide: Where the parties stand The association's president, Prof Tony Bertram, said: ""This election has seen promises to increase the number of hours of childcare for working families, and much less discussion about the quality of early education, especially for the most disadvantaged children. ""Every child has the right to the best possible start in life, including high quality care and education delivered by a well-qualified workforce. ""This may cost a little more, but all the evidence shows that it is an investment not a cost, with beneficial impacts on the educational achievement and wellbeing of our poorest children.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lothian Buses suspends evening services following attacks,"Lothian Buses, which operates hundreds of buses, said its vehicles would not run after 19:30 except its NightBus service which starts after midnight. It said it had taken the unprecedented step following months of incidents of antisocial behaviour. Police have charged 18 people in connection with the recent attacks. Lothian Buses said it would decide on Thursday if it would continue the measure. Large stones were thrown at the windows of eight moving buses in two areas of Edinburgh on Monday evening. Services were suspended following the attacks on the vehicles in Gilmerton Road and Old Dalkeith Road. And services into Clermiston were suspended for a weekend following a serious attack in Drumbrae on 5 March. The driver of the bus from the Drumbrae attack, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: ""I saw a youth coming to my side and he banged the side of the bus. ""Then I could see the rock coming towards my driver's window and it just shattered."" The driver was given an emergency appointment at the eye hospital and doctors said he had some abrasions to his cornea. He added: ""That night I couldn't sleep. I kept hearing the noises, the bang especially. ""Normally, I am a very confident person but this has wiped me out and even the thought of going on a bus is now causing me quite big problems."" Sarah Boyd, Lothian Buses operations director, said: ""It is with pride that Lothian serves at the heart of our local communities and after the challenges of the last year it's frankly appalling that the actions of a few can directly impact on so many. ""However, driver and customer safety is our absolute priority and so it is with deep regret that we have to take this action. ""We understand that we provide a critical service for key workers and those for whom travel is essential and we can only apologise to these customers who we know will be inconvenienced by this decision."" Lyn Turner, Unite regional industrial officer said: ""Our members have the right to work without fear and we stand by Lothian's decision to withdraw services from areas in which they cannot operate safely. The safety of our members is paramount. ""We would urge communities to come together and provide information on those responsible for these dangerous acts of criminal behaviour which are putting the safety of our members and that of the public at serious risk."" Lesley Macinnes, City of Edinburgh Council's transport convener, said she was ""completely behind"" Lothian Buses' decision and urged anyone with information to contact police.

Tory MSP joins calls for 'federal' UK in wake of Brexit vote,"Murdo Fraser said the EU referendum had shown up political ""disparities"" and said the ""time has come"" for ""different systems in different parts of the UK"". Labour is examining whether federalism could allow Scotland to remain part of both the EU and UK. The Scottish government has pledged to examine ""all options"" to protect Scotland's relationship with Europe. Writing for think-tank Reform Scotland, Mr Fraser called for a written constitution and the replacement of the House of Lords with a senate. In June's EU referendum, 62% of Scottish voters backed Remain, while across the UK 52% chose Leave. 'Too centralised' Voters in Northern Ireland and London also voted strongly for Remain, and Mr Fraser said this should be a ""wake-up call to governments and politicians of all parties"". He said: ""There are disparities in the way that different parts of our United Kingdom act and think politically. ""Our state is still too centralised, and we need to recognise the need for different systems in different parts of the UK. If the UK is to continue, then it must be willing to continue to devolve power to its territories. ""The answer to this problem is federalism. Its time has come."" Mr Fraser proposed a system which would see ""the existence of the Scottish Parliament entrenched in a written constitution"", with a ""de facto English parliament"" sitting in the Commons at certain times. Mr Fraser's paper comes in the wake of a speech by Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale earlier in the week, when she said that there was a ""tentative"" possibility of ""a potential federalist solution"" which could keep Scotland in the UK and the EU. Special deal She said: ""That's what the vast majority of people in Scotland want - that's been reflected in two referendum results. People in this country voted to be part of the United Kingdom and they voted to be part of the European Union."" Ms Dugdale said Labour's former justice secretary Lord Falconer was examining how this could be possible. Some experts have told MSPs that the ""simplest and most obvious way"" for Scotland to remain in the EU post-Brexit would be for it to become an independent country. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to explore all options, but said that a second independence vote was ""highly likely"" if all other avenues fail. The UK's Europe Minister, David Lidington, has cast doubt on the possibility of Scotland securing a special deal, saying there was a ""clear legal position"" that ""we have to leave the EU"" - something contested by Ms Sturgeon.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Sean Turner: 'Lost opportunities' in care, rules inquest","However, coroner Maria Voisin said Bristol Children's Hospital did not fail Sean Turner with its basic care. She recorded a narrative verdict, ruling that Sean died from a cerebral haemorrhage, thrombosis and a congenital heart defect. His parents said they now have to ""try and rebuild"" their lives. The vital corrective surgery took place six weeks before Sean, from Warminster in Wiltshire, died in March 2012. Ms Voisin said she had not heard evidence during the inquest of any ""gross failures to provide basic care"" in the treatment Sean received on Ward 32 of the hospital. She said she would not be writing a prevention of future deaths (PFD) report to the trust. During the hearing, the court was told the ward had staffing problems and did not have a high-dependency unit at the time of Sean's death. The coroner heard how Sean developed a blood clot and was given a clot-busting drug, which can cause bleeding, and it was this that caused the fatal bleed in his brain. His parents, Steve and Yolanda Turner, aged 47 and 45, told the inquest how they begged doctors and nurses to help him. They accused the nursing staff of moving Sean from intensive care too soon and said signs of his worsening condition - rising blood pressure, vomiting and fluid loss from his chest - were missed. Following the verdict, the parents' solicitor read a statement on their behalf saying: ""There were many missed opportunities to rescue Sean from his desperate situation. ""We now have to try and rebuild our lives without our little boy."" Mr and Mrs Turner said Sean's death was not isolated. Up to 10 families are believed to be taking legal action against the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust over treatment on Ward 32. Robert Woolley, chief executive of the trust, offered his ""sincere apologies"" to the family for the additional distress caused in relation to Sean's death. ""We are always improving our services and we've made significant changes since Sean was on the ward in early 2012,"" he said. ""Through medical advances we are able to treat children today who in previous decades would not have survived with the condition they were born with.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police outline security for G8 summit in Fermanagh,"By Julian FowlerBBC News They said many campaign groups were expected in Enniskillen but added that only a small number would be intent on causing trouble. School buses will operate earlier and schools will open early to help pupils avoid delays. However, flexibility will be shown on exam times if pupils are delayed. The Western Health Trust said all emergency and essential services would be maintained with extra ambulances available. GP surgeries and pharmacies will be open. The details were revealed in Lisnaskea on Wednesday at a public meeting attended by representatives from the police, NIO, Foreign Office, Western Health Trust, Fermanagh District Council and the Western Education and Library Board. Police said that, at present, there were no plans for permanent check points on the roads but these have not been ruled out. Impossible to predict However, the Lough Shore Road leading to the G8 venue at the Lough Erne Resort will close on 1 June with a pledge that it will re-open on 28 June, eight days after the summit ends. World leaders will gather at the resort on 17 and 18 June for the economic summit. Police said it was impossible to predict the number of people who would be carrying out protests during the summit. They said there would be many campaign groups coming to Enniskillen to highlight their causes before the media accompanying the G8 and a small proportion would seek to cause damage, disruption or violence. People could expect to see police in riot gear, dog handlers and Land Rovers. Water cannon would be on hand if required, as well as helicopters and boats. An unmanned aerial drone would also be available. Police have already been notified of a planned protest march from Enniskillen towards the newly-erected security fence. They said there could be a few thousand people attending the protest or 10,000 or 15,000, Numbers were still unclear. Clown wigs Police said they were aiming for the best outcome as well as planning for the worst. One group of protesters expected in Fermanagh for the summit is known as the Clown Army, whose members dress in combat gear and clown wigs. Superintendent Alan Barton said: ""They come along on occasions with colourful wigs, they come along on occasions with tickle sticks and they will engage with the local community, they will engage with the police on duty at the event. ""They will seek the publicity in order to raise the issue they are campaigning in respect of."" School buses operated by Translink and the Western Board will begin operating 30 minutes earlier in the mornings in the two weeks around the summit. Parents of pupils sitting exams during this period will receive a letter within the next few days detailing transport arrangements for them. However, they were also told there will be some flexibility around the start times of exams if pupils are delayed.

Philippines president pledges Manila bus siege inquiry,"Survivors and experts have criticised the police for being indecisive and slow in their handling of the crisis. The day-long siege ended when police marksmen shot and killed the gunman, who was a disgruntled ex-policeman. In the last hour of the siege, police failed in an attempt to board the bus. Rising anger They were forced back by gunfire from the inside of the vehicle. Almost one hour later, they managed to get on board the bus. By that time, the gunman had been killed along with eight of the 15 passengers. ""We want a thorough investigation of everything that transpired,"" Mr Aquino told a news conference. He defended the actions of the police at the scene, saying the gunman, identified as 55-year-old former senior inspector Rolando Mendoza, had not shown any sign of wanting to kill the hostages. But when asked if he was entirely satisfied with the police, he said: ""How can you be satisfied if there were some people who were killed?"" His comments came amid rising anger at the handling of the crisis. 'Visibly lacked...competence' One of the survivors, who identified herself only as Mrs Leung, told reporters: ""Why was there no one to help us after so many hours?"" She said her husband had been killed trying to stop the gunman from shooting other passengers. ""I miss him. I actually really wanted to die with him. But I think of my children,"" she said. Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang also criticised the way the siege was dealt with. And security analysts questioned whether the police were trained to handle such a situations. Frederic Gallois, who once commanded France's elite hostage rescue unit, told the AFP news agency that the police operation was ""badly prepared and risky"". Mr Gallois said the officers involved ""visibly lacked adequate equipment and tactical competence"". Earlier, police spokesman Colonel Nelson Yabut said the police had initially been forced to retreat because an officer was shot and injured. ""On our first assault, Captain Mendoza was sprawled in the middle of the aisle and shot one of our operatives. On our second assault we killed him,"" said Col Yabut. The gunman had spent almost three decades with Manila's police force, but was sacked earlier this year over claims of extortion. During the hostage crisis, he posted signs with his demands on the bus windows - the main one urging the police force to reinstate him. The gunman had boarded the bus at Luneta Park in central Manila, and the hostage drama played out across the eight-lane road inside the park. In all, 22 Hong Kong tourists were taken hostage along with three Filipinos - a driver, a guide and a photographer. Nine people were freed after initial negotiations, and the driver fled, leaving 15 hostages on board until the end of the siege.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump wiretap claims: Senator makes subpoena threat to FBI,"Senator Lindsey Graham said Congress would ""flex its muscle"" if FBI director James Comey did not meet its requests. The president has made unsubstantiated claims that his predecessor tapped his phones during the 2016 election campaign. Mr Graham also wants the FBI to confirm if there is a Trump-Russia probe. The senator, who is leading the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation of allegations of Trump-Russia ties, has said he would issue a subpoena to force Mr Comey to submit details on this and on the alleged wiretapping. Mr Comey promised on Wednesday to provide answers in a classified briefing. And he threatened to hold up Mr Trump's nominee for deputy attorney general, Rod J Rosenstein, until ""Congress is provided with the information to finally clear the air as to whether there was ever a [wiretapping] warrant issued against the Trump campaign"". The head of the House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, said on Wednesday he does not believe ""there was an actual tap of Trump Tower"". Despite repeated requests, the White House has not given any evidence for the claim, but asked Congress to examine the allegation as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in last year's election. A spokesman for Mr Obama has said the accusation is ""simply false"". No evidence of wiretapping, according to: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer backed off Mr Trump's initial claims, saying the president had broadly meant ""surveillance and other activities"", and was not accusing Mr Obama personally. The president was very specific in his accusation two weeks ago in a series of tweets, asking: ""Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president?"" Mr Graham also said he wants details about whether President Trump's campaign had any Russian ties during the presidential campaign. The South Carolina senator and Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, both members of the Judiciary Committee, asked Mr Comey to provide information on any alleged Russian connections to the Trump campaign, before 15 March. ""He hasn't answered that letter or confirmed if there's a real investigation of the Trump campaign,"" Mr Graham said on CNN's New Day programme. ""He needs to answer the letter and give the nation some information about what's going on here."" US intelligence agencies found that Russia conducted cyber-attacks against the Democratic Party as part of an effort to influence the election in Mr Trump's favour. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement. Mr Trump has been dogged by claims that his advisers and staff had ties to Russian officials, but there has been no evidence of any collusion between his campaign and Moscow.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump lawyer 'pressed Oval Office to release gold dealer',"The request reportedly prompted a swift rebuke from then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said it would constitute interference in an open investigation. Mr Giuliani reportedly asked Mr Tillerson in 2017 to help free his client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader. Mr Trump had encouraged Mr Tillerson to work with Mr Giuliani, US media said. The trader represented by Mr Giuliani, Reza Zarrab, eventually pleaded guilty in New York to orchestrating a conspiracy to launder billions of dollars in gold and cash to Iran in order to evade US sanctions. The defendant's lawyers - Mr Giuliani and former US Attorney General Michael Mukasey - reportedly proposed dropping the case against their client in exchange for an American pastor held in Turkish custody. Mr Giuliani confirmed to US media he had sought a prisoner swap. According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the Oval Office meeting, Mr Trump reportedly pressed Mr Tillerson to help prod the US Department of Justice into dropping charges against Mr Giuliani's client. ""The president says, 'Guys, give Rex your pitch,'"" a source told the Washington Post. US media said other aides present at the meeting joined Mr Tillerson in pointing out to the president that it would be inappropriate to interfere in a criminal investigation. After the meeting, Mr Tillerson emphasised to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly that such a move would be illegal. Mr Tillerson was fired by the president in March 2018. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had also personally lobbied for the trader's release, according to US media. In late 2017, after the attempted prisoner swap failed, Zarrab pleaded guilty. He testified in court that the money-laundering scheme, which involved a state-owned Turkish bank, had been approved by Mr Erdogan. Turkish officials have denied wrongdoing. Mr Giuliani is already facing intense scrutiny for his work at the White House, and his role as Mr Trump's personal lawyer. The former US attorney for New York is being investigated by his old office following the arrest of two of his associates for alleged violation of campaign finance laws, Bloomberg reported. The pair, both Trump donors, have peddled unsubstantiated corruption claims against top Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are also under scrutiny in a congressional impeachment investigation into whether Mr Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Asked on Thursday if he knew Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman, Mr Trump disavowed them. ""I don't know those gentleman,"" Mr Trump said. ""Maybe they were clients of Rudy, you'd have to ask Rudy.""

Teenagers 'want to talk about sex more with parents',"By Charlotte AshtonRevealed presenter The survey of more than 1,000 13 to 18-year-olds around the UK shows that the majority do speak to their parents about it. But more than half of 16 to 18-year-olds who have had sex say they would have been safer if their parents had given them more information about the emotional side of sex, as well as about contraception and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Forty per cent say they would have waited longer before losing their virginity. Charmaine, 17, had a baby in January and says that young people rush into sex too quickly without realising the emotional significance of it. She says she'll be more open about sex with her daughter and that she wishes her parents had spoken to her about it. ""I think if they'd have sat down and said, 'Charmaine, are you ready for sex? Do you want me to take you to the doctors? Do you want to talk about it', and I'd have said, 'Yeah', then maybe I would have thought about it a lot more."" ""[Instead] I just had unsafe sex. I didn't think about the consequences of my actions. I felt I'd be shouted at if I even spoke about it. ""If your parents sit you down and say it's special and do it properly, not so many accidents would happen. And everyone wouldn't be running around bonking basically."" Watch: Revealed - Talking about sex with your parents 'We laugh about it' The survey is part of the Sex: Worth Talking About campaign run by the Department for Children Schools and Families. Schools minister Dawn Primarolo says parents don't realise how much influence they have on their children's decisions about sex and that young people who can speak openly are more likely to delay having sex. Claudia is 16 and says talking to her mum or dad about sex isn't embarrassing. She says they talk about relationships openly, often in the context of a TV show. ""My dad and I sit and watch Skins together and it's not awkward. ""My friends are texting me like, 'I'm watching Skins with my dad, this is wrong!' But my dad and I just laugh about it. ""Things like that can trigger a conversation. It's not an actual sex talk, it'll just come into a casual conversation."" Claudia reckons her parents' open approach has made her more careful about sex. ""I know when will be the right time and when is the right time and that I can say no."" Claudia's mum, Jane, says parents who pretend their children aren't going to have sex are foolish. ""With my son, I sort of had the conversation that you have to be respectful of a girl's body. ""It was more a decency thing. And with the girls, they've never been beholden to boys. They're not desperate for boys because they've got other things going on in their life.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit worker issues 'could shut offshore platforms',"By Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland's environment correspondent The warning comes in Oil and Gas UK's latest economic report. It said delays in accessing labour markets from EU countries have the potential, in some instances, of leading to production being shut in. The UK government said employers could continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020. The report said about 5% of workers in the UK oil and gas sector come from other EU countries. That figure rises to seven percent for the offshore workforce. The report said it was ""vital that arrangements are in place between the UK and EU to allow the continued frictionless movement of people"". One example related to emergency response vessels stationed close to platforms, which require skilled engineers to operate. 'Continued volatility' The report said that if difficulties arose in recruiting replacements then platforms would have to shut down operations and production. To minimise the impact of Brexit, Oil and Gas UK said it was vital that the UK government secured frictionless access to markets and labour, maintained a strong voice in Europe for the industry, and protected the internal energy market. The 2018 Economic Report revealed that oil prices in the first half of the year were 30% higher than 2017, averaging more than $70 per barrel. Along with the continued drive to bring down costs, that was estimated to have created more than £10bn of free cash flow. But it said investors ""will continue to favour a conservative outlook"" because of the continued volatility of the oil price. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""Industry is emerging from one of the most testing downturns in its history. However, the steps that have been taken by industry, government and the regulator have delivered tangible results. ""Despite the improvements seen in recent years, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Record low drilling activity, coupled with the supply chain squeeze, threaten industry's ability to effectively service an increase in activity and maximise economic recovery. ""The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is a more attractive investment proposition - our challenge now is to take advantage of this. ""We have to drive an increase in activity while continuing to find and implement even more efficient ways of working which support the health of supply chain companies whilst also keeping costs under control."" The report said the cost of producing oil had halved since its peak and was now averaging around $15 per barrel. This has followed an industry-wide drive to bring down costs and extend the life of the UK sector. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK's economy and energy security. That's why we are providing a £2.3bn support package of measures. ""EU citizens make a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry and we've provided certainty to the industry that employers will be free to continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Plea to park safely to help guide dogs and their owners,"Guide dogs are trained to combat poor parking by guiding their owners off curb as a last resort, but it means there is a risk from passing cars.

Though she now relies on her guide dog Uri, it can still be scary to walk to the bus stop. ""It causes an enormous amount of anxiety because you don't know which way to go, or which is the best course of action,"" she said. ""I have to trust the dog. ""When I was a cane user, I was too nervous to go out. It was too scary to even go to the bus stop."" Cars parking on the pavement has meant that Sian has had to change her routes to avoid built up areas over the years. ""I do have to walk out of my way quite a lot,"" she said. ""I have been known to double back and do an extra mile. ""I once had to go back home to trace back to somewhere I knew because there was a car in the way on the pavement.

Suicide in men 'highest since 2001',"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website The Office for National Statistics data shows 19 deaths by suicide for every 100,000 men in 2013. Overall, 6,233 suicides were registered in men and women over the age of 15 in 2013 - 4% higher than the previous year. The legacy of the recession is one explanation for the rise. Overall suicide rates had been falling consistently from 15.6 deaths per 100,000 in 1981 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2007. ""Since 2007, the female rate stayed relatively constant while the male rate increased significantly,"" the ONS report states. In 2013, 78% of suicides were in men. The most vulnerable age group were those aged between 45 and 59, however, the rates have been increasing in all age groups except in the under thirties. The report added that research suggested that ""the recent recession in the UK could be an influencing factor in the increase in suicides"" and that ""areas with greater rises in unemployment had also experienced higher rises in male suicides"". 'Shocking' Marjorie Wallace, the chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, commented: ""It is really shocking that men who are or could be in their prime of life should feel driven to such a state of hopelessness and despair for the future that they are taking their own lives. ""SANE's own research shows that many suicides could be prevented, if people were able to talk more openly about their feelings and felt able to seek therapy or other help. ""Our concern is the number of suicides which are preventable and the fact that when people with mental illness hit crisis point, there are no available beds or units and they are sent home from A&E and left to suffer in silence."" Joe Ferns, from the Samaritans, said: ""The news is sadly not surprising to us given the context of a challenging economic environment and the social impact that brings.

The product is not yet on general sale but is being tested by selected people. ""Google is taking wearables seriously and it wants everyone else to,"" said John Delaney, vice-president of mobility research at analyst firm IDC. ""The industry thinks wearables is the next big thing as sales of smartphones start to plateau in developed markets and this is the latest attempt to build momentum behind it,"" he said. ""Google would be a competitor in the market but also an enabler if it helps Android developers."" Apple is reportedly working on a smartwatch that could use the operating system used on its iPhones and iPads. Android is already the most used operating system on smartphones and more than 1.1 billion devices running Android are expected to ship this year, according to the research firm Gartner. Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said it was a logical move for Google. ""From Google's perspective, it's essential it introduces some consistency into a fast-fragmenting wearables space,"" he said ""Without a consistent software development kit there was a danger that the wearables space would quickly result in a fragmented array of implementations that would make it harder for Google to control and monetise. ""Google is striving to avoid history repeating itself. The early wearables landscape is reminiscent of the tablet market when manufacturers sought to respond to Apple's iPad by using Android for larger screen devices before Google had fully optimised the platform,"" he added",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Woman hatches ducks from Waitrose eggs,"Charli Lello, 29, from Hertfordshire, put the Clarence Court eggs in an incubator as an experiment to pass the time after being furloughed. She said the ducklings would live ""a very happy life"" with her pet chickens. A Waitrose spokesman said fertilised eggs were safe to eat and ""entirely indistinguishable"" from normal eggs, unless incubated. Ms Lello, who normally works as an assistant manager in a shop, got the idea after seeing a video on Facebook of someone hatching quail eggs from a supermarket. ""While I was in Waitrose, I saw the duck eggs and thought maybe they would work as well. I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs. ""They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way."" A month after putting them in the incubator, Ms Lello heard a tiny beeping sound and the Braddock White ducklings started to emerge from their shells. You may also like: She said it had been an ""amazing"" experience hatching the ""cutest little balls of fluff"" but she would not be repeating it. ""The only reason I could try was because I am currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they won't need me all day. Under normal circumstances it wouldn't have been possible or fair on them,"" she said. A Waitrose spokesman said it was ""notoriously difficult"" to identify the sex of white-feathered ducks. ""Our farmers work hard to ensure ducks and drakes are separated correctly. As a result of this difficulty in sexing, a male white-feathered duck may very occasionally be left with a group of females, although, these instances are extremely rare. ""There may also be instances when a wild duck encounters farmed drakes, but again, this is rare,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: ""It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched. But we acknowledge that it's not impossible.""

Asian markets rally on Covid-19 vaccine hopes,"Japan's Nikkei 225 index opened more than 1.5% higher, to reach its highest level in almost 30 years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng opened 1.8% higher while in China, the Shanghai Composite, also saw gains in morning trading. Stock markets in Singapore, South Korea and Australia were also in positive territory. ""Japanese stocks are seen rallying for the sixth straight session, after the US market rocketed on news that a vaccine Pfizer and BioNTech are developing was 90% effective in protecting against Covid-19 infections,"" said a spokesman for Okasan Online Securities. ""It's big news amid worries about the virus infection spreading in Europe and in the US."" In Japan, shares in carmaker Toyota and fashion retailer Uniqlo were both up by more than 2% on Tuesday. Although gaming companies saw their shares prices head lower, with the possibility of an end to lockdowns prompting a sell-off. Nintendo was down more than 5%, while Sony slipped by as much as 2%. Global rally On Wall Street on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3%, while London's FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%. ""Preliminary trials have caused markets to come alive, not that they needed much encouragement,"" Chris Weston, Pepperstone's Melbourne-based head of research, wrote in a note. Markets were already building on gains from the election of Joe Biden as US president. Pfizer said its Covid-19 vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in preventing infection. Pfizer and BioNTech said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected a regulatory decision as soon as December. Tricky and expensive While investors are in a buoyant mood, some observers are calling for caution. ""We're far from being out of the woods, yet,"" said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). ""There will likely be bottlenecks around the actual manufacturing processes of the vaccine, and getting the jab rolled out across the world will be both tricky, and expensive,"" she added. There are also concerns as to whether the vaccine continues to work after one year, and the need for regular boosters which would add on to costs for governments. If the new vaccine is approved, the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Pfizer shares lifted as much as 11% while BioNTech shares gained 12%.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government appoints new Doncaster Council chief,"Doncaster Council was ""failing"" and incapable of making improvements, the Audit Commission said in April. Its social services department was criticised over the deaths of seven local children who had been abused. The council also apologised for failures which allowed two brothers to torture two other boys in Edlington. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the measures would turn the council around ""after 15 years of poor governance and dysfunctional politics"". 'Seriously weak' The current chief executive of Kirklees Council, Rob Vincent, will become the authority's new chief executive. A team of three commissioners will also be appointed with powers to appoint, discipline or dismiss officers. A non-executive board will be set up to monitor progress and report to the secretary of state. Mr Pickles said: ""The dysfunctional politics, poor services and ineffective leadership identified by the Audit Commission, all must be addressed. ""All parties have agreed that intervention is needed and the package of measures we're announcing today will ensure that Doncaster gets the proper leadership and expertise that is urgently required for turning this situation around."" In March 2009, the government ordered a takeover of Doncaster's children's services after the deaths of seven children in the district through abuse or neglect over five years. An independent review found childcare provision was ""seriously weak"". In January 2010, a serious case review found that the attacks in Edlington, in which two young boys were tortured by two brothers, aged 11 and 12, had been ""preventable"". The council issued an unqualified apology for ""failings which led to this terrible incident"". Then the Audit Commission report in April found the people of Doncaster were ""not well-served"" by the council. It said political rivalries were being given priority over ""much-needed improvements"" to public services. The council now have time to discuss the government's intervention proposals before a final statutory order is introduced on 23 June. 'Difficulties' ahead New chief executive Rob Vincent said: ""I am looking forward to committing myself to helping Doncaster re-find its stride and make the progress that all who know the town are looking for. ""It has had many problems over a number of years, and there will be difficulties in finding a confident way forward. ""But it is clear that many individuals, officers and politicians, remain highly committed and motivated to achieve the best for local people."" Mayor Peter Davies said in a statement: ""We note the draft directions and welcome much of what they say. ""During the three week consultation period we will continue to make representations to the government for the benefit of Doncaster."" Don Valley MP Caroline Flint said: ""The decision to bring in commissioners to help Doncaster Council get back on its feet is welcome. ""I hope Doncaster's mayor, councillors and officers will co-operate fully with the team of experts that are being bought in, in the best interests of the people of Doncaster who rely on the important services the council provides.""

Selfridges to offer clothing rental in environmental push,"Customers are demanding that businesses take environmental concerns seriously, said managing director Anne Pitcher. The company is also moving into second-hand clothes, recycling and repair, she told the BBC's Today programme. While renting clothing for weddings is an established business, doing so for regular wear is relatively new. Fashion rental companies have sprung up in China, Europe and the US in recent years. One of the first was New York-based Rent the Runway, which was set up in 2009 to lease designer clothing. Selfridges customers will soon be able to mend clothes, bags, shoes and jewellery through what the store calls a ""repairs concierge service"". Prices will depend on the repairs, it said, and can be done on items bought at the store or elsewhere. As a guide, a resewn button will cost £2 if you still have the fastener and £5 if you've lost it. A hem repair is £20. The rental part of the plan will be managed by Hurr Collective, an online clothing rental company. Outfits can be rented for 4, 8, 10 or 20 days. Customers will also be able to sell used designer wear for store credits at Resellfridges. 'No PR stunt' Selfridges is owned by the Weston family, which controls Primark through Associated British Foods. Fast fashion retailers like Primark have been criticised by MPs for encouraging a disposable attitude to clothing, although the firm insists its high street shops are better for the planet than online stores. Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee said last year that ""the government must change the system to end the throwaway society"". Asked whether fast fashion needs to change, Ms Pitcher told Today: ""I think fast fashion is a very important part of our business, but I think people are changing and what we have to do is put more value into the shopping experience."" She also insisted that her plans were not just a PR initiative, and that Selfridges has been on a ""sustainability journey"" since 2011 when it started a campaign to protect the world's oceans. She told the BBC Selfridges would ""explore new circular business models"" of rent, re-sell, repair and recycle ""making us synonymous with circularity"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nine Journalists killed since 2006 - Dinesh,"Chief whip Dinesh Gunawardhane was replying to a question raised by the opposition. ""Since January 2006, Nine journalists were killed, twenty seven were physically assaulted and five were abducted,"" said the minister. He also said that, while four of the abducted journalists were later found, investigations and judicial procedures are being carried out about the rest of the incidents. Mervin Silva ""On the 27th of December 2007, intruders broke into the national TV station the Rupavahini. According to the police, one of the employees was beaten up by the intruders. The report names Don Nuwan Gunathilaka and honourable minister Dr. Mervin Silva as the intruders. The report only name Don Nuwan Gunathilaka for assaulting the news editor of Rupavahini"". The minister explained. ""If the investigations are still going on, why did the defence secretary, in an address through state media, call murdered editor Lasantha Wickramatunge a 'rat-snake' and talk about killing 'rat-Snakes'?"" asked the leader of the opposition Ranil Wickramasingha. Dinesh Gunawardhana asked the opposition leader to present his statements with the Defence Secretary's quotes to parliament. culture of impunity and indifference Paris based Reporters Without Borders [RSF] had condemned ""The culture of impunity and indifference"" over killings and attacks on journalists in Sri Lanka. Quoting the findings of an international mission to Sri Lanka in October 2008, RSF noted three trends relating to the coverage of the conflict: ""lack of press access and independent information flow in the conflict zones, a wave of assaults and intimidation of journalists covering the conflict, and self-censorship by the media on the realities of the war."" Launching the new report, ""Media Under Fire: Press Freedom Lockdown in Sri Lanka"", the International Mission criticised the Government over its inaction and failure to take the attacks, murder and assassination of reporters seriously. Free Media Movement ""This has in turn led to an almost total blackout of independent and objective reporting from the North and East of Sri Lanka, which have seen the worst of the country's long-running civil war"". The report points out. Meanwhile the Free Media Movement had appointed an interim committee to conduct its activities until the next Annual General Meeting.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"More than 60,000 waiting to join Scouts amid 'volunteer shortage'","The organisation behind the movement said the figure had increased by 20% over the past three years. The Scout Association said it had more volunteers than ever - but many were offering less of their time and some groups had closed as a result. Some 475,000 children belong to the Scouts in different age ranges, either as Beavers, Cubs, Scouts or Explorers. More than 100,000 adults volunteer, which the Scout Association said was ""more than we have had at any point in Scouting's history"", but it also said the demand for leaders was at an all-time high. ""Our most recent census showed that we grew our volunteer membership by nearly 2,000 in a 12-month period,"" it said. ""However, with the nature of volunteering in the UK changing and more adults offering their time flexibly, more people are needed to run Scouting than ever before."" Chief Scout Bear Grylls said he was proud young people were continuing to sign up to the movement ""but to do more, we need more volunteers"". ""We still have more than 60,000 young people who want to join and gain new skills but are unable to do so,"" he said. The Scouts organisation includes groupings for four different age ranges - Beavers are aged six to eight, Cubs eight to 10, Scouts are children between 10 and 14 and the oldest group for 14 to 18-year-olds is called the Explorers. One group to have shut recently because of a lack of volunteers was the section at 1st Mobberley Beavers in Cheshire, which had been running for the past 28 years but remained closed from September following the summer break. Viv Pike, Explorer leader with Knutsford District Scouts, described it as ""a great shame"". ""Twenty little boys can now not progress from beavers to scouts to explorers,"" she said. ""There's no option for them to go to any other group - there are waiting lists all the way through."" Since 2017 waiting list figures across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have risen from 51,182 to 60,119. The South East has the biggest shortage of leaders, the Scouts Association said. Mrs Pike, who has been involved in scouting since 1981, said the situation had ""definitely got worse"" over her years as a volunteer. She said: ""I enjoy doing it, you get a great deal out of it when you see children getting their badges - I just don't understand why people won't give up their time."" The Scout Association said it was working with parents and the local community to find a team to take the Mobberley group forward.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Johnson and Corbyn poisonous, says Welsh Lib Dem MP","Jane Dodds said that was why so many MPs had defected to the Lib Dems ""because they want to be part of an open and tolerant party"". The Welsh MP was addressing her party's conference in Bournemouth. Delegates there voted to scrap Brexit if they win an early general election. Ms Dodds said she supported the move: ""If we get a majority we'll revoke [Article 50], if we don't we'll campaign very, very strongly to make sure there's a People's Vote."" When asked if her comments about Mr Corbyn meant Labour would have to change leader to get Lib Dem support in government, Ms Dodds said it would be support for another referendum that would be key. ""We'll be saying on Brexit we want a People's Vote, we will remain separate parties on all of the other issues. ""But on Brexit we're saying People's Vote and we want to see Jeremy Corbyn, if he's still leader, and Labour, support that position."" The MP has also backed calls for Wales to remain part of the UK but have its own ""meaningful"" government. She said she wanted a ""truly equal family of nations"". It comes after several Welsh independence marches, organised as the UK is set to leave the European Union. Ms Dodds won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election last month, overturning an 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes. Party members backed UK leader Jo Swinson's call to revoke Article 50 - the formal process to leave the EU - without asking the public, as the referendum has got the UK ""into a mess"". Until now, the party's policy had been to campaign for another referendum, but Ms Swinson said the party's anti-Brexit message should be ""unequivocal"" in any possible general election campaign. Analysis - BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans Wales may have voted to leave in 2016, but the Lib Dems say if they win a majority in a general election they'll cancel Brexit, if not they'll continue to campaign for remain. Why are they doubling down on a position that alienates so many Welsh voters? But this strategy is based on the assumption the general election will come before the UK leaves the EU. If the prime minister can present a deal after the Tory party conference, get agreement from EU member states at the mid-October summit and get it through Parliament the week after, he could still meet his ""do or die"" Brexit deadline. This is challenging but not impossible and would leave leave the Lib Dems looking for a new unique selling point.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ai Weiwei show at Royal Academy to house heaviest sculpture,"The 90-tonne installation, entitled Straight, is made from steel rods from buildings damaged in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. It forms part of a major retrospective of Ai's work opening at the Academy in London in September. The show is being mounted in Ai's absence, since he cannot leave China. Following the Sichuan quake, Ai collected some 200 tonnes of twisted steel rods destined for recycling. They were straightened by hand in his studio in Beijing and returned to the form they would have been in before they were bent by the earthquake. The resulting artwork is described by the RA as ""a sober monument to the victims of the earthquake"". In a statement, Ai said he was ""honoured"" to have the chance to exhibit at the Royal Academy. ""I'm very happy to be a part of it. This exhibition is my first major survey in London, a city I greatly admire. The selected artworks reflect my practice in recent years, and also include new works made specifically for this show."" Among those new pieces is Remains (2015) - a porcelain work that replicates a group of bones excavated at the site of a labour camp that operated under Communist leader Mao Zedong in the 1950s. Adrian Locke, co-curator of the exhibition said: ""Working with Ai Weiwei has presented us with new challenges but his ability to comprehend space, even without having experienced it first-hand, and the clarity of his vision for the use of that space in relation to his work has been revelatory."" The RA said exhibition was developed in close collaboration with Ai, who ""virtually navigated the spaces"" from his studio in Beijing. Ai used a similar method when he helped but together an exhibition of his work at Blenheim Palace last year. The artist has not been able to leave China since his passport was confiscated four years ago. An outspoken critic of the Chinese government, Ai was detained for almost three months without charge in 2011. After he was released, he was accused of tax evasion and fined 15m yuan ($2.4m, £1.5m). As part of his bail conditions, the Chinese authorities imposed a foreign travel ban on the artist. Ai Weiwei at the Royal Academy runs from 19 September - 13 December 2015.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Two Door Cinema Club's Lady Gaga remix 'total surprise',"Interview by Greg Cochrane, words by Steven McIntoshNewsbeat reporters The band's reworking of the US singer's Electric Chapel appeared on her remix album earlier this year. Alex Trimble from the band described the experience as an ""incredible opportunity"". Two Door Cinema Club, from County Down, have had chart success in the UK with I Can Talk, What You Know and Something Good Can Work. Trimble said: ""I got a call from our manager, saying Lady Gaga's asked if you want to do a remix and you've got a week to do it in. ""For me that's not really a lot of time, especially as we were on tour, but I couldn't really turn down that chance. It's such an incredible opportunity. ""So I just worked every single day and night and just threw it together and I'm really proud of it. It's such an honour to be asked by such a massive artist."" 'Writing solidly' Two Door Cinema Club are working on their second album. ""It's coming along pretty well, we've been writing solidly since the start of October,"" said Trimble. ""I'd say we're probably 70% there with the writing, so hopefully by the end of January we'll be ready to hit the studio and start recording."" The band are living together while they work on the new album. ""We've set up a little rehearsal space in our basement and a studio in one of the spare bedrooms, so we've got a nice little comfortable set-up here,"" Trimble said. ""It's very helpful when we're trying to write and we can do it at any time of day. We live in a nice detached house so there's no real problem with bothering the neighbours or anything so we can usually make as much noise as we like."" The 22-year-old is the band's lead singer and also plays guitar. ""Usually we'll write all afternoon, and then we'll do our own thing in the evening. It's nice that we've got a schedule so we've got a bit of time to ourselves if we need it,"" he added. The band released their debut album Tourist History in March 2010. ""The first record was written when we were still at school. There wasn't a lot of life experience in that album,"" the singer said. ""This time we've toured the world three or four times over and met so many interesting and wonderful characters, and visited beautiful and amazing places.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New evidence could solve 1990 Oxfordshire taxi murder,"By Michael RaceBBC News Lennie Gomm, 75, was stabbed directly through his heart in Hampton Gay Lane, near Bletchingdon, after he had picked up a fare on 13 June 1990. The motive for his killing remains unclear and the case's prime suspect, the passenger, remains undetected. Officers said the new evidence could ""link a suspect to the scene"". Peter Beirne, head of Thames Valley Police's major crime investigation review team, said ""advancements in forensic science"" had allowed fresh evidence to be gathered from Mr Gomm's taxi and clothing. He appealed for members of the public with ""information or suspicions"" about the attack to contact officers, who he said would be able to track down and investigate new suspects in the cold case. ""You might know someone who acts strangely when Lennie's murder is mentioned... or perhaps you know someone who has an obsession with the case,"" Mr Beirne said. Detectives hope that over the past three decades the killer has ""confided in somebody"" who may now be able to come forward. Although there is no certainty over the motive for Mr Gomm's stabbing, Mr Beirne said the attack was ""probably"" as a result of ""an argument that escalated"". The body of father-of-three Mr Gomm, from Forest Hill near Wheatley, was found by a truck driver at 10:50 BST on 13 June 1990, close to his blue Ford Granada. He had picked up a man, thought to have long hair, in Banbury Road in Oxford at about 06:30 and told the ABC Taxi control room he was heading to Bicester. The last sighting of his taxi was at 07:00 and evidence suggests Mr Gomm and the passenger ""were in heated discussions as though they were arguing as to where to go"" near the Bletchingdon area. Post-mortem examinations established Mr Gomm died from a stab wound to the chest that passed through his heart, though he had a second minor wound to the left of his chest and marks around his mouth. Police said he had not been robbed and no murder weapon has been found. Several arrests were made during the initial investigation but no charges were brought. Mr Gomm's daughters urged anyone with information to contact the police ""so that we can hopefully find the person responsible for ending our father's life so brutally"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pinewood marks first year in Wales,"Pinewood Shepperton has spent the last few months moving into the 180,000 sq ft complex at Wentloog. First Minister Carwyn Jones will visit the studio with his government stressing the importance of creative industries to the economy. Work on one of Pinewood's first major productions is also about to start. The Bastard Executioner is an historical drama for the US cable channel FX. It tells the story of a 14th Century knight turned executioner during the reign of Edward III, set against a background of Welsh rebellion. The mini-series is written by Kurt Sutter, who created Sons Of Anarchy. A £30m funding pot has been set up by the Welsh Government to support film and TV drama shot in Wales over the next five years. Ministers hope it will generate £90m for the economy. The first to benefit is Take Down, a thriller being produced at Pinewood, directed by Jim Gillespie, behind I Know What You Did Last Summer. Pinewood, based in Buckinghamshire since the mid 1930s, is a studio name behind more than 2,000 films and 600 television productions with big names ranging from James Bond, Star Wars to the Carry On comedy series. The studio is starting to provide a home for local businesses offering services ranging from special effects to specialist vehicle hire. Hannah Thomas, head of creative sector development for the agency Ffilm Cymru, which supports the industry, said of Pinewood's opening on the outskirts of Cardiff: ""It's hugely exciting, it's great for the industry in general. 'Futuristic' ""Anything that can build capacity and create more jobs for Welsh people and give people the opportunity to work in film and television is welcome."" She said they were in regular contact with Pinewood about talent information. ""It's a globally recognised brand, it's exciting and has access to infrastructure and facilities companies that can only strengthen the industry - it's a positive for everyone."" Film producer John Giwa-Amu of Red and Black Films - behind sci-fi thriller The Machine and Little White Lies - said: ""We have a big slate of about 10 projects coming forward, of various budgets, some quite large. ""We do sci-fi so there are a lot of sets built, a lot futuristic stuff, so to have somewhere with the capacity of Pinewood and to know we can stay in Wales with the support of the wonderful crew is brilliant."" The visit comes days after it emerged that officials had turned down a request for part of the new James Bond film to be shot inside the Welsh assembly's debating chamber.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brittan widow attacks Met over abuse claims handling,"Lord Brittan died in January 2015, after being falsely accused of sexual abuse, and Lady Brittan's homes were searched while she was still grieving. No police officer has been disciplined for the way the case was conducted. Lady Brittan told the Daily Mail that public bodies had to show a ""strong moral compass"". From 2014, her husband, who had been home secretary from 1983 to 1985, was caught up in a Met investigation - Operation Midland - into false claims of sexual abuse in Westminster. The Brittans' homes in London and North Yorkshire were later raided, along with those of former armed forces chief Lord Bramall and former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor. It later emerged that all the claims were based on lies by fantasist Carl Beech, who has since been jailed for perverting the course of justice, but Lord Brittan died before that was established. An independent review of the case by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques criticised the Metropolitan Police, but the Independent Office for Police Conduct found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by officers. Lady Brittan told the Daily Mail: ""In the end, it's the leadership of any police force: that's where the buck stops. ""But I think a lot of this comes down to culture. And one of the things that interests me is, as an outcome, is the police appear to have a culture which is cover up and flick away."" Lady Brittan also accused Tom Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party, of doing an ""awful and terrible thing"" in writing a newspaper column highlighting the claims made by Beech, published three days after her husband's death. She called this ""about the most despicable thing I think a human being could do to another"". Mr Watson has previously said he felt ""very, very sorry"" about the way events turned out, adding: ""I genuinely feel very deeply for the people who have had injustices done to them as a result of the failed police inquires - I really do."" Following Sir Richard Henriques, the Met apologised for its handling of the case and later paid compensation to Lord Brittan's family. In March last year, Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said: ""Operation Midland had a terrible impact on those who were falsely accused by Carl Beech. ""The previous commissioner and I have apologised to them and I repeat that apology again today."" The BBC has approached the Met for a response to Lady Brittan's comments.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
CWU says Royal Mail workers 'certain' to back strike,"Billy Hayes told The Andrew Marr Show that he was ""absolutely confident"" of a yes vote. The union is unhappy about privatisation plans, as well as a current pay offer. The outcome of the ballot will be announced on 3 October, with strikes possible seven days after that. The current proposal from Royal Mail gives staff a pay increase of 8.6% over three years. This is the first nationwide strike ballot for Royal Mail workers since 2009. Privatisation plans After the ballot was announced, Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene, said that she still hoped to reach an agreement with the union. ""Talk of a ballot for industrial action makes no sense when there is a significant three-year deal on the table and negotiations are ongoing,"" she said. While Mr Hayes argued Royal Mail did need investment, and faced increased competition for parcel deliveries from the likes of TNT, he insisted that privatisation was not the best option. ""Privatisation will damage our postal service,"" he said. He added that in terms of support from the union for a strike, and his opposition to privatisation, he was ""very confident in our position."" Moratorium? Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond on Sunday called for a moratorium on the privatisation of Royal Mail until after the independence referendum. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""I want a moratorium on the sell off of the Royal Mail to allow the people of Scotland, when they vote next year, to come to a decision on whether that national asset should stay in public hands or be hived off as the London government intend to do at the present moment."" The government last week gave formal notice to the stock exchange of plans to privatise the Royal Mail ""in the coming weeks"". Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme said that Labour will not pledge to renationalise the Royal Mail. Any such move would be ""completely irresponsible"" and ""like writing a blank cheque"" he said. Under the privatisation plans, Royal Mail staff will get 10% of the shares. The public and institutional investors will be able to purchase the rest. The minimum amount members of the public can buy in shares will be £750. Free shares will be given to 150,000 UK-based Royal Mail employees, who will be able to apply for additional shares under an employee priority offer, with a minimum application of £500. BBC business editor Robert Peston said he expected the sale to take place in November.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London Stock Exchange resumes trading after glitch,"The bourse stopped automated trading for over four hours until 1215 GMT to investigate a ""market data"" issue. The problem had been identified during Friday's opening auction, which is used to determine the day's starting prices on the exchange. Stocks rose strongly when it reopened, catching up with European markets. The FTSE 100 index ended the day 81 points, or 1.4%, higher at 6,001. The rebound came despite downwardly revised UK economic growth data being released during the morning outage. Investors were instead responding to growing confidence that Saudi Arabia would step in to secure global oil supplies, although many were left frustrated that they missed out on the brisk morning trading seen on other European indexes. ""We sincerely regret the inconvenience that today's disruption to trading has caused our customers,"" said LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet. The exchange decided not to extend its trading hours to make up for the lost trading time. 'Not foolproof' An LSE spokesperson added that orders-driven securities trading - which comprises the bulk of trading on the exchange - had resumed. Quote-driven trading continued throughout the day but this form of trading is very small in comparison with orders-driven trading. The exchange earlier noted in a statement on its website that it had ""moved its main market trading to the MillenniumIT system earlier this month"", but did not specify whether this lay behind the error. Trading on the Borsa Italiana - which is owned by the LSE - was halted for three and a half hours on Tuesday, also because of a computer error. According to the exchange, that incident was unrelated to Friday's London suspension, and the two exchanges use different technology platforms. ""In this day and age, you simply cannot afford not to have your technology in duplication,"" said David Buik of brokerage BGC Partners, speaking on Bloomberg television, criticising the exchange's apparent lack of a back-up system. ""If it's not foolproof, where is the alternative?"" he said.

Covid-19: Ministers urged to ban 'reckless' evictions over rent arrears,"By Sinead WilsonBBC News A group of MPs are calling for ""urgent"" action to prevent a new surge in homelessness in the coming weeks. They say thousands of renters with six months of debts risk ending up on the streets - despite a £180m support fund. Ministers have extended a ban on evictions several times - the current one is due to run out on 31 March. The devolved governments in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have also taken action to prevent evictions. A group of Labour, Green and Lib Dem MPs and three peers have written to Mr Jenrick to urge him to do more to protect people who have got into debt through no fault of their own. 'Financial insecurity' They say the housing secretary watered down protections by no longer excluding debts accrued since the coronavirus crisis began, when he extended the eviction ban in February. Previously, landlords were able to evict tenants for exceptional reasons only such as anti-social behaviour or extreme levels of debt. The MPs are calling for protection in law for people who have built up six months of arrears during the pandemic because of lost income and now face being made homeless. Labour MP Stephen Timms who's leading the campaign, says the ""widespread financial insecurity"" of renters across the country means many face ""an immediate and direct risk of homelessness"". Among the measures his group is calling for are: Half a million private tenants in the UK are behind with their rent, according to research by Citizens Advice. Budget measures? The average amount owed is more than £700, the charity says, and one-in-four private renters in arrears have been threatened with eviction or cancellation of contract by their landlord. There is speculation Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce measures in Wednesday's Budget to provide further grants and loans to help clear rent arrears. But some campaigners say this will trap tenants in a spiral of debt. Groups such as the London Renters Union say debts should be cleared and landlords prevented from taking the cash and evicting tenants anyway. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said while the eviction ban has ""bought many worried renters a few more weeks in their home"" it does not not solve the ""looming crisis"". ""Shelter's services are inundated with calls from people and families, frightened about losing their homes. Many are forced to choose between eating and paying rent - the devastating impact of a pandemic that nobody asked for,"" she said. ""Without action, this rent debt crisis could lead to rising homelessness. The government must give renters emergency grants to pay off 'Covid arrears', and stay safe in their homes."" The UK government says it has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, and that measures have struck ""the right balance between protecting tenants and enabling landlords to exercise their right to justice"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Israel 'thwarts Hezbollah infiltration from Lebanon',"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said up to four militants crossed the border in the Mount Dov area, part of the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights. A Hezbollah statement said it had not engaged in any clashes, instead blaming a ""nervous"" enemy. The area has been tense for days after the death of a Hezbollah fighter. He was killed in an alleged Israeli air strike in Syria. Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied it carried out the strike in the early hours of last Monday, had warned Hezbollah not to retaliate. The IDF said ""the terrorists fled back to Lebanon"" after being shot at on Monday. Mr Netanyahu, in a televised address, said he took a ""grave view of this attempt to infiltrate our territory"". He added: ""Hezbollah and Lebanon bear full responsibility for this incident and any attack from Lebanese territory against Israel. Hezbollah should know that it is playing with fire."" Israeli media, citing unnamed military sources, said the Hezbollah cell was planning to attack an IDF post. The reports said Israel had been tracking them and its forces opened fire once the militants crossed the so-called Blue Line - the UN-recognised boundary between Israel and Lebanon. Reports say the Israeli army fired artillery shells in their wake. There are no reports of casualties on the Lebanese side. Hezbollah, which is heavily armed and funded by Israel's arch-foe Iran, is the most powerful armed force in Lebanon alongside the Lebanese army. It operates predominantly in the south of the country and along with its political allies is an influential force in the government. The Hezbollah statement said its fighters had not been involved in any clash, shooting or infiltration on Monday, saying ""it was only one party, which was the fearful, anxious and tense enemy"". However, the statement warned that a response to the death of its fighter was ""definitely coming"". Israel and Hezbollah are bitter enemies who fought a month-long war in 2006 after Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and abducted two in a cross-border raid. The ensuing conflict killed some 1,191 people - mostly civilians - in Lebanon, and 121 soldiers and 44 civilians in Israel. A flare-up has been in the offing for days now along one of the region's most combustible frontiers. Exactly what these militants had in mind when they crossed a few metres from Lebanon into Israeli-controlled territory isn't clear. They were armed with assault rifles and planning an attack, says Israel. So far there are conflicting reports in Lebanon as to whether this was the Hezbollah revenge for the death of one its fighters last week. The group itself is playing the entire incident down and saying retaliation will still come. It is far from certain this current ""round"" of fighting is over. And the bitter enmity between the two sides will go on: Israel seeks to emasculate Hezbollah's Iran-backed plans for a new arsenal of high-tech rockets, while the Lebanese group derives its core support from showing strength against Israel.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Apple Irish tax case appeal heard by EU court,"In 2016, the European Commission found an agreement between Dublin and the technology giant was against EU law. It said the Irish government allowed Apple to attribute nearly all its EU sales earnings to an Irish head office that existed only on paper, thereby avoiding paying tax on EU revenues. Both the Republic of Ireland and Apple are appealing against the ruling. Analysis: Message to business important for Ireland By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics and Business Editor Why would any government want to turn down a €14bn tax windfall? For Ireland, the motivation is twofold: First there is the desire to disprove claims that it acts, or has acted, as a tax haven. The country has faced increasing criticism of its corporate tax policies, with the American economist Gabriel Zucman leading the charge. He has accused Ireland of being ""the world's number one tax haven"". Secondly, Ireland wants to demonstrate to multinational investors that the country is a safe and predictable place to do business. Apple's lawyer Daniel Beard told the court the order issued by the European Commission three years ago ""defied reality and common sense"". ""The activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple's profits outside the Americas"", he added. The European Commission argued Ireland allowed Apple to reduce substantially its tax bill in a way that gave the technology giant a selective advantage over other companies located in Ireland, said Laura Treacy, a Brussels-based partner at Irish law firm McCann FitzGerald. ""The two companies in question were really the revenue generating companies for all of Europe. They happened to be located in Ireland,"" Ms Treacy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""They were established in Ireland, but importantly, they were non-tax resident in Ireland and, as a result, they were not required to pay income or corporate tax on their worldwide profits but rather only on the profits that were attributable to the Irish operations."" The Irish state argues the EC has misunderstood the Irish tax rules and Irish tax arrangements, she said. ""Where the commission says a lot of the profits were being transferred to head offices which, according to the commission, had no employees and no staff, and carried on very little substance,"" she said. ""Ireland and Apple are saying no actually, quite serious decision making was taking place in these head office entities,"" she added. ""And it was correct to allocate the vast proportions of the profits to the head offices, leaving only smaller amounts in Ireland because they are saying only routine tax decisions were taking place in Ireland."" Ms Treacy said both Apple and Ireland argue that one of the commission's key points is incorrect and does not form part of state aid law, but is instead ""a kind of novel rule"" introduced by the commission.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greater Manchester PC Nicola Hughes' cortege met by applause,"By Katie CookseyBBC News Some threw flowers at the hearse on Deansgate as police officers in full ceremonial dress silently bowed their heads in honour of their colleague. Inside the hearse, a police hat could be seen on top of the coffin of the 23-year-old, whose family said she died doing the job she loved. PC Hughes was one of two officers shot dead on 18 September after answering what appeared to be a routine burglary call in Mottram. Greater Manchester Police Federation chairman Ian Hanson had urged people to stand shoulder to shoulder with police at the funeral and the thousands that lined the route did just that. Crowds had started to gather along the Deansgate funeral procession route from 11:00 BST when the road was closed. Silence descended on the normally bustling shopping street as people waited - some comforting each other, others quietly reflecting. Shops emptied and builders stopped work to line up on scaffolding overlooking the road. Det Con Ian Parker, of the Merseyside force, said officers had been touched by the public's reaction. ""On the train from Liverpool this morning people shook my hand and said they were thinking of us. ""Some people were also on their way to the funeral, it was quite touching - people have been very respectful."" Two officers from every other force in the country had answered an appeal to help line the route so that GMP colleagues could attend the funeral. Mounted police led the procession, which was accompanied by police outriders on motorbikes and followed by officers walking. Hundreds of other officers had travelled from across the country on their days off to attend. Susan McElroy stood behind her uniformed husband, Greater Manchester PC Henry McElroy, wearing one of the wristbands produced in honour of the two officers who died. She said: ""It so easily could have been me losing a husband, any one of the people here, it could have been them. ""It's an amazing tribute to see so many turning up. ""The wristbands are so we remember their collar numbers - usually when officers leave the force their collar numbers are re-used, but these won't be."" Other people had turned out to show their support and their anger at what had happened. Pensioner Kathleen Bowen, of Denton, said: ""I wanted to come to respect them because of the job they do. ""Our neighbours have a son in the police and it could have happened to them. ""They were only doing their job, they didn't deserve it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Saga shares close flat on debut,"The shares were priced at 185 pence, at the bottom of the 185-245p range announced earlier this month, and traded as high as 195p in conditional trading. Almost 300 million shares were issued, representing 27% of the overall value of the business. At the offer price, the company was valued at £2.1bn. Saga is one of many companies listing on the stock market this year. Investor fatigue? Earlier on Friday, Easyhotel became the latest company to announce plans to float its shares, and this followed a raft of flotation announcements on Thursday - including property website Zoopla, airline Wizz Air and discount retailer B&M. Already this year, companies such as Poundland, Pets at Home, AO World and the owner of Patisserie Valerie have floated on the London market. ""The key difference to last year is that IPOs [initial public offerings] are being priced at the lower end of their ranges due to concerns over market valuations,"" said James Butterfill, global equity strategist at bankers Coutts. However, there have been signs that appetite among investors for some of these flotations might be beginning to wane. On Thursday, Fat Face abandoned its flotation plans blaming current market conditions. Also Saga's shares were priced at the bottom of its indicated range, although the company said earlier this week it had seen ""exceptional"" demand from retail investors. ""Amid the UK IPO fever, concerns have emerged that investors may be suffering from flotation fatigue,"" said Mr Butterfill. Customer demand Saga is set to raise about £550m through the flotation. Half of the shares on offer are going to retail investors, with a ""substantial majority"" of these going to its customers. The company said that applications for the minimum amount of £1,000 of shares would be met in full, and more than two-thirds of retail investors had been granted at least 50% of the shares they had applied for. Saga's executive chairman Andrew Goodsell said: ""We have been very pleased with the level of demand for Saga shares from both retail and institutional investors, with the offer subscribed several times over."" ""We are delighted to have so many of our customers as shareholders and to have a high quality group of core institutions who we believe will be long-term supporters of the business.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Alex Salmond hails green energy work by Scots and Norwegians,"Alex Salmond highlighted the renewables links between the two countries during a visit to Norway. Work is under way to link hydro power from Norway with wind energy from Scotland. The Scotland-Norway interconnector, which received a European Union grant of about £553,00 in March, aims to achieve this. Scottish and Southern energy, along with three Norwegian energy companies and Swedish utility firm Vattenfall are all involved in the NorthConnect scheme. The Scottish European Green Energy Centre has also contributed a grant of about £40,000 to support early survey work. In addition, a cable route study is now under way along with environmental studies in both the UK and Norway. Mr Salmond welcomed the progress and also announced the launch of an online ""hydro heritage"" project involving Historic Scotland and Norwegian partners, which aims to log the development of the hydro industry. Both Scotland and Norway are ""blessed with a wealth of natural resources"", Mr Salmond said, and that the development of hydro-power technology between the two countries had ""many parallels"". He said: ""Building on our hydro heritage and offshore energy engineering expertise gained from North Sea oil and gas, our nations are clearly both well placed to make a huge contribution to Europe's green energy ambitions. ""From world-leading offshore wind, marine and hydro energy in the north of Europe to massive solar power in the south, we have huge natural renewable resources, which must be harnessed in the most efficient way to deliver benefits for all the continent's citizens. ""The NorthConnect project is an excellent example of the kind of grid interconnection that will be needed across the continent to ensure we maximise the contribution of all European nations to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, increase energy security and meet targets for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy generation."" NorthConnect chairman Odd Øygarden welcomed the Scottish government's support for the project. He predicted a future with ""huge levels of wind-based generation of electricity in the UK and the North Sea"", and said: ""NorthConnect connecting the Nordic hydro-based electricity production with this wind generation will create a unique renewable quality in security of supply in the European electricity market.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Razzies: Christian comedy film gets top golden raspberry,"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, Los Angeles Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas won four awards, including worst picture and worst actor, at Saturday night's 35th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony. The tongue-in-cheek show, which celebrates movie-making mediocrity, took place a short walk from the venue for Sunday's Academy Awards. Razzie winners, who rarely turn up, get a $4.79 gold-spray-painted trophy. Vanity project Saving Christmas won worst picture, worst actor, worst screenplay and worst screen combo - for former Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron ""and his ego"". ""This is a vanity project that Kirk Cameron put together,"" Razzie founder John Wilson told BBC Radio 5 live after the ceremony. ""It's about on the level of a super 8 movie from when I was a kid. It has no cinematic value at all."" He pointed out that the film was rated number one worst movie of all time on international movie database IMDB.com Saving Christmas is also only one of two films last year to score a zero rating on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. The tag line on its film poster is ""Put Christ back in Christmas"". Cameron Diaz was named worst actress for two comedies The Other Woman and Sex Tape. The worst supporting actress prize went to Megan Fox for the reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction had led the field with seven nominations, but won only worst director and worst supporting actor for Kelsey Grammer. Annie was named the worst remake, rip-off or sequel. A new category - the Razzie Redeemer award - was introduced this year to reward a former Razzies target who has done good work in the past 12 months.

London tower block 'mouldy and damp' after cladding removed,"One woman who complained to the council of mould in her daughter's bedroom, said she was given a hat, gloves and blankets to keep warm. Kensington and Chelsea council removed the insulation from Adair and Hazlewood towers in west London in November 2018. It said it was putting together a compensation package for occupants. The removal of the cladding and polystyrene insulation was prompted by the deaths of 72 people in a fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017. A report - following the first phase of the public inquiry into the Grenfell fire - found in October last year that the tower block's cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the ""principal"" reason for the fire's rapid and ""profoundly shocking"" spread. Sue Duggings, who lives on the seventh floor of Hazlewood Tower in Golborne Gardens, said the replacement insulation was taking too long to fit. She said residents were told they would not incur extra heating costs and although the council upgraded the heating system to be on constantly, many radiators were broken. ""So a lot of people are getting electric heaters to keep themselves warm but of course that's upping their electricity bills,"" she added. Fatima Bourenane said she was given gloves and hats by the council after seeking help with mould in her third-floor flat. ""It's just cold, freezing, muddy with the water. I have to use my own heaters and the bill is very high,"" she said. Another resident, Richard Cracknel, added: ""The block is acting like a sponge because when it rains the walls are absorbing the water into the walls and into the flat. ""They have treated my walls but the water is still falling in pools on the kitchen floor."" Deputy council leader Kim Taylor-Smith agreed the replacement ""was a taking longer than originally envisaged"". He added the work would be carried out in July, after further consultation with residents. ""In the meantime we will continue to support them and we will compensate people for the disruption,"" he said. The second phase of the independent inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will take place on 27 January.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US finds against Bombardier in Boeing dispute,"The US Commerce Department investigated the aerospace firm's US sales after a petition from rival American company Boeing. The conflict has the potential to lead to job losses in Northern Ireland. Bombardier said it was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision. The dispute has contributed to escalating trade tensions between the US and Canada. The fight stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada. Bombardier employs about 1,000 people in Belfast linked to the C-Series. The Unite union in the UK called the Commerce Department decision ""nakedly political"", adding it had the potential to ""crush jobs, not only in Northern Ireland but in the US too"". ""More than 50 percent of C-Series components are sourced from the US, where the supply chain sustains 22,000 US jobs. The economic impact of these tariffs would be felt in communities on both sides of the Atlantic,"" said Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner. ""Boeing is using its meritless complaint as cover to close the US market, which is one of the biggest in the world, to new entrants such as Bombardier's C-Series aircraft."" The Commerce Department's final determination on Wednesday set trade duties of about 292% - slightly lower than a preliminary finding. The inquiry now moves to the US International Trade Commission, which will examine if the dumping and subsidies caused injury to Boeing. It is expected to make a final decision in February 2018, which would trigger the duties. This week, Canada's ambassador to the US warned that it might take the fight to the World Trade Organization, if the US continues to side with Boeing. Earlier this month Canada scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Canada's anger over the trade challenge. On Wednesday, Bombardier said the Commerce Department had not taken into account Bombardier's plan to build a facility in the US, as part of a planned partnership with Airbus. ""This facility will provide US airlines with a US-built plane thereby eliminating any possibility of harm due to imports,"" said spokesman Mike Nadolski. ""Unfortunately, the Commerce Department decision is divorced from this reality and ignores long-standing business practices in the aerospace industry, including launch pricing and the financing of multibillion dollar aircraft programs."" The Commerce Department said it will collect the duties from the importer, if the US commission finds against Bombardier. Delta has said it plans to move forward with the order, but does not expect to pay the tariffs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust failed to act on 258 recommendations,"By Nic RigbyBBC News The report to Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation's Trust's board said there was a ""risk"" in having outstanding recommendations. Former Norfolk coroner William Armstrong said the trust's failure to act was a ""serious concern"". The trust said staff were receiving additional training. Serious incident reviews take place after there are unexpected or avoidable deaths or severe harm to a patients, or allegations of abuse. Last week the trust became the first of its kind in England to be put in special measures. The report to its board said recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) reports on the trust said ""learning at all levels of the organisation is not taking place"". Mr Armstrong, who is also chairman of watchdog Healthwatch Norfolk, said as Norfolk coroner he had seen a number of cases of deaths of mental health patients where serious incident inquiries had been conducted by the trust. ""It would be a serious concern if recommendations in a report make a commitment to learn lessons to reduce risks... and they are not implemented,"" he said. Some of the recommendations from the reviews date back to 2012. Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns at Mind, said: ""Serious incident reviews are an essential part of the process of understanding how incidents including deaths, severe harm and abuse have occurred and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent them. ""Any recommendations that come out of them have to be taken seriously and implemented swiftly to ensure that healthcare providers learn from past mistakes."" Emma Corlett, who represents Unison members at the trust, said: ""It is a surprise to see that level of recommendations still to be implemented. Our staff will be really concerned about that."" A spokesman for the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk and Suffolk said: ""It is deeply shocking and insulting to patients and their families that the trust has failed to implement 258 recommendations, despite repeatedly promising 'lessons will be learnt'."" Jane Sayer, director of nursing at the trust, said that while some recommendations could be put in place immediately, ""others will take a while to roll out"". She said: ""Four hundred and fifty improvement actions, resulting from serious incident reviews recommendations, have been carried out in the past year alone. ""We are not complacent about this issue... and we now offer additional training and support to frontline staff to encourage them to not only implement the actions but to fully report back.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tory MSPs urge UK government to let asylum seekers work,"At present, asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work while waiting for their applications to be decided. MSPs called on ministers to relax the rules and allow them to take jobs. Tory member Michelle Ballantyne said she had written to the home secretary arguing that those seeking refuge should have the opportunity to make a ""meaningful contribution"". The UK government has said it is ""listening carefully"" to the ""complex arguments"" on the subject. Under present rules, asylum seekers are only allowed to work if they have waited more than a year for a decision on their application, and are able to fill a role on the official ""shortage occupation"" list. MSPs were debating a motion which called for changes to asylum policy to create a ""long term sustainable solution that does not leave people destitute or homeless at the end of the asylum process"". The Scottish Conservatives said they had appealed to the Conservative-run UK government to relax rules to let asylum seekers work. Ms Ballantyne told MSPs: ""During the time that it takes to go through the process of seeking asylum, which can be years, we need to ensure that we don't put people's lives on hold, and we don't waste the skills that people have, or prevent them from developing as people. ""If we don't ensure that asylum seekers have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to their own lives, as well as their host nation, we do everyone a disservice. ""While I appreciate that asylum seekers can currently engage in voluntary work, if we really want to ensure that individuals are able to prosper both here, and should they ever wish to return to their countries, the prospect of employment is essential."" The move was welcomed by MSPs from other parties, who were critical of the UK's asylum policy during the Holyrood debate. Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the Scottish government's key principle was one of ""integration from day one"". She said: ""This means that people should be welcomed and supported to integrate from day one, not just when refugee status and leave to remain have been granted. ""People seeking asylum have to navigate a complex and often frustrating system sometimes over many years before they receive refugee status and are able to get on with their lives. ""That is often at great cost to their mental health and future prospects."" 'Complex arguments' In a debate at Westminster in October, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said she was ""listening carefully to the complex arguments about permitting asylum seekers to work"". She said there was a ""balance to be struck"", and that current policy ""seeks to protect the resident labour market and ensure that any employment meets our needs for skilled labour"". But she said there was ""much merit"" in the argument that asylum seekers should be allowed to work, saying she was ""receptive to the views and evidence presented to me on the right to work"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Domestic abuse law: 'No excuse' for Northern Ireland delays,"By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI home affairs correspondent Police figures show one incident being reported every 17 minutes. The chief inspector of criminal justice said there were ""frustrations"" that new legislation is on hold without a functioning assembly. Brendan McGuigan added that other ""key initiatives"", suggested nine years ago, have not been acted upon. Kelly Andrews, of Belfast and Lisburn Women's Aid, said families were ""living in terror"" while Northern Ireland's domestic abuse legislation lagged behind the rest of the UK and Ireland. Mr McGuigan's report noted there had been a focus on the issue in early 2017, before Stormont collapsed, with legislation discussed to create a new offence of domestic abuse. ""Without a functioning assembly, or in its absence a response from Parliament, this important new legislation cannot be introduced and the frustrations of many victims remain unaddressed,"" Mr McGuigan said. The report praised the ""excellent work"" of voluntary and community groups, such as Women's Aid, in helping victims in the face of funding pressures. But it should not be seen as an alternative ""to a formalised support scheme"". Nine years ago, the inspector recommended a properly-funded service be established ""as a matter of urgency"" and also endorsed grouping domestic offences together in court on specific days. ""Neither of these key initiatives have yet been implemented. In my view there is no excuse,"" said Mr McGuigan. Specialist training According to police figures, domestic abuse incidents hit a record high of almost 30,000 last year. But the report said three in five offences were not prosecuted due to ""evidential difficulties"" and more needed to be done by the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland). ""With more victims coming forward, we recommend improvements be made to enhance the response provided by frontline officers and ensure consistency in their approach."" The PSNI said it welcomed the report. ""We fully understand how difficult it can be for anyone to come forward,"" said Det Ch Supt Paula Hilman. ""We have delivered training to frontline officers as well as specialists dealing with victims and this will be kept under review."" 'Matter of urgency' Kelly Andrews added that victims in Northern Ireland deserved the same protection as that offered across the rest of the UK and Ireland, but said it would take a minimum of two years for legislation to be implemented once passed. She said particular attention should be paid to legislation around coercive control and stalking. She added: ""Families in Northern Ireland are living in terror, children are living in terror. ""Northern Ireland is lagging behind the rest of the UK and there is a gap in the legislation - it does not cover the full breadth of domestic abuse, which is not just physical. ""We have been lobbying for the secretary of state or Home Office to bring this legislation forward as a matter or urgency.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
France to ban culling of unwanted male chicks by end of 2021,"About seven billion male chicks - not wanted for meat or eggs - are killed around the world each year, usually in shredding machines or by gas. The government said new methods were emerging that would make it possible to test the sex of embryos inside the egg. But some campaigners said the reforms did not go far enough. What are the changes in France? French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume announced the reforms at a press conference in Paris on Tuesday. ""From the end of 2021, nothing will be like it was before,"" he said. Mr Guillaume said he hoped a method would soon be developed that would allow the sex of a chick to be determined before it had hatched. Researchers have been working on the issue for years, but are yet to come up with a solution that works on an industrial scale. The 2021 ban will make France one of the first countries to outlaw the practice of culling male chicks. A court in Germany has ruled that the practice can continue on a temporary basis until an alternative can be found. France and Germany last year said they would work together to put an end to mass chick culling. Mr Guillaume also announced on Tuesday that the practice of castrating piglets without anaesthesia would be banned by the end of 2021. Castration is performed to prevent ""boar taint"" - a potent smell or taste that can occur in the meat of non-neutered pigs. Several countries have already made the use of anaesthesia obligatory. How widespread is male chick culling? The mass-killing of male chicks shortly after birth is common practice in food production around the world. For the billions of hens used in egg and poultry farming every year, a similar number of male chicks are killed shortly after birth. Male chicks are viewed in the industry as commercially useless, because they grow more slowly than hens so are deemed unsuitable for meat production. After sorting, the most common methods of killing involve asphyxiation by gassing or maceration in high-speed grinders. Last year, Switzerland outlawed maceration. What has the response been? Many animal rights activists welcomed the changes in France but said they did not go far enough. They are ""a step in the right direction, but still inadequate"", Anissa Putois of the campaigning group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) told AFP news agency. French animal protection group L214 said the measures were ""not ambitious"" and ""do not address the basic problems"". ""There is nothing on slaughter conditions, nor on how to exit from intensive animal farming,"" it said, according to AFP. You might be interested in watching:",Human,English,BBC,,,1

'Potent' psychoactive drugs on the rise in Wales,"Samples tested showed there were fewer types of new illegal psychoactive drugs being sold in Wales - but those being dealt are 'ultra potent' varieties. Public Health Wales said it has led to more hospital admissions - and more deaths. However, the most common drug found in tests by the Wedinos project in Wales was still cocaine. The project allows drug samples to be submitted anonymously for analysis, and helps paint a picture of what types of drug are in circulation in Wales. In its annual report published on Friday, Wedinos revealed that over 1,345 drug samples were passed to it for testing in 2016-17 - revealing about 125 different substances. The number of drug types is down 23% on 2015-16, when 163 different drugs were indentified. While cocaine and the sedative diazepam topped the table for the most commonly used drugs tested by health laboratories, synthetic cannabis products came in at number three. The tests also revealed two specific types of new psychoactive substances (NPS) were being dealt - which have the official labels 5F-ADB and AMB-FUBINACA. These powders, most often made in laboratories in China, are mixed with herbs and sold on the street as Spice and Black Mamba. ""New psychoactive substances coming on to the market in Wales and across Europe pose a number of threats, with users at risk of actual harm,"" said Josie Smith, from Public Health Wales. ""It has never been so important to encourage all individuals using or considering using drugs to be well informed, aware of what they may be taking and of ways to reduce harm to themselves and others."" All types of NPS were made illegal in 2016 following mounting concerns about their use. Official figures have revealed that 123 people died in Wales and England in 2016 using NPS drugs. However, the toll is a fraction of the deaths related to heroin or morphine, which were 1,209 in 2016. But health officials said the rise in ultra-potent NPS drugs had led to a ""substantial increase in hospitalisations"" in Wales. The Wedinos project also identified a rise in other drugs coming into Wales - including a number of samples of the super-strength opiate fentanyl, which has been responsible for an epidemic of overdose deaths in the USA. In one case, it even found a sample of the similar drug carfentanil - which is so strong, it is used to sedate elephants. ""The work of Wedinos has never been more important in evidencing the shift in drug markets and the impact on individuals,"" added its project manager, Dean Acreman.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Plastic bag use in Wales halves in four years,"Shoppers in Wales will have to pay the 7p charge from next spring. The British Retail Consortium said educating customers, not penalising them, is the best way forward. Environment Minister Jane Davidson said charging was essential ""to make a difference to the number of bags used"". The Welsh Assembly Government announced in June that they were to introduce the mandatory charge for single use bags, the first UK nation to do so. The latest figures on bag use among seven supermarkets have been independently monitored by WRAP (Waste & Resource Action Programme). The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the number of carriers used in Wales fell from 53 tonnes to 26.6 tonnes in the year to May 2010. It said the drop was ""significantly better"" than the average of 45% for the whole UK. BRC said it shared the assembly government's aim of reducing bag use but introducing a charge would hit the worst off the hardest. It said Wales also had the best record in the UK in reducing the weight of material used. Stephen Robertson, the BRC director general, said goods sold in Wales by participating retailers grew by more than 5% between 2006 and 2009. ""Achieving the best reduction in bag use of all the UK nations shows what the voluntary approach can achieve when combined with the high profile given to the issue by the Welsh Assembly Government. He added: ""Despite the continued improvement, we're disappointed the Welsh Assembly Government is still pushing ahead with introducing a bag charge - the first country in the UK to impose these extra costs on shoppers. ""It's particularly bad news at a time when people are already watching the pennies and a move that will hit low-income families especially."" Voluntary agreement But Ms Davidson said: ""Carrier bags are an environmental menace. ""We know that altogether last year we used more than 400m bags in Wales alone, with most of those ending up littering our countryside or rotting in landfill and releasing harmful greenhouse gasses into the environment. ""Whilst I am pleased that Wales is continuing to make steady progress in reducing its use of bags, there's no doubt that progress in this area is starting to peter out and that we are still using far too many bags per person."" The minister said that proved a voluntary agreement has helped to dramatically reduce the number of bags used but a more formal arrangement is now needed. ""The carrier bag charge will give us the incentive we need to keep improving in this area and I am confident that once the charge is implemented, Wales' performance will increase dramatically. She also said the fact that Wales is doing better at reducing bag use was because of the efforts of retailers and customers and the discussion, publicity and general momentum gathering before the charge is introduced.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Belfast Royal Academy changes admissions criteria,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent Belfast Royal Academy (BRA), which has more than 1,400 pupils, said the change followed ""detailed"" legal advice. Children seeking admission still need to have entered the AQE transfer test, which has been cancelled this year. But priority will then be given to a proportion of children entitled to FSM. They will be selected from the group who put the school as their first choice in the admissions process. Under the changed criteria, they will be given priority ahead of children who currently attend BRA's prep school or children with a sibling at the school. The transfer tests run by the AQE and the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC) were cancelled in early 2021. As a result, grammar schools - which are attended by about 45% of post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland - have had to draw up new criteria for how they will select pupils in 2021. The vast majority of grammars are not using any academic data to admit pupils for 2021. The Irish News had previously reported that BRA was facing a legal challenge to its admissions criteria due to the initial priority it had given to children attending its prep school. In a letter to parents on Monday, BRA's governors said that ""in light of detailed advice received recently from senior counsel"" they had amended the school's admissions criteria. They said BRA was ""integrated and inclusive and the envy of almost every other local post-primary school"". ""For more than 235 years, Belfast Royal Academy has served as a beacon of hope, tolerance, and mutual understanding,"" their letter said. ""We are one of the most diverse school communities in Northern Ireland in terms of religion, gender, race, ethnicity and socio-economic background. ""For every 10 pupils, four come from the Protestant tradition, three come from the Catholic tradition, and three come from other religious traditions and none. ""One in six of our pupils is entitled to free school meals; and one in 10 of our pupils has special educational needs. ""The record of Belfast Royal Academy in relation to diversity and inclusion is second to none and it would be much better for Northern Ireland as a whole if more schools followed our example."" BRA was one of the first grammar schools to decide not to use the AQE test to admit pupils this year. However, the governors also told parents that ""the school remains of the view that academic selection is the fairest way of allocating places to children who apply to the school"". BRA normally admits 200 pupils into year eight every year but in previous years has had about 300 applications for those places. Parents can begin applying to post-primary schools which they want their children to attend on 1 March.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Do Amish hold clue to preventing asthma in children?,"Now it appears that their closer contact with animals could have an unexpected benefit - preventing asthma in children. A new study from the US compared the Amish with a similar community, the Hutterites, who use more modern farming methods. Both groups have similar genetic ancestry and follow similar diets, but researchers found that childhood asthma rates differed strongly. About 5% of Amish schoolchildren tested in the study had asthma compared with 21.3% of the Hutterite children. The study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that children's immune systems in the Amish community were being bolstered by house dust that contained more microbes from farm animals. Barns closer to homes The findings echo other studies that have suggested that a lack of early exposure to microbes, caused by modern hygiene, increases the risk of allergy. The dust found in Amish homes was ""much richer in microbial products,"" the study said. ""Neither the Amish nor the Hutterites have dirty homes,"" said study co-author Carole Ober, professor and chairman of human genetics at the University of Chicago. ""Both are tidy. The Amish barns, however, are much closer to their homes. Their children run in and out of them, often barefoot, all day long. There's no obvious dirt in the Amish homes, no lapse of cleanliness. It's just in the air and in the dust."" Blood tests from 30 children from each community, aged seven to 14, showed that the Amish youngsters had more neutrophils - white blood cells crucial to fighting infections. The study found the Amish children also had fewer blood cells that promote allergic inflammation, known as eosinophils. Laboratory mice exposed to Amish house dust were also protected against asthma-like responses while similar experiments with dust from Hutterite homes gave no protection. Are pets a protection? Report co-author Erika von Mutius, professor at the Dr von Hauner Children's Hospital in Munich, said it was hoped that the research could help future generations of children. ""We hope that our findings will allow the identification of relevant substances that will lead to completely novel strategies to prevent asthma and allergy,"" she said. A large study from Sweden last year found that young children in a family with a pet dog were less likely to develop asthma. The study, by JAMA Pediatrics, found that exposure to a dog in the first year of life was linked to a 13% lower risk of asthma in later childhood among the 650,000 children the authors tracked. It also found that living on a farm with lots of animals seemed to confer even more protection. Speaking at the time, lead scientist Prof Tove Fall, of Uppsala University in Sweden, said: ""Our results confirmed the farming effect and we also saw that children who grew up with dogs had about 15% less asthma than children without dogs."" But she warned against getting a pet to try to cure an already allergic child. ""It won't work and will probably make the allergy worse,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Primark fire: Council to approve building application,"A fire in Bank Buildings in August has led to 14 businesses being closed - possibly for as long as four months. The council's planning committee is to meet on Friday to consider the application, but a recommendation that it be accepted has been made. The council expects work to start ""as soon as practically possible"". Primark proposes demolishing the top floors of its historic premises and then rebuilding them using salvaged materials. It includes six chimneys - the most unstable parts of the building. It would allow work to start on the remainder of the building, to make it safe through a façade retention scheme. The company says once consent is granted, it will begin the work as soon as it can. The work would also make it possible to shrink part of the cordon around the building and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place. Impact of the Primark fire: By Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI Business Correspondent Belfast city centre is losing up to £3m a month due to the Bank Buildings fire. The figure is contained in a council report published ahead of a meeting to decide on Primark's action plan. It says the amount ""does not take into account the long-term economic impact of the fire."" The report also shows how shopper numbers have been affected. The Castle Court shopping complex has seen footfall crash by 49%. But Corn Market has seen shopper numbers rise by 24% due to the configuration of the cordon around Bank Buildings. There has been a 12% reduction in car parking revenue in the three weeks following the fire, compared with the preceding four weeks, while public transport passenger numbers have fallen by 28,250 (4%) compared with the previous year. Councillor Matt Garrett, chairman of the council's planning committee, said: ""Council has given a commitment to do all within its power to restore the city centre to the very vibrant place we know it to be. ""Thanks to our officers we have been able to turn round this application without delay, in just three weeks, and have called a special meeting of the council's planning committee in order to expedite this process."" He added: ""We recognise the urgency for businesses, both inside and outside the cordon, to ensure their economic resilience in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. ""As such, council has stated in its conditions of consent that it expects Primark to begin works as soon as practically possible, following the issue of this consent.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dale Farm travellers camp eviction notices served,"Basildon Council has given people living on 51 unauthorised pitches at Dale Farm, Essex, until the end of August to leave. More than 400 travellers currently live at the former scrapyard. About half of the 100 pitches do not have planning permission. Travellers began to set up pitches illegally on the greenbelt land in 2001. The notice requires them to vacate the land or the council will enter and dismantle the camp. Kathleen McCarthy, from Dale Farm, said a lot of the travellers were very distressed at the notices being served. 'People left homeless' Policing the clearance of what is thought to be the largest traveller site in Europe could cost up to £9.5m. The first £2.5m in costs are to be met by Essex Police Authority (EPA). The next £2.4m is to be shared equally between the Home Office and Basildon Council. A further £2.3m in costs will be met by the Home Office alone who will then share the remainder with the EPA. Richard Sheridan, president of the Gypsy Council, said it was unlikely residents would leave before the 28-day deadline expired. He said: ""You have to ask if it is value for money for taxpayers to pay millions for the police operation and millions more when these people are left homeless. 'Poor advice' ""They will not leave voluntarily so I suppose the police will have to go in and I don't suppose the residents will welcome them with open arms."" Basildon Council leader Tony Ball said he was ""concerned that a number of campaigners are giving poor advice to the travellers, leading them to pursue continual challenges rather than urging them to make preparations to leave"". Mr Ball added: ""I believe this has given the travellers false hope as it has made them believe a last-minute legal ruling could stop the site clearance. I feel these campaigners are doing a great disservice to the people they are attempting to help. ""As a result, over the years few people on this site have accepted our offers of help. That said, there is still absolutely no reason why children, the elderly or vulnerable should end up on the roadside.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
#MeToo in South Korea: Governor resigns after rape allegations,"In a Facebook post governor Ahn Hee-jung ""begged forgiveness"" for his ""foolish behaviour"" and said denials issued by his office were untrue. Kim Ji-eun, who said she was inspired by the #MeToo movement, accused him of raping her four times in eight months. The #MeToo campaign has slowly began to gain traction in South Korea. ""I apologise to everyone, especially Ms Kim Ji-eun,"" said Mr Ahn. ""Everything is my fault. As of today I will resign...[and] stop all my political activities."" The police are currently investigating the allegations of sexual assault, which Mr Ahn has neither explicitly admitted to nor denied. Mr Ahn, the governor of South Chungcheong province, was a political heavyweight. He ran against current President Moon Jae-in to be the Democratic Party of Korea's nominee for the 2017 presidential elections. Though he lost, he was widely seen as a leading candidate to replace Mr Moon in the 2022 elections. #MeToo On Monday night, Ms Kim appeared in an interview broadcast by local television network JTBC, where she made her allegations against Mr Ahn public. She accused the 54-year-old of raping her four times over the course of eight months, from June 2017 to February this year, and said he had sexually harassed her on many occasions. She also alleged there were other victims. Mr Ahn's office had initially claimed that he had consensual sex with Ms Kim. ""Our sexual relations were not consensual, and I'm sure he knows it. I was not in a position where I could say no,"" said Ms Kim in the interview, as reported by the Korea Times. Mr Ahn, who is married, said in his later statement that his office had ""falsely"" announced that the relationship was consensual. Ms Kim said the #MeToo campaign, sparked by the widespread allegations of sexual abuse in Hollywood, had given her the courage to come forward. ""After the movement came into the spotlight, Mr Ahn appeared to be anxious,"" said Ms Kim in the interview, as reported by the Korea Times. ""On 25 February he called me into his office and apologised. But then, he did it again."" The campaign, which has seen thousands using the hashtag to share their experiences of sexual harassment, has spread across the globe. It was slow to take off in South Korea, but recently gained ground after a number of women came forward. 'Betrayed and shocked' People South Korea have been expressing their disappointment at the news about Mr Ahn. ""I don't know what to do. I [feel] betrayed and shocked,"" said one user on Facebook. ""I thought he was a good politician."" ""I believed in you and supported you. You've taken my support, turned it into power and used it to control someone else,"" another user added. ""I thought you could be the one who could lead our country after Mr Moon. I can't believe it. I'm speechless,"" said one user. ""Kim Ji-eun, thank you for your courage. We will cheer you on,"" one commented.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Student exchanges in no-deal Brexit threat,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education and family correspondent It would mean that 17,000 UK students would not study in European universities as planned next year. The UK government had previously indicated it wanted to continue taking part in the exchange scheme. But Universities UK says new advice last week suggested no further support would be available in a no-deal Brexit. The universities organisation says, as a ""matter of urgency"", the UK government must ""reconsider its decision"" so that financial backing will be assured for students in the exchange scheme. Universities UK is launching a campaign calling on the government to commit to funding study-abroad placements for 2019-20 and beyond, even if there is no deal on Brexit. Wider horizons They say the updated information means that students already studying abroad will continue to be supported, under the current Erasmus+ scheme, but there is no provision beyond that. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says studying abroad has many benefits, including making students more employable and improving their language and communication skills. ""An investment in international experience for our students now is an investment in the future of our economy,"" he said. The Erasmus exchange scheme for students in Europe has been operating since the 1980s - and gives students the chance to study in another country for three to 12 months as part of their degree. Even after Brexit, the UK government had said it would continue to take part, such as paying to join as an associate member, along with other non-EU countries. The government's published plans on the UK's future relationship with the EU committed to ""continue to give young people and students the chance to benefit from each other's world-leading universities, including cultural exchanges such as Erasmus+"". But Universities UK is warning that seems to have been cast into doubt. The latest government position on Erasmus is that it ""aims to minimise the impact on projects in a no-deal scenario"" - but future participation will depend on negotiations. ""The government will need to reach agreement with the EU for UK organisations to continue participating in Erasmus+,"" says the updated official guidance. The government's advice says it is ""seeking to hold these discussions with the EU"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lebanon forms new government after long delay,"""We must turn the page and start working,"" said Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who is now in his third term. The 30-member cabinet has four women, including the interior minister - a first for Lebanon. The most pressing challenge for the cabinet is to revive Lebanon's economic fortunes and cut the national debt, which stands at about 150% of GDP. Mr Hariri's reforms are expected to unlock nearly $11bn (£8bn) in pledged international aid and loans. Who are the key figures in cabinet? Lebanon is governed by a complex power-sharing system aimed at representing all of its religious and political communities. Mr Hariri's new government will be composed of most of the country's rival factions, including the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah which - with its allies - made gains in parliamentary elections last May. One of the main sticking points until now has been how Hezbollah's Sunni allies, who oppose the prime minister, would be represented in government. They were eventually awarded one position in cabinet, while Hezbollah took two seats. Jamil Jabak was chosen as health minister by Hezbollah, although he is not a member of it. Other key members of the new cabinet are Ali Hassan Khalil and Gebran Bassil, who both remain as finance and foreign ministers respectively. Four women entered the government. Among them is Rhea al-Hasan, the country's new interior minister. Who is Mr Hariri? Despite being 48 years old, Mr Hariri is seen as a veteran in Lebanese politics. In 2017, he caused a significant political crisis when he announced his resignation on a routine trip to Saudi Arabia in a televised address, saying he feared an assassination attempt. He suspended his own resignation two weeks later after speaking to President Michel Aoun back in Lebanon. He denied speculation that Saudi Arabia had forced him to leave as part of a regional power struggle with Iran, and instead accused coalition partner Hezbollah and Iran of spreading strife in the region. Mr Hariri's father Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a bomb in 2005. Four men believed to be linked to Hezbollah are being tried in absentia at a UN-backed tribunal in connection with the attack, though the group denies any involvement. The announcement of the new government ends months of uncertainty following elections more than eight months ago. Lebanon has long had a power-sharing political system between the different religious denominations. The number of seats in parliament is split between Christians and Muslims, and the president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament must each come from a specific religious background.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Blindness and mental health can come hand in hand',"Elin Williams, 20, from Conwy Valley, was registered blind at 12 years old. She described growing up blind as ""very difficult at times"" and said she has had anxiety and panic attacks. Her parents found she could not see well at three years old and she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at six. Retinitis pigmentosa leads to the breakdown of light-detecting cells in the retina. According to the Royal National Institute of Blind People, only 17% of those who are visually impaired are offered emotional support in connection with their condition. Miss Williams, who lives an independent lifestyle and studies arts and humanities, specialising in English language, said blindness and mental health will always cause confusion. She said: ""I think there will always be a lack of understanding surrounding both topics, and especially when they're brought together."" Miss Williams explained she sometimes ""felt very lonely and I went through a period of suffering with anxiety and panic attacks as well"". She added: ""I've tried my best to overcome them as best as I can and come out stronger the other side."" Walking into a room and not knowing who was there can be anxiety-inducing for her and she said she did not want to go into rooms full of people. However, she began to channel her feelings through her blog, which ""helped massively"". Miss Williams added: ""I eventually became more confident in talking to people about it. ""I've had a really good support network in terms of family and friends, and they've helped me come through these things and helped me to become stronger and more confident."" She said there are charities and services available that are doing ""amazing things to help, so hopefully the stigma can be broken one day"". She continued: ""I think it's about understanding that blindness and mental health can come hand in hand... anxiety can be triggered from not being able to see people and not being able to see the world like everyone else. ""But it's all about telling people that although there are challenges, it's possible to live a positive life despite having sight loss.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Paris attacks: Salah Abdeslam stays silent in French court,"Friday morning's court hearing at the Palace of Justice in the centre of Paris was not open to the public. Salah Abdeslam is thought to have played a key role in planning the Paris attacks and transporting the attackers. The co-ordinated attacks by so-called Islamic State in November killed 130. Dozens more were severely wounded. Salah Abdeslam is being held in the high-security Fleury-Merogis jail just outside Paris. He was brought to the court amid tight security on Friday morning. ""He did not want to say anything,"" his lawyer Frank Berton said after the hearing. Mr Berton said his client was ""particularly disturbed"" by 24-hour video surveillance in his cell. He felt ""watched"", the lawyer told France Info. ""This does not lead him to co-operate with legal proceedings,"" he added. A lawyer representing some of the victims' families, Gerard Chemla, said Abdeslam had a moral duty to help the authorities. ""If this man has a conscience, he will co-operate with judicial authorities and will make it so that what happened doesn't happen again,"" Mr Chemla said before the hearing got under way. France's inquisitorial justice system means judges are responsible for investigating the case and questioning suspects ahead of any trial. Salah Abdeslam is being investigated over charges of terrorism-related murder and attempted murder. Arrested in Brussels in March after months on the run, he was transferred to French custody last month. His arrest took place just four days before the Brussels bombings and he has been linked to several of the suspects believed to have carried out those attacks. Belgian authorities have been accused of failing to connect him and his brother, Brahim Abdeslam, to ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Brahim Abdeslam blew himself up on 13 November while Abaaoud was killed during a police raid in Paris days afterwards. The Belgian authorities have already admitted to key blunders in the months leading up to the Paris and Brussels attacks. And further alleged failings involving Salah Abdeslam were reported by Belgian broadcaster RTBF on Monday. Separately, one of the suicide attackers at the Bataclan concert hall was buried on Friday morning at a cemetery in his home town in Alsace, according to radio network France Bleu (in French). The remains of Foued Mohamed-Aggad, 23, were interred in the Muslim section of the cemetery in Wissembourg, with 20-30 police present, the report said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Serious failings' in Glan Clwyd Hospital care of patient who died,"The patient, Mr X, had a history of chronic renal failure and died at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, in 2014. The ombudsman said his family ""will never know"" if he could have been saved had he received ""timely treatment"". Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board admitted failings in his care. The report by ombudsman Nick Bennett said Mr X, who also had other medical conditions, had received dialysis at the hospital three times a week since February 2012. After becoming seriously ill while on holiday abroad in February 2014, he was brought back to Glan Clwyd but was not seen by a consultant until the following day. His wife, referred to as Mrs X, complained about the decision not to treat her husband immediately in the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) which she believed would have increased his chances of survival. She also complained about the ""misplacing"" of Mr X's medical notes for six months following his death, the report said. Mr Bennett said his death was ""potentially avoidable"" and found a number of serious failings including: He made recommendations to the health board, including that it pays £20,000 to Mrs X ""for the distress caused by the manner of her husband's death"". He also called for improvements to renal patients' care. Mr Bennett said: ""It is a travesty that Mr X waited over 12 hours before being seen by a senior clinician and that the absence of specialist renal consultants at the hospital meant crucial dialysis treatment sadly came too late. ""Mr X's family will always have to live with the uncertainty of knowing that had the opportunities for treatment been taken his life could potentially have been saved. This is a significant injustice."" In response, the health board's chief executive Gary Doherty said improvements had since been made. ""I am truly sorry that we did not deliver the standard of care that we should have, and I will be contacting the family directly to offer our apologies both for this, and the way the complaint was subsequently handled,"" he said. ""We have taken note of all of the ombudsman's comments and accept all the recommendations that he has made. ""We will build on the work we have already done to ensure that all of these are implemented in full, and will be reporting our progress on this to the ombudsman in three months.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Everest: Indian police couple's summit claim investigated,"Dinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod told reporters this month that they reached the 8,850m (29,035ft) summit on 23 May. But some mountaineers alleged the couple, who are both police officers, faked their achievement by circulating digitally altered photos of the climb. Mr and Mrs Rathod deny the claims, as do the guides who climbed with them. Contacted by the BBC, Tarakeshwari Rathod insisted that she and her husband had ""climbed Everest"". The pair work as constables in the western Indian city of Pune, where police are now carrying out an inquiry. A senior Pune police official told the BBC that officers were ""clarifying the facts with the couple and a group of mountaineers"" who had objected to their claim. ""The couple have [climbing] certificates from Nepal government's tourism and mountaineering department. We will approach the government to find out whether these certificates are genuine,"" the official, who preferred to remain unnamed, said. 'Dream realised' The Rathods held a press conference on 5 June to announce that their ""dreams have been realised"" and they had scaled the summit. But Pune-based climber Surendra Shelke, who is one of a number of Indian mountaineers to have raised doubts about the couple's claim, said his suspicions ""were first aroused owing to the time lag between the day the Rathods claimed to have reached the summit and their press meet announcing their achievement"". They also alleged that some of the photographs circulated by the couple showing them on the climb had been photoshopped. Other allegations are that the couple could not have reached the summit so soon after they were seen to have arrived at base camp, and that the photos appear to show them in two different sets of clothes and boots while on the climb. However, the chief of Kathmandu-based Makalu Adventure, which organised the ascent, told the BBC he had ""no doubt"" the couple had scaled the world's highest peak. The company's website also contains pictures of the couple that they say were taken on the summit. ""They were taken to the summit by sherpas who worked for my company for several years and they reached the summit on 23 May,"" Mohan Lamsal told the BBC. Mr Lamsal said Mrs Rathod had contracted pneumonia on the way down, and his company had sent a helicopter to fly her out from base camp to Kathmandu for treatment. ""She was in hospital for a week. Only after she recovered, could the couple hold a press meet in India to announce the summit."" Mr Lamsal said Nepalese authorities had issued the climbing certificates to the couple after ""investigating the matter and interviewing the couple"" following complaints by some climbers in India.

"Coronavirus: France sets daily record with almost 10,000 new cases","Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Thursday, surpassing the previous daily record by almost 900. The figures were released on the eve of a key meeting of ministers and health experts about toughening measures. France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world. More than 30,800 people in the country have died of coronavirus. The number of patients in intensive care units in the country has also been rising in recent days. While hospital figures are still far from the peaks reached in April, there are concerns over the strain that rising infection rates could put on the health system. In the meeting on Friday, officials will discuss introducing new measures to curb the spread of the virus. The head of the scientific council advising the government on the pandemic, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, has warned that ""tough"" decisions may be required. President Emmanuel Macron said the meeting would give the public a clear idea of what can be expected in the coming weeks. ""We need to be as transparent and clear as possible,"" he said on Thursday, according to AFP news agency. ""We need to be demanding and realistic without giving in to any kind of panic."" The country earlier this month unveiled a major economic stimulus package, aimed at helping to repair the economic damage caused by coronavirus. Dubbed the ""France re-launch"", it is aimed at reversing rising unemployment, and includes tax cuts for business. What is happening elsewhere in Europe? Other countries in Europe are also seeing increases in coronavirus cases. The UK's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by more than 2,000 for the fifth consecutive day on Thursday, as England put mainland Portugal back on its quarantine list. England is also preparing to implement new restrictions, banning social gatherings of more than six people. Spain this week became the first country in the European Union to record more than half a million Covid-19 cases, after adding some 100,000 new cases in the past month. The World Health Organization has warned of a possible resurgence of the disease in Europe in October and November. A number of countries have re-imposed local lockdowns in their worst-affected regions, and there have been renewed appeals for people to wear face masks and follow social distancing rules.

BP selling part of Magnus field and Sullom Voe stakes to EnQuest,"EnQuest will secure 25% of BP's Magnus stake, and a 3% share of the Shetland facility. It is expected that about 100 BP staff linked with Magnus, and about 240 at Sullom Voe, will also transfer to EnQuest. The company will have future options to take full ownership of Magnus and a larger Sullom Voe stake. The deal also includes 25% of BP's interests in several associated pipeline systems. Magnus is the UK's most northerly field, located 160km (100 miles) north east of the Shetland Islands. The sale price of $85m is expected to be met from Enquest's share of future cash flows from the assets. The agreement will not include any upfront payment to BP. BP said EnQuest's record of extending the life of mature assets made them a natural operator for the interests. BP North Sea regional president Mark Thomas said: ""Sullom Voe and Magnus have been great businesses for BP, but to maximise the economic life of these important assets, we believe this deal will offer them a better long-term future."" The union Unite said there should be no change to the terms and conditions of any worker moving over to EnQuest. Regional officer John Boland said: ""When transfers like this happen, there is often a concern about potential job losses. ""We strongly hope that is not the case here, and we will be talking with BP and EnQuest to get a clear idea of their plans for the future so our members are fully informed."" 'Positive signal' Industry body Oil and Gas UK welcomed the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""This is an innovative deal which will open a new chapter in the life of Sullom Voe and the productive life of Magnus, an iconic North Sea oil field. ""It also sends a very positive signal on the opportunities available in the North Sea and is an indication of confidence that, even after producing oil for more than 30 years, this mature field still has more to give."" She added: ""The transfer of assets and infrastructure builds on a long-term trend to see 'the right mature assets' move into the right hands of established UK mature field operators and sees a fresh commitment to exciting development opportunities by established incumbent companies.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Samsung expects profits to double from smartphone boost,"The company said it expects an operating profit 5.8tn won ($5.1bn; £3.2bn) for the period. The success of Samsung's Galaxy range has seen it become the world's biggest-selling smartphone maker. Analysts said the firm had benefited from keeping its margins healthy, despite growing competition. ""There was a big surprise in profit, while revenue was in line, which suggests a stronger-than-expected profit margin from the handset division thanks to robust sales of high-end models like the Galaxy S and Note,"" said Choi D-Yeon of LIG Investment & Securities. ""Handset margins are estimated to have topped 20% and profits from the division also topped 4tn won."" The company will release its full earnings report on 27 April. Further growth? While Samsung's phone unit has prospered, other divisions, including memory chip manufacturing, have been going through a tough time. Prices for memory chips have been falling globally, not least due to oversupply. Analysts said that natural disasters last year in Japan and Thailand had resulted in a fall in production of various electronics products, which use these chips, resulting in high inventory levels putting pressure on prices. At the same time, slowing demand from key markets such as the US and Europe hurt chipmakers. However, analysts said that as the global economy recovers and supply chains in the region get back on track, chip prices were likely to recover, boosting Samsung's profits further. ""With memory chip prices rising, chips will play a big part in second quarter profits,"" said Kim Sung-in, a chip analyst with Kiwoom Securities. ""Expectations for operating profit will reach somewhere between 6.5tn to 7.5tn won."" Challenges While the company is expected to grow further, analysts warned that Samsung will have to overcome potential hurdles on the way. To begin with, it will have to fend off competition from its biggest rival Apple, they said. ""Samsung and Apple are expected to launch the new Galaxy S and iPhone in the second quarter, and they will engage in full-fledged war,"" said Lee Ka-keun of Hana Daetoo Securities. The fear is that increased competition may force Samsung to lower its prices in a bid to attract customers, a move which, if implemented, would impact on its profit. At the same time, Samsung is also involved in a legal battle with Apple over patents involving technology it uses in its smartphones and tablet PCs. The outcome of those cases will have an impact on its growth going forward.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Schools could close to tackle virus outbreak,"The first minister told the BBC's Politics Scotland they may have to consider closing schools and delaying non-urgent hospital procedures. But she stressed that their decisions would be ""really strongly underpinned"" by scientific advice. Eighteen people have so far tested positive for the Covid-19 virus in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said she expected the number to rise ""perhaps rapidly in the days to come"". ""It is now likely that we are facing a significant outbreak of coronavirus across the UK,"" she added. However, the ""vast majority"" of infected people would experience only very mild symptoms and would not need hospital treatment. Experts are currently working to contain the spread of the virus in Scotland. The first minister said that when that ""ceases to be possible"" action will be taken to slow down its spread. If they can reduce the number of infected people at any one time, that will reduce the pressure on the health service. She admitted school closures ""could be considered"" in a bid to slow the spread of the virus but no decisions have been taken. ""There are balances - quite difficult balances - and quite difficult judgements to be made here,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""We have some of the best scientists in the country looking at the kind of measures that would have the greatest impact on slowing down the spread of the virus. ""That has to be balanced by how practical those measures are to implement and, of course, the society and economic impact. ""There are some careful judgements that politicians and ministers will have to take but the focus is on doing everything we possible can to slow down the spread of this."" 1,939Negative test results 18Positive test results 273Positive cases in UK 3Deaths in the UK 106,000Approximate positive cases globally 3,600 Approximate deaths globally Work to increase capacity in hospitals could include the postponement of non-urgent procedures.

On the issue of welfare payments, the first minister said the Scottish government would do what it could within its powers to support the most vulnerable people affected by the virus She said ministers were holding ""good discussions"" with the UK government on issues including the relaxation of Universal Credit. ""We don't want people who are doing the right thing - self-isolating to limit the spread of the virus - being sanctioned in terms of their benefits.""

Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry: Pupils 'robbed' of their childhoods,"Paul Reid, representing the English Benedictine Congregation, said it had ""taken too long"" for the pupils affected to be heard and believed. His comments were made during closing statements in the latest phase of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. It has been looking at schools linked to the Benedictine order. In particular it has been investigating Carlekemp in North Berwick and Fort Augustus Abbey in the Highlands. In 2013, a BBC investigation, ""Sins of Our Fathers"", uncovered allegations that pupils had suffered physical and sexual abuse at the schools over three decades. The inquiry has heard that one former teacher at Fort Augustus Abbey, Thomas Seed, known as Father Benedict, was found guilty last year of physical abuse against a pupil at the school while extradition proceedings are ongoing overseas regarding other abuse allegations. Mr Reid told the inquiry in Edinburgh: ""The core truth remains that pupils at Carlekemp and Fort Augustus Abbey were subject to abuse and a schooling which robbed them of their childhood and has caused lasting damage to them and their families. ""The English Benedictine Congregation regrets very much this was able to happen in schools in membership of the congregation. ""It has taken too long for them to be heard and believed and the congregation is sorry this has been so and repeats its unreserved apology to all affected."" 'Pass the paedophile' Colin MacAulay QC, senior counsel to the inquiry, told the hearing: ""If the main body of evidence is accepted, then there were brutal regimes involving excessive punishment at both Carlekemp and Fort Augustus Abbey. ""There was evidence that bullying was prevalent and indeed tolerated... and a body of evidence implicating Carlekemp and Fort Augustus Abbey in the sexual abuse of children."" He told the inquiry this covered decades at both schools as he highlighted the movement of monks between schools and overseas. Mr MacAulay said it was ""difficult to believe that the monks did not know that children were being sexually abused at both schools"". John Scott QC, representing the In Care Abuse Survivors (Incas) group, said: ""The congregation either didn't know what was going on, in which case they failed in their observing role, or they knew but took no action, in which case they were complicit in covering up abuse. ""The true answer might be a bit of both."" He added: ""It may be that the clear evidence of known and suspected abusers being moved on is one of the worst aspects."" He said witnesses spoke of abusers being moved to other church roles in Canada and Australia, with one describing it as ""pass the paedophile"". He said this was at times ""suggestive of a network"" and added: ""It is little wonder that people see the church as having involved paedophile rings, crossing monasteries, crossing borders and crossing continents"". The inquiry in Edinburgh begins a new phase on Thursday, focusing on the Marist Brothers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Loving v Virginia: Lawyer in famed interracial marriage case dies,"Bernard S Cohen represented the Loving couple in a lawsuit against the state of Virginia in 1967. Their name ensured it would be a landmark case, he told US media. The ruling was later used in 2015 as precedent to legalise gay marriage. Cohen went on to serve as an ""unabashed liberal"" state lawmaker. His most famous clients - Richard and Mildred Loving - were arrested in their marriage bed only weeks after their wedding in 1958. They pleaded guilty to violating the state's Racial Integrity Act, and avoided one year in jail by agreeing to keep out of the state for 25 years. In a 1992 interview with the Associated Press, Cohen said that while discussing legal strategy with his clients, Mr Loving simply told him: ""Mr Cohen, tell the court I love my wife and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia."" Cohen added: ""I knew it was going to be a landmark case."" ""I knew it was going to the Supreme Court. And I definitely thought there was something serendipitous about the fact that the case would be called Loving vs the Commonwealth of Virginia."" Because the couple had pleaded guilty, to get it to the Supreme Court, Mr Cohen and his partner Philip Hirschkop were forced to appeal the decision. During the appeal, a Virginia judge ruled: ""Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. ""And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."" The Supreme Court overturned the decision in a unanimous decision, with chief Justice Earl Warren calling anti-interracial marriage laws ""odious to a free people"". Nick Kroll, the actor who played Cohen in the 2016 film Loving, was among those paying homage to him on Twitter. Cohen was born in Brooklyn and received his law degree from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He ran a private practice in Virginia before serving in the state's House of Delegates from 1980 to 1996. During his time in office, he helped pass a public smoking ban despite intense pressure from the tobacco lobby. He died at home in Virginia on Monday from complications due to Parkinson's disease, according to his family.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Eurovision Song Contest: Bonnie Tyler's hopes for final,"By Huw ThomasBBC Wales arts and media correspondent Her public appearances in Malmo, the Swedish city hosting the event, have drawn the largest crowds and the biggest cheers. One of the reasons the fans have taken to her so well is that she will talk to anyone. Her habit of stopping to chat to whoever approaches her led to some in her team worrying about the effect that all the talking will have on her voice. But Bonnie cannot be contained. Since arriving in Malmo she has barely stopped. Between official Eurovision duties - which include rehearsals, press conferences and photo-calls - she has also performed at fringe events and sat through countless interviews with journalists from around the world. While her energy and enthusiasm are applauded, she has also earned respect for her realistic approach to her Eurovision chances. Mention the final and she will tell you she is staying positive, but ask if she will win and you will get a cackle that hints that the optimism does not stretch as far the top of the scoreboard. Among the Eurovision fans who have travelled to Malmo there's a real buzz about Bonnie, but they are also quite frank about whether they think her song - Believe in Me - can win the support of the TV audiences of Europe. They think Bonnie is great, but would they pick up the phone for her? It has been tough finding many who will say ""yes"". Bonnie has done her best to put to bed the notion that Britain does not take Eurovision seriously. She has explained how she used to watch it with her parents when she was growing up, and how her mum would have been so pleased that she'll be representing the UK on stage in Malmo on Saturday night. But it will take more than the singer from Skewen, near Neath, to heal the British relationship with Eurovision. One German journalist told me the UK was consistently choosing established acts that it thought would appeal to Europeans, whereas he would rather a young talent was given the chance to shine. When I suggested the fresh faces may fear Eurovision will prematurely terminate their careers, he did not understand why the competition could be bad for them. Try recalling 10 years' worth of UK entries and you will probably struggle to get halfway there, unless you are a die hard Eurovision fan. Bonnie Tyler is the biggest name for some time to grace the contest's stage, but even she will struggle to win over a Eurovision audience that still perceives Britain as the child at the edge of the playground who is pointing and laughing at everybody else.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Grizzly Bear Spirit' case at Canada's Supreme Court,"The Ktunaxa First Nation say the resort would desecrate land where their sacred Grizzly Bear Spirit lives. British Columbia says adequate accommodations have been made. It will be the first time the Supreme Court determines the merits of an indigenous religious freedom claim under the Canada's rights charter. In March 2012, the British Columbia (BC) government approved the disputed Jumbo Glacier ski resort development planned in a remote valley in the province's mountainous southeast. The contentious project would be built on the site of an abandoned saw mill in remote BC, in a region revered by backcountry skiers and snowboarders for its deep snow, wilderness, and stunning beauty. It is also a significant grizzly bear territory. The Ktunaxa Nation have resisted a scheme to build the Jumbo Valley resort since it was first proposed in 1991. They challenged the BC government's approval in court, saying the province failed to properly consider the sacred significance of the area. Both the BC Supreme Court and BC Court of Appeal have dismissed the Ktunaxa Nation claim. The Ktunaxa say the site, which they call ""Qat'muk"" is ""where the Grizzly Bear Spirit was born, goes to heal itself, and returns to the spirit world"". They are arguing the bear spirit would leave the area if the resort is built and they would no longer have access to its spirit and guidance. British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) executive director Josh Paterson says the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday will be the first time First Nations spirituality is considered in land use decisions like the Jumbo Valley resort. ""People would understand if this were a proposal that would destroy the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem or the Temple Mount,"" he said. The BCCLA is among the many interveners in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms case. Other Ktunaxa Nation allies include locals, conservationists and California-based alpine outfitter Patagonia, which has thrown its support behind a campaign to ""Keep Jumbo Wild"" and financed a documentary on the tug-of-war over the resort. Another First Nation, the Shuswap Band, which also has claims to the territory, have supported the Jumbo Valley ski resort proposal since 2004, when it first received its environmental certificate. That certificate has since expired. Oberto Oberti, the Vancouver-based developer behind Jumbo Glacier Resort, said he still hopes he and his partners will one day build a four-season glacier skiing destination in the valley. He said they have tried to address concerns and adjust the project to accommodate the local community over the last 20 years. And Oberti says he does not believe the resort would violate anyone's ability to believe in their faith or to practise it but is leaving it up to ""constitutional scholars"" to debate its impact on religious freedoms. ""We are just architects and will stick to that,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Restrictions on ex-prisoner advisers may deny opportunities,"Sir George Quigley was giving evidence to the Finance Committee on the Civil Service (Special Advisers) Bill. Jim Allister's private member's bill aims to ban those convicted of an offence with a sentence of five years, or more, from being a special adviser. Sir George said the move could deny ex-prisoners employment in other spheres. ""If everybody with a conviction of five years or more was going to be automatically denied employment elsewhere outside the special adviser range in Northern Ireland, that would concern me very considerably and the message that would send out,"" he said. ""Is it sensible to deny these people the opportunity to contribute, and is it reasonable for society to expect them to espouse peaceful democratic means to shape the future, but at the same time refuse them any place in that future?"" He, along with the former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service head, Sir Nigel Hamilton, explained that they had been asked to co-chair a working group to examine the problems facing ex-prisoners and their reintegration back into society. Sir Nigel said the party was made up of representatives from ex-prisoners and all paramilitary groups, trade unions, the Confederation of British Industry and government departments. ""I was surprised at the range of issues and blockages there were to reintegration,"" he said. Sir Nigel explained that an offence could be expunged from a record, but a similar offence committed in a conflict-related context would remain. He said the working group was set up to produce guidelines so that both were treated the same way. Sir George said it had recommended that those convicted of a conflict-related offence should be able to compete with other applicants for employment on a totally level basis, and the employer's decision should be made solely on the basis of an applicant's skills and experience. He added that only after an applicant had been recommended for a position, and only where relevant to a specific position, should a record check be taken. He said that the conviction would have to be ""materially relevant"" to the position and the onus would then be on the employer on whether or not to deny the person the position.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pirated Rihanna songs land Frenchman in court,"Alain Prevost was fined 150 euros (£121) for pirating two Rihanna tracks even though his wife admitted she downloaded the songs. The fine was levied on the 40-year-old because he paid for the web link over which the songs were downloaded. The French government agency policing downloading in the country is preparing cases against 14 other people it suspects of pirating movies and music. France operates a ""three strikes"" law which means suspected pirates get three warnings about their activity. If they ignore the warnings their net connection gets cut off and they can face further court action. Prevost, of Belfort, in eastern France, was convicted because he admitted in court that the Rihanna songs had been downloaded by his wife via the ISP account he paid for. In his court testimony, Prevost, described as a local artisan by French media, said he was ""incapable of downloading anything"". The case has been complicated by two other factors, reported French tech news site PC Inpact. First, Prevost terminated his web account after he received the first two warnings from the French agency, known as Hadopi, that seeks out pirates in France. Secondly, he is divorcing his wife. Court plea Prevost wrote to Hadopi telling it to contact his wife about the downloads. However, it replied via email messages he could no longer receive. For unwittingly ignoring Hadopi's messages, Prevost received a summons to visit his local police station where he wrote a statement repeating his claim that he did not download the songs. The police asked him to have the songs removed from his PC by a local firm and he took documentary evidence of this to court when he received a summons from Hadopi. Prevost told PC Inpact that he went to court without a lawyer to represent him, believing that his honesty and co-operation would count in his favour. For breaking the three strikes law, Prevost could have faced a fine of up to 1,500 euros (£1,200) and had his web connection cut off for a month. After making his statement in court, the 300 euro (£240) fine the prosecution sought was halved. Marie-Francoise Marais, head of Hadopi, speaking to local French newspaper Le Pays, said the agency ""was mainly a mission of education, not repression"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
David Essex takes EastEnders role as Eddie Moon,"The 1970s pin-up will play Eddie Moon, the father of Michael and uncle to Alfie. ""Eddie is the head of the family and will arrive with his children in tow heralding a new era for the Moon clan,"" said a BBC statement. Essex, who is himself from east London, said he was ""really excited to be joining the square"". ""Eddie Moon is a great character and I can't wait to get to grips with the role and work and such a fantastic cast."" Essex, 63, has been a successful singer and actor since the early 70s, notching up 23 top 30 singles in Britain alone and films including That'll Be The Day and Stardust. He first shot to fame after being chosen to play the role of Jesus in the musical Godspell in London's West End in 1971. His best known hits include Hold Me Close, Rock On and Gonna Make You A Star. In 1999 he was made an OBE in recognition of his services to charity. Bryan Kirkwood, executive producer of EastEnders, said: ""David Essex is a brilliant signing for EastEnders. ""He is a unique talent with a legion of fans, and he will bring warmth and charisma to the role of Eddie Moon. His arrival, alongside the return of son Michael, brings a new generation of the Moon family to Walford."" Despite making a fresh start, the character of Eddie Moon will bring new drama to the Moon family as his fractured relationship with Michael suggests a complicated past he would probably rather forget. The Moon family is currently going through a traumatic period as Alfie and Kat struggle to get on with their lives following the apparent death of their newborn son Tommy. The couple believe their son to have died in his cot on New Year's Eve. But the baby found in Tommy's cot was that of Ronnie Branning, who had swapped her child - a victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) - for Kat and Alfie's son. The storyline has prompted thousands of complaints to the BBC, who have subsequently announced the story will end in the spring after baby Tommy is reunited with his mother.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Manchester students want statue of 'racist' Gandhi rejected,"The 9ft (2.75m) statue has been given to the city council to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth. In an open letter, the students demanded the council acknowledges his ""vile comments"" and issues an apology. A council spokeswoman said the statue was intended ""to spread a message of peace, love and harmony"". The letter - which refers to the social media hashtag #GandhiMustFall - stated the anti-colonialist had referred to Africans as ""savages"", ""uncivilised"" and ""dirty"", comments which were ""well documented throughout his earlier correspondence and writings"". It added Gandhi was being ""used as a propaganda tool... by the current Indian government"", adding: ""We demand that Manchester City Council refuse to be complicit in this, especially given the city's history of anti-racist action."" It also demanded the council ""redistribute"" any funds used to ""instead commemorate a black anti-racist activist with connections to Manchester, such as Olive Morris or Steve Biko"". Was Mahatma Gandhi racist? He was born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to an elite family in India in 1869 and moved to South Africa in 1893, where he was struck by the ill treatment of Indian immigrants. Biographer and grandson Rajmohan Gandhi said he was undoubtedly ""at times ignorant and prejudiced about South Africa's blacks"", but the ""imperfect Gandhi was more radical and progressive than most contemporary compatriots"". Other authors have argued over his legacy in recent times - Ramachandra Guha wrote that ""to speak of comprehensive equality for coloured people was premature in early 20th Century South Africa"", while Ashwin Desai describes him as a man who ""supported more taxes on impoverished African people and turned a blind eye to the brutality of the Empire on Africans"". BBC News' Soutik Biswas: Was Mahatma Gandhi a racist? An authority spokeswoman said there would be ""no cost to the council for the statue"", which went through the ""necessary planning process"" in August without objection. It is currently in storage ahead of a planned unveiling in Manchester next month.

A spokesman for the SRMD said it was ""non-political and is not aligned with any national government"". The organisation welcomed ""a searching public discussion of the past [but] it is misleading to fixate on comments made in Gandhi's early life"", he said. ""Gandhi inspired African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, [and] this call is an extreme and limited interpretation [of him]. ""Mahatma Gandhi is a citizen of the world and an icon of peace.

Northern Ireland rescue teams facing snow drifts up to 18ft,"Police said they monitored more than 30 such incidents on Saturday and deployed rescuers to assist 10 people in need. The PSNI said some rescuers had to walk for miles through heavy snow to reach housebound people in some rural areas. Chief Inspector Tim Mairs said people were confronted with ""possibly 12 to 18ft drifts of snow"" in some places. Airlift The police said they were working closely with mountain rescue volunteers and other statutory emergency staff to provide assistance to people in difficulty due to the extreme weather. The RAF has also sent a Sea King helicopter, with a military mountain rescue team on board, from Anglesey in Wales to assist the rescue operation. The PSNI said there had been a ""multi-agency response"" to the situation, with ambulance staff, firefighters, Road Service, local councils, electricity providers, health providers, the Red Cross and rescue volunteers ""working closely together to help individuals"". Meanwhile, thousands of people are still without power due to damage to the electricity network and roads in many areas are blocked. Ch Insp Mairs said in one of the 10 more serious incidents, rescue teams had to airlift oxygen to a 79-year-old man. 'Weak and frail' The officer said the pensioner had been snowed in, had no electricity and no means of getting further oxygen supplies. ""Several attempts were made by local police to get to the man but the road was impassable,"" the chief inspector said. ""The police helicopter was then tasked to airlift the casualty to hospital. However, the man was unable to be moved as he was so weak and frail, so the helicopter was then used to deliver vital oxygen."" Ch Insp Mairs said that in other cases, search and rescue teams were ""going in on foot, using snow shoes to walk in, sometimes over miles and miles to provide medication to vulnerable people, to check that people who we've lost contact with are still alive"". 'Immense bravery' ""Those operations are going on right now as we speak and they have been ongoing over the last two days,"" he added. Ch Insp Mairs said the rescue effort represented ""immense bravery and commitment"" on the part of the volunteers and staff involved. ""What they are going through is challenging and its physically exhausting and many of these people have worked exceptionally long hours, but they do it in very safe way and their commitment is very high,"" he added.

Party outlines 'independence plan',"By Robin BrantNewsbeat political reporter The government in Edinburgh, which currently has powers over some of the laws in Scotland, has unveiled its proposal to go all the way and become completely independent. If the Scottish National Party (SNP) plans for a national vote get the go ahead, then Scotland could get its own government, own prime minister, maybe even its own army. Trevor - a Scot who used to live in England - owns a tattoo business in Langholm. ""There would be a lot more national pride if it was independent, away from England, away from Britain itself,"" he says. He also thinks it'd be better if Scottish taxes were spent exclusively on Scotland and its people. ""I'd rather it was kept here than being shipped off to support London and all that,"" he admits. Limited support The country having control over its own money is one of the big arguments for independence. However, so far it doesn't have big backing. The polls suggest that support for independence is lukewarm - about 30 or 40% in favour, but not a majority. Support for independence was higher two years ago when the Scottish nationalists won control of Scotland's parliament in Edinburgh. But then the economy hit a rough patch and Scotland felt the effects. Big Scottish banks, like RBS and HBOS, were almost wiped out. Tracey, who recently got laid off from her job in Langholm, says that now is the right time to go it alone. She says she's a proud Scot, but admits she usually identifies herself as British when filling in forms. ""I used to work in one of the mills here but was made redundant due to the way things are with the textiles and things. ""I'm open to persuasion if they've got a good enough reason, but as things stand I would be quite happy with things staying as before."" However, a vote on Scottish independence is unlilely to get the go-ahead in the near future because the other main Scottish parties don't think it's a priority. They say that at the moment it's more important to help the country deal with the recession and strengthen its parliament.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government denies paying British MP?s trips,"Speaking to journalists in Colombo on Wednesday Minister Maithripala Sirisena said “we totally deny these allegations of spending government funds to sponsor these visits”. He dismissed allegations of government spending as mere rumours. British investigation A BBC investigation into the parliamentary rules by MPs has found out that Shadow Defence Secretary Liam Fox has broke the rules on two occasions, having visited Sri Lanka five times in the past three years courtesy of its government. Liam Fox, MP, has failed to declare the hospitality when asking ministers how much UK aid had been given to Sri Lanka. A BBC investigation looked into which members had registered trips and declared those paid for by foreign governments. 'Must register' the visits Under British Parliamentary rules, MPs must register such foreign visits within four weeks and must declare a financial interest when tabling questions, motions or bills and when speaking out in the commons.Dr Fox has visited Sri Lanka in November 2007, on a trip paid for by the Sri Lankan government, but did not register it until February 2008 - outside of the four-week requirement. Also, the BBC found that Dr Fox visited Sri Lanka four times between 2008-2009 - all paid for by the Sri Lankan government.On April 30, 2008, he tabled a question about aid for Sri Lanka but did not declare an interest. Dr Fox said: ""I have been involved in attempts to promote peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, since I was a Foreign Office Minister in 1997.During my most recent visit I spoke at a press conference to outline my reasons for being there.” He says his visit in November 2007 was highlighted in the end of the year audit report. He added: ""All visits have been fully declared on the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests and are therefore public knowledge and entirely legitimate. I do however recognise that when asking one question in 2008, I should have noted an interest and the Registrar has been informed of this.” Labour party MP Andrew Love, who visited Sri Lanka in April 2006 and March 2008 courtesy of its government, has asked questions in the parliament related to Sri Lanka, without declaring an interest. BBC investigation also found out that On 24 May 2006, Mr Love tabled a debate about Sri Lanka without declaring any interest, although he did mention a recent visit. Mr Love told the BBC that while he may not have met ""the letter of the requirements of the code of conduct, I did more than meet the spirit of the code in terms of acting on all occasions in accordance with the public trust placed in me as an elected representative"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Christmas singles flood UK top 40 chart,"Twenty-one seasonal songs appear in the latest rundown, led by Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You. Mariah is at number two, kept off the top spot by Ariana Grande's Positions. Martin Talbot, head of the Official Charts Company, said it was ""very unusual"" to see such a ""surge of interest"" in festive tunes. The appetite for Christmas music ""essentially started in November"", Talbot said, with people throwing themselves into ""familiar TV, film, books and music as comfort from the miserable tone of so much of this year's news"". Wham's Last Christmas and Fairytale of New York by The Pogues with Kirsty MacColl have both gone back into the top 10 this week. ""The public are also buying their Christmas trees and putting up their decorations much earlier this year too, almost certainly finding solace in Christmas at the end of a year that most people want to put behind them as soon as possible,"" Talbot said. ""Who could dispute that, in 2020, we all deserve to start celebrating Christmas earlier than ever?"" Little Mix, Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa and Tate McRae are among the artists with non-Christmassy singles in the top 10. The 21 Christmas singles in the top 40: Gary Barlow's latest release Music Played by Humans topped the album chart, which he said felt to him like ""Christmas Day"", adding: ""What an honour, what a privilege, I can't believe it. This could, possibly, mean the most to me than any other before."" He was followed by Steps' new album What the Future Holds at number two. The album chart also featured plenty of Christmas cheer, with Michael Ball and Alfie Boe's Together at Christmas at number three, Andre Rieu and his Johann Strauss Orchestra at number eight with Jolly Holiday, and Michael Buble's Christmas at number nine. Miley Cyrus, AC/DC, Little Mix, Kylie Minogue and Shakin' Stevens also made it into this week's top 10 album chart, while BTS fell from number two last week to number 33 with Be.

Concerns over food hygiene 'scores on the doors' plan,"The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned ""scores on the doors"" ratings for restaurants and take-aways will be extended to producers and wholesalers. Meanwhile, a consumer group is concerned food outlets could be given more time to appeal, delaying ratings. Ministers say they will listen to views. The new law is looking to build on a voluntary scheme, in which restaurants, takeaways and supermarkets in Wales display food hygiene ratings. Businesses will be rated with a score between 0 and 5 - with 0 meaning urgent improvement is necessary and a 5 meaning hygiene standards are very good. Ratings will have to be displayed in a prominent position or businesses will face a fine. The FSB Wales says the Welsh government's assessment of the law's impact on food businesses has not been vigorous enough. It is concerned over proposals to include food producers, wholesalers and transporters to comply with the legislation as well as premises selling food. Iestyn Davies, head of external affairs for FSB Wales, said: ""There are a number of elements of the Bill that we agree with, including details around the right of a business to appeal a rating decision and the suggested timescales to do so. ""However, we are extremely concerned that an adequate regulatory impact assessment - an absolute staple of any robust legislation - does not appear to have been carried out in respect of the recent inclusion of business to business trade in the Bill. ""Effectively, this means that the Welsh government has included an entirely new category of businesses into this law with no consideration of the possible impact this might have."" The FSB is due to give its views about the legislation, along with Consumer Focus Wales (CFW), to the assembly's Health and Social Care Committee on Thursday. The CFW will raise the issue of the length of the appeal for food businesses, who will be given 21 days to appeal against ratings before they must display their ""scores on the doors"" or face a fine. The current voluntary system gives businesses seven days. CFW says this could delay the information being displayed by almost two months. Liz Withers, head of policy, said: ""We think the current timelines under the voluntary scheme of seven days were reasonable and proportionate. ""However, appreciating the concerns raised by authorities, perhaps extending this period to 10 days might be more appropriate. ""It is important that consumers are given information as quickly as possible without creating unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles."" The Welsh government wants the new statutory scheme to be in place by November 2013. A spokesperson said ministers were pleased that views had been submitted. A statement added: ""The committee is taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of stakeholders and is expected to report on its scrutiny of the Bill in October this year. ""The Welsh government will consider the committee's report and recommendations in the autumn.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Zimbabwe's Mnangagwa blames Grace Mugabe faction for blast,"Two people died and more than 40 were hurt in an explosion near Mr Mnangagwa at a rally in Bulawayo on Saturday. Mr Mnangagwa told the BBC's Fergal Keane that he suspected the G40 group, which supported Grace Mugabe for the presidency, had carried out the attack. Mrs Mugabe's husband, Robert Mugabe, was forced from power last year. The army intervened to oppose Mrs Mugabe's attempt to succeed her husband as the country's leader, and the ruling Zanu-PF party then sacked Mr Mugabe, replacing him with Mr Mnangagwa. An exiled member of the G40 group, former government minister Jonathan Moyo, earlier tweeted that the blast ""smacks of an inside job"". Mr Mnangagwa did not accuse Mrs Mugabe of being involved in the attempt on his life. He told the BBC he expects arrests to be made shortly. ""I don't know whether it was one individual - I would think it is broader than one person. I would think this is a political action by some aggrieved persons,"" he said. 'Unsettled nation' By BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane President Mnangagwa was emphatic. Whoever tried to kill him was part of a conspiracy rooted in the G40 faction. He did not blame Grace Mugabe for the attack but in accusing her supporters he has further isolated the former first lady. She is currently visiting Singapore, where her husband is receiving medical treatment. My impression is of a president who expects to win the 30 July election. He also struck me as being confident in the support of the international community and - critically - the Zimbabwean army as he faces his remaining internal enemies. Zimbabwe, in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt, is not an unstable country. But it is unsettled. The 'crocodile' who snapped back 'Soft as wool' Mr Mnangagwa described Mrs Mugabe as someone who had frequently insulted him in the past. ""On what basis would I trust someone who was used by a cabal to say things that had no basis?"" he asked. Nicknamed ""the crocodile"", Mr Mnangagwa has a reputation for being ruthless, but he told our correspondent: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life, my brother. I'm a family person. I am a Christian."" Despite the apparent attempt on his life, Mr Mnangagwa said there would be no countrywide security clampdown and elections scheduled for 30 July would go ahead in a free and fair manner. Zimbabwe was stable and that foreign investors should not worry, he said. Representatives of Zanu-PF, the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and other parties signed a peace pledge on Tuesday, promising to refrain from violence and hate speech during campaigning. The MDC's Nelson Chamisa is expected to be Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger in the election. He has also condemned the attack in Bulawayo.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Norwich pub landlord says staff having to 'police rule-benders',"James Linder of The Eagle in Norwich welcomed drinkers to the pub's garden on Monday after four months' closure. But he said guests reserving several tables at once for themselves and friends had put his staff in the position of ""policing people"", he said. Trade body UK Hospitality said: ""We need people to stick by the rules."" Outdoor drinking and dining was permitted again on Monday for the first time since England's lockdown began on 6 January, although Norfolk had already moved into tier 4 restrictions in December. Under government restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19, venues can currently only serve customers sitting outdoor in groups of up to six people or from two households. Speaking during a BBC Facebook Live, Mr Linder said while reopening his Newmarket Road pub had been ""really, really lovely"", there had been unnecessary extra pressures. ""The biggest challenge is... we've had people try to book under different names to try to form large groups - we've had to catch them out, which is not great,"" he said. ""With the greatest will in the world, they start mingling between the tables after a couple of drinks and forming one group. ""Once we're finding this is happening, we're turning the tables away, which means we've lost the tables booked out. ""It upsets the staff as well - they don't want to be going in and policing people."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents pubs, hotels and restaurants, said the industry needed ""customers to work with us"". ""The additional costs of operating with the social distancing restrictions are really quite significant,"" she said. ""We've all missed going out to our pubs, bars, restaurants, but we need people to abide by the rules... and be kind to those hospitality staff. ""They'll have been out of work for six months or more, they might be a little bit rusty,"" she said ""If they're asking you to do something... they're only doing it because they're needing to abide by the law and to keep you safe.""

Why has our weather been so wet?,"By Chris FawkesBBC Weather We have had the wettest April, the soggiest June and the wettest April to June period on record. And - if that doesn't depress you enough - there is no prolonged settled weather pattern on the horizon. Essentially, the main culprit is the six-mile high jet stream - a fast wind blowing around the planet that makes and moves our surface pressure systems. It's been stuck in a rut recently - and that's why we've been experiencing so much rain. An accelerating jet stream causes air to rise upwards through the atmosphere and creates low pressure centres - and a greater likelihood of rain - on the Earth's surface. It is powered by temperature contrasts between the cold polar regions of the planet and the hot tropics. The heatwave currently over the US has pushed the jet stream further north than is usual. How the jet stream has changed That's caused an unusually large area of high pressure over Greenland, and this has in turn pushed a north-westerly part of the jet stream over the UK. So for the past three months, Britain has found itself underneath an accelerating part of the jet stream, meaning low pressure has dominated the weather, causing record-breaking rain. Torrential rain But are there any changes expected to this weather pattern? Not at least for a fortnight - and probably longer - with low pressures continually forming over the British Isles. At times like these I would expect these low pressure systems to interact with warm, humid air from the continent bringing an ongoing risk of torrential rain and localised flooding. Normally we would wait for an ex-hurricane to move into the mid-Atlantic, bringing a surge of warm air northwards to knock the jet stream out of its rut. But we are forecasting a quieter season than normal, with no Atlantic hurricanes on the way. And that means we may be stuck with this weather pattern for a while yet. Perhaps we should cross our fingers that August will bring a change of fortunes. *New figures are compared with the 1971-2000 rainfall average, which was 72.6mm",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vatican suspends 'bishop of bling' Tebartz-van Elst,"Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is accused of spending more than 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on renovating his official residence. The Vatican said it deemed ""appropriate... a period of leave from the diocese"" for the bishop. The suspension comes two days after he met the Pope to discuss the matter. ""A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties"", a Vatican statement said. It said a Church commission would rule on the matter, but did not say where Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would go or what he would do while the inquiry was held. The head of Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, Alois Glueck, welcomed the Vatican's decision. He said: ""Pope Francis's decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation has become an increasing burden for the faithful there, and in all of Germany, over recent weeks."" First-class flight Bishop Tebartz-van Elst - and his spending habits - had become infamous in Germany, where many people pay Church tax to the state. The tax raised 5.2bn euros for Catholics and 4.6bn euros for Protestants in 2012. Calls were made for the bishop to resign after he was accused of lying under oath about his spending. He was criticised for a first-class flight to India to visit the poor. But his official residence is at the heart of the criticism, after renovations were originally costed at 5.5m euros. German media are reporting that the residence was fitted with a bath that cost 15,000 euros, a conference table for 25,000 euros and a private chapel that cost 2.9m euros. The story has attracted heavy coverage and has stoked controversy among Catholics. It was in Germany that Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. The BBC's Alan Johnston, in Rome, says all this was bound to play badly with the new Pope, who has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of senior clerics whose lifestyles seem a little too lavish. Pope Francis has also signalled his intention to clean up the Vatican's finances, appointing a commission to advise him on reforms. There is no surprise in Rome that the Vatican has ordered the bishop's suspension from his duties while the spending row is investigated, our correspondent adds. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the daughter of a Protestant pastor, said that she had expressed ""hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church"". In his absence, the bishop's diocese will be administered by Limburg's vicar general, Wolfgang Roesch.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: The ultra runner finding 'lockdown positives',"By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter In 2017, the Inverness athlete was the first Scot to finish the gruelling 350-mile 6633 Ultra marathon above the Arctic Circle. Four years earlier, he completed a marathon in the Sahara Desert. This year he had started his final preparations for a new ultra event being held as part of the Loch Ness 360 Challenge. It was to be his first ultra since 2017's sub-zero 6633 Ultra in Canada, but it has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Riddle, who competed in road race cycling at the 1994 Commonwealth Games and has Type 1 diabetes, has adapted his fitness regime, along with the rest of his life, to the lockdown and social distancing. He has put running on hold for now and is instead marching, completing several miles of the fast-paced walking each day on routes close to home. ""I am lucky that I live on the outskirts of Inverness. I can go out to near the farm where I grew up and not meet a single person,"" he said. ""I can go up a nearby hill and look out over Inverness and towards Fort George. I live in a beautiful part of the country. I take none of it for granted."" The lockdown has given him more time with his family, including his son Alasdair, 16, who has taken an interest in road cycling. Riddle said: ""Alasdair hadn't really been that interested before. He plays football with Inverness Caledonian Thistle's under-18s."" But with no football because of lockdown restrictions, Alasdair has been getting some coaching on road cycling from his dad and is achieving top 10 times for completing Inverness' toughest road race hill climbs. ""He refuses to wear Lycra cycling gear. I have a loft full of Lycra,"" said Riddle, who added: ""He is doing all these hill climbs in baggy football kit."" For the rest of the time in recent weeks Riddle has been doing DIY, joining the family for online quizzes including the popular local Holm Primary School's Thursday evening quiz and has started writing a book about his adventures in cycling and running. ""I think it is right the lockdown remains in place for at least another few weeks to help people to be safe,"" said Riddle. ""I felt proud to be a Scot when the decision was taken not to relax the restrictions now.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
More Bank of England powers to curb housing bubble,"Robert PestonEconomics editor And with signs that there is already overheating in the London housing market, which may be spreading elsewhere, these powers suddenly seem - well - quite useful. But in practice what the FPC can do to curb dangerous lending is perhaps a bit constrained and indirect. So, for example, the governor of the Bank, Mark Carney, has made clear his concerns that some banks are providing mortgages that are too great a multiple of a household's earnings - such that as and when interest rates rise, those mortgages would become unaffordable. Which would be bad news for the borrower, who would be in difficult financial straits, for the bank lender, which might incur losses, and for the economy (if banks collectively incurred such big losses that their capacity to lend was reduced). Right now, the Financial Policy Committee has the ability to recommend to the relevant regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, that they should force banks either to ration high loan-to-income mortgages (by stipulating that they should be a specified low proportion of all mortgages) or to ban very high loan-to-income mortgages. In practice, the regulators would probably do what the FPC asks, but they do have discretion to say no. Tonight therefore the Chancellor is announcing, in his Mansion House Speech, that the FPC is unambiguously the boss of the regulators, by giving it the power to order these curbs on lending, rather than just propose such curbs. This power of instruction would extend as well to loans that are a high proportion of the market value of a house - although such high loan-to-value mortgages do not seem to be today's problem. In other words, the FPC will henceforth unambiguously have the ability to take the heat out of the housing market. We will learn later this month whether it is choosing to employ these powers right now. PS: George Osborne will also make it clear that these powers for the Bank of England to rein in risky mortgage lending will equally apply to mortgages insured by the Treasury's controversial help-to-buy scheme.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russian spy: Skripal case highlights UK's Russia dilemma,"Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter A British public inquiry concluded in 2016 that Russian agents had murdered Litvinenko and that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself ""probably approved"" the operation. Of course, we do not know yet the reason for the Skripals' mystery symptoms. The Russian Embassy in London has denied that their country has had any role. Mr Johnson has insisted that Britain will respond ""robustly"" if evidence of state involvement emerges, describing Russia as ""in many respects a malign and disruptive force"". If Russian involvement is found, the foreign secretary appeared to raise a question mark over England's participation in the World Cup, which will be held in Russia this summer. Though subsequently, British officials were at pains to stress he was referring to official representation rather than a boycott by the football team itself. But his remarks highlight the dilemma facing the UK government in dealing with Moscow. It has few diplomatic levers to pull. Relations are already frosty - a hang-over from the Litvinenko affair, compounded by serious differences over Russian policies in Ukraine and Syria, let alone Russia's more aggressive noises towards Nato countries in central and northern Europe. It is hard to see what further steps might be taken to encourage a shift in policy in the Kremlin and certainly not by the United Kingdom alone. Since the Litvinenko affair, British policy towards Russia has swung back and forth. Relations went into the freezer in the wake of the assassination, with diplomats expelled and intelligence co-operation halted. Distracted by Brexit? David Cameron's government introduced a partial thaw driven by a desire to maximise trade opportunities - perhaps a forerunner of the sorts of concerns that may loom much larger once the UK leaves the European Union. The Ukraine crisis though proved a major set-back with Britain at the forefront of calls for tough economic sanctions against Moscow. The outcome of the public inquiry into the Litvinenko affair only confirmed the government's suspicions of a direct official role in the killing. Progress towards a nuclear deal with Iran, in which Russia played a key role, helped to soften some criticism of the Kremlin, but Moscow's growing military role in Syria and its indiscriminate bombing campaign there worsened tensions again. Now Russia and the United States seem to be engaged in a mini-nuclear arms race again; tensions between Nato and Russia are growing; and the UK is in any case distracted by its plans to withdraw from the EU. Should this latest case raise credible suspicions of a Russian official role, London may struggle to find an effective response. Relations are already bad and everything that was done in response to the Litvinenko affair may have failed to fundamentally alter Russian behaviour.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'No Outsiders' teacher leads Birmingham Pride parade,"Andrew Moffat started the ""No Outsiders"" lessons at Parkfield Community School in the city, which has led to protests by some Muslim parents. Pride organisers said there was ""no-one better"" to lead the parade, which started at midday. Thousands have been expected to attend the annual event, now in its 22nd year. Speaking to BBC News about the invitation to join the Pride parade, Mr Moffat said it was ""absolutely wonderful"". He was joined at the front of the procession by Khakan Qureshi, founder of Birmingham South Asians LGBT and Saima Razzaq, from Supporting Education of Equality and Diversity in Schools (SEEDS). ""It's so important, isn't it, at this time that we are showing that's what Birmingham is like,"" Mr Moffat said. ""It's not about protests outside schools, that's not Birmingham. This is Birmingham. ""They're talking about 80,000 people turning up to support Pride. ""That's Birmingham - supporting diversity and community cohesion."" In 2015, Birmingham Pride awarded a grant of £5,000 to the ""No Outsiders"" programme, which organisers said was an ""incredible initiative"". The ""No Outsiders"" scheme had been running at Parkfield school since 2014. It was formed to educate children about the Equality Act, British values, and diversity, using storybooks to teach children about LGBT relationships, race, religion, adoption and disability. However, some parents with children at the school in Alum Rock raised a petition in January, claiming some of the teaching contradicted Islam. The protests have since spread to Anderton Park Primary in Balsall Heath with a protest held on Friday afternoon outside the school thought to be the biggest so far. Those against the inclusion of LGBT issues in classes have said the content contradicts their Islamic beliefs, and have accused the school of not listening to parents' concerns. But head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said she would ""never stop"" teaching pupils about equality. Festival director Lawrence Barton said Mr Moffat had been asked to lead the parade in light of the ""division which the controversy over 'No Outsiders' lessons has created"".

‘Happiness Fund’ to help pay debts for up to 1.6m Koreans,"The scheme is open to certain Koreans who have struggled to repay debts of less than 10m won ($9,128; £6,826). Eligible people can apply to the government for debt relief from next February. They will be paid in part out of the government's ""National Happiness Fund"", set up to help troubled borrowers. To qualify for the scheme, individuals must prove they earn a monthly income of less than 990,000 won ($910), and show they have struggled to pay back the debt for more than a decade. The plan could clear as much as 6.2 trillion won in bad debts. The country's Financial Services Commission, which will administer the scheme, said the policy was designed to help individuals make a fresh start by relieving their debt burdens. 'Confucian capitalism' The debts will be written-off in part through funds sourced from other lenders, and through the National Happiness Fund. The Happiness Fund was established in 2013 to help the poorest Koreans manage their debt. The scheme was a key campaign pledge of the former South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, who vowed to tackle growing inequality in the country. Since it was founded, the fund has provided 6.8 trillion won in debt restructuring. Jasper Kim, chief executive of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, described the latest plan to clear private debts for poorer Koreans as a ""good move"". ""It is a unique form of Confucian capitalism, whereby the state is often viewed as a patriarchal protector of the people,"" Mr Kim said. He said household debt was a significant issue in South Korea. But Mr Kim added the scheme ""does not directly address the higher levels of individual debt incurred by middle and higher-income households"", which may be more of a concern for policymakers. It comes amid signs of growing strength in the South Korea's economy, Asia's fourth largest. The country's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than six years on Thursday, removing emergency stimulus in place since 2012 to boost the economy. The government expects the economy to expand by more than 3% this year, up from the 2.8% average growth rate for the past five years.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Council gym membership 'too costly',"Annual prices have gone up by £100 at two-thirds of public gyms since 2010, a survey of 95 English councils found. Prices of evening fitness classes have also risen at almost every local authority centre and now average £5.95 per visit. Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger said it was a ""real risk"" to tackling obesity. 'New Year's Resolutions' The Labour research found a yearly gym pass now costs £368 on average, an increase of £15 since 2010. It also found that 48 councils had introduced above-average hikes, including a £91.50 increase by Wealden District Council and a £80.50 rise by Hastings Borough Council. Ms Berger said it could impact on millions of people across the country who wanted to kick-start 2014 by getting fitter and more active. ""There is a real risk, however, that many people will be put off from keeping to their new year's resolutions by soaring gym charges and David Cameron's failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis,"" she said. ""With worrying obesity levels and stagnating physical activity levels, we desperately need ministers to make gym and leisure facilities accessible and affordable for all."" Shadow sports minister Clive Efford said individual council bosses were not to blame. ""Sadly, councils are either forced to increase charges or cut services all together,"" the Labour MP told the Daily Mirror. ""This will make it harder for people on low incomes to access leisure facilities and these people already use these services in the lowest numbers."" A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was ""committed"" to helping people lead ""longer, healthier lives"". ""For the first time ever, we've given local authorities ring-fenced budgets to tackle public health issues in their local area,"" they said. ""Councils can then decide how to spend this funding to help local people lead fit and active lives."" A spokeswoman for Freedom Leisure, which operates 35 leisure centres in partnership with 11 local authorities, including Wealden District Council, said that while they have had to increase prices due to the ""massive costs"" involved in running leisure centres, they were ""sensitive"" to the situations of individual members and offered discounts for 14 to 18-year-olds, OAPs and people on benefits. ""We review our prices annually taking a range of factors into consideration,"" she said. ""Increasingly high running costs have to be taken into account but as a not-for-profit trust our goal is to be able to invest in community leisure provision year on year and we set financial targets accordingly. ""We also take a close look at the economy, both nationally and local to each centre, to ensure we are able to offer affordable leisure facilities for all our communities. We review each membership category separately rather that issuing increases 'across the board'."" The Local Government Association (LGA) said that individual councils were responsible for setting their own budgets for local gyms.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China bans Tiananmen Square-related web search terms,"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News Terms such as ""six four"", ""23"", ""candle"" and ""never forget"", typed in Chinese search engines, do not return any information about the event. Discussions of the unrest of 4 June 1989 remain taboo in the country. But some users managed to upload a few pictures on to Twitter-like Sina Weibo. In 1989, troops shot dead hundreds of pro-democracy protesters gathered in central Beijing. The demonstrations have never been publicly marked in China, and the government has never said how many were killed. But human rights groups' estimates range from several hundred to several thousand killed. Analysts say that censoring any online talk related to the event is especially important for Beijing this year, as the government gets ready for a leadership handover. No candles ""Today's anniversary is one of those 'red line' topics that are always subject to a high degree of scrutiny,"" Duncan Clark of BDA China told the BBC. ""Typical search results for Chinese search engines of Tiananmen Square return bland descriptions of the square, photos of tourists or the main landmarks, and so on. ""And some are tweeting that the characters for 'today' are today banned."" China's main microblogging platform, Sina Weibo, has deactivated the candle emoticon, commonly adopted on the web to mourn deaths. After users responded by trying to replace the banned candle emoticon with the Olympic flame symbol, the website deactivated it too. When trying to search for the unrest, users have been coming across a message explaining that search results could not be displayed ""due to relevant laws, regulations and policies"". Throughout the years, the government's methods have been very effective in making people avoid any discussions of the crackdown, added Mr Clark. ""For most Chinese the words 'Tiananmen Square' don't bring to mind the same images and associations as in the West, it's more like Trafalgar Square to Brits. ""This speaks to the efficacy of government controls - many born in that year or after have never heard of what happened, even well-educated university graduates."" 'Sensitive' terms The US government has urged China to free all those still in prison after the crackdown. The US State Department message also called on China to ""provide a full public accounting of those killed, detained or missing"". Besides the 1989 unrest at Tiananmen Square, the Chinese authorities censor search terms on the internet that relate to the independence movement in Taiwan, or sensitive postings relating to Tibet, Xinjiang or Communist Party rule. Although Google search is not banned in China, people using it are routed to the engine's servers based in Hong Kong. Google in Hong Kong has recently added a new feature indicating to users as they type, in real time, which words are ""sensitive"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mali coup: Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta flies to UAE,"Mr Keïta, 75, flew to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday for medical treatment after suffering a minor stroke, military officials said. The junta is currently in talks with opposition and civil society groups about a transition to civilian rule. It says it will step down in two years, but West African leaders want a quicker transfer of power. Mr Keïta was overthrown on 18 August following mass protests against his rule over corruption, the mismanagement of the economy and a dispute over legislative elections. The coup sparked international condemnation, but it was welcomed by many Malians. Mr Keïta was detained by the military, but later freed. 'Regional deal over departure' On Thursday, he left a hospital in the capital, Bamako, after a two-day stay during which he was treated for a minor stroke, AFP news agency reported. His former chief of staff said he could be away for up to15 days. Mr Keïta left for the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi, after representatives of the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), and the United Nations (UN) held talks with the coup leaders, BBC West Africa reporter Seydina Alioune Djigo says. Ecowas gave an undertaking to the junta that Mr Keïta would return if he is wanted for any crimes allegedly committed during his seven-year rule, our reporter adds. It is the fourth coup in the West African state since it gained independence from France in 1960. A coup in 2012 led to militant Islamists exploiting the instability to seize territory in northern Mali. French troops helped regain territory, but attacks continue. On Saturday, two French soldiers fighting the militants in northern Mali were killed and a third was wounded after a roadside bomb destroyed their armoured vehicle. In paying tribute to the soldiers, French President Emmanuel Macron repeated his call for a swift transition to civilian rule in Mali. More about Mali's battle against jihadis The coup leaders have promised to respect international agreements on fighting jihadists.

Women's football: Girl 'a champion' against sexism,"Darcie, 13, from Cwmbran in Torfaen, has been called a ""lesbian"" because she wants to play football professionally. She was also told she could not play football in PE in school and has to play hockey and netball instead. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) praised her for speaking out and said it is reviewing football in schools. On Wednesday, Darcie was given the opportunity to train with the Wales Women's National team in Newport and talk about her experiences in playing football. Caroline Spanton, head of football development for the FAW Trust, said Darcie spoke out ""bravely"" against criticism and her example could lead to change in the way girls access football in school. ""One of the big things we're looking at is actually using young people like Darcie to be our activists - they're the young people who will change gender stereotyping issues,"" she said. ""We are aware that Darcie's case isn't an isolated case. We know that there's a real want and demand for girls to play more football, particularly in schools, so we're reviewing the challenges and barriers girls are facing within schools to make sure we are creating more opportunities. ""We need to make a change. Football has that opportunity and we're not just talking about football, we're talking about society issues and gender stereotypes and I think we can use the power of football to help showcase that young girls do have a voice."" 'Not for girls' Darcie's experiences have been echoed by parents from across the UK. Jason, from Scotland, said his nine-year-old daughter does not play football at school anymore, despite playing for her local club. He said that she used to play during break time, but comments from boys have put her off and staff do not know the rules of the game, so cannot assess if the game is being played fairly. ""It's made her feel sad about school,"" he explained, and added the school needed to challenge bad behaviour. But he said the football club his daughter plays for is ""excellent"" and has ""outstanding support from the main [professional male] club"". Chris, who lives in London, said his 10-year-old daughter had ""no issues"" with playing football at school and finds other sports ""boring"". Another parent, who chose not to give their name, said their daughter was banned from taking part in a tournament because she is a girl. They explained that she was selected to play for the school team, but was told the day before she could not take part as county rules stated the tournament was for boys only. Her parent said that there is no female football team at the school, and when a football skills demonstration was held at the school only boys were chosen to attend. They added: ""She is obstructed from joining in with football in break times by the boys as the message from the school is that it is not for girls.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Swansea City's Brendan Rodgers climbs Kilimanjaro,"Rodgers dedicated his climb to his late mother Christina who died last year, and father Malachy, who has cancer. The Premier League's newest boss was raising money for a cancer charity as part of a 17-strong team representing the Football League. BBC Sport's Mark Clemmit and Sky pundit Chris Kamara were among the climbers. ""This has been one of the most stressed physical and mental experiences of my entire life,"" said Rodgers. ""But it has been a wonderful team effort to get to the summit. ""Ninety per cent of the group reached the summit, an amazing achievement when you consider that only 45% of people who attempt it actually do it. ""I'm overwhelmed that I've done the double this season and this is dedicated to my mum, dad and all my family, friends and Swans fans that have supported me."" Rodgers had little time to celebrate guiding Swansea into the Premier League for the first time following the 4-2 win over Reading in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on 30 May. He was soon making his way to the foot of Africa's highest mountain, hoping to successfully climb 19,341ft to the summit. And after a gruelling five days of trekking, the team set off at midnight on Tuesday to make the final six hour ascent. Fantastic The group, led by Sky Sports pundit Chris Kamara and known as Team Kammy, stood watching the sunrise over the spectacular views of the savannah plains. They all donned their club colours to bring The Football League to Africa's highest peak. Northern Ireland-born Rodgers' target was to raise £2,000 from the climb but that figures stands at almost £12,000 The overall target was to raise £500,000 to help provide 25,000 hours of free nursing care for people in their own homes. So far the team has raised more than £150,000. John Nagle, head of communications for the Football League, said: ""For the group to conquer Africa's highest mountain and raise so much money in the process has been a fantastic way for us to crown The Football League's season of support for Marie Curie Cancer Care. ""We offer our congratulations to all those that have taken part.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Colour-coded school performance ratings revealed in Wales,"The 238 best performing schools have been rated green, while 81 schools have been rated ""red"" for needing the most improvement. The education minister said there is ""no hiding place"" under the replacement for the controversial school banding. But one teaching union said the change would ""anger many schools"". The headline figures in the report show: Education Minister Huw Lewis said it was time to ""wake up"" for anyone who did not think he was serious about raising standards. 'Hard work' ""My interest is in learners achieving their full potential, rather than vested interests in the system,"" he said. Unions had criticised the banding system - which was introduced just over three years ago - as a failure and for being volatile, with schools able to leap from the lowest band five, to the highest band one, in only one year. The decision to scrap them was made last September. The Welsh government believe it will help both primary and secondary schools improve by judging them over a three year period rather than just one. But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) accused the minister of a lack of consultation and ""unilaterally changing"" the basic rules for judging standards in secondary schools at the last moment. Acting NAHT Cymru director Dr Chris Howard said: ""The new school categorisation system will anger many schools in Wales at a time when the minister should be recognising the hard work that's been done to raise standards. ""It will do nothing to encourage schools and teachers working with the most challenging communities."" The union said the new system was ""very little better"" than banding and it ensured half the schools in Wales would be classed as sub-standard even before a lesson had been taught. They said it encouraged schools to exclude pupils with poor behaviour and low levels of academic achievement. 'No apology' It is also concerned it ""unfairly penalises"" schools which have more pupils who are entitled to free school meals. Dr Howard added: ""The categorisation system was supposed to show which schools needed most help. It will not be seen that way. It will stigmatise schools and the professionals in them."" But Mr Lewis said: ""Under this system, there is no hiding place for schools that don't deliver for the most disadvantaged pupils. ""We have deliberately set a high bar - I make no apology for that."" And he countered union criticism by saying that achievements by free school meal students were ""simply not good enough"". He added: ""Under the new system you don't get to call yourself a top performing school, unless the results of your poorest pupils reach a certain basic standard. ""If there are those who seriously want to argue with the basic fairness of that, then good luck to them.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Coping with behavioural issues during lockdown,"Abbie, from Suffolk, has five boys under the age of 16, some of whom have special educational needs. She was herself diagnosed with Asperger syndrome several years ago. ""I have no choice with my family but I am very strong-willed,"" she said. ""I am a fighter."" She said the announcement of lockdown in March ""put panic in me"", although she has managed to keep the boys in school ""to maintain routine and a sense of balance"". She said sometimes behaviour could be ""unpredictable"", ""hard to manage"" and could get very ""serious"", but also that one of her sons was ""the most loving, cuddly, clever little boy"". Her own personal diagnosis has helped her relate to her children's needs, she added. ""I like to be in control - which I know sometimes comes across as control over everything - but it's not, it's just the reins of my life. ""I can be very literal and precise - I have to know the ins and outs of everything and I can't settle unless I do. ""But routine is everything. Changes can cause meltdowns. ""During this process I've had to learn to cope - and to reflect."" Weekly visits to a close friend and family have become video calls - or waves through windows. But her love of exercise as stress relief has gone from three classes a week - to none. She said her greatest fear at the moment was how the children would cope ""when this is all over"" - and the routine changed again. ""I find it hard to imagine that there are other families out there like this. But we can't be the only one this size and with this many issues. ""I think to myself - this is a test. It's just a test for all of us. And I want to pass it."" 'There is support' Annie Clements, of the Suffolk charity Autism and ADHD, says Abbie's story is unusual because of her personal diagnosis, but she is not alone. The charity supports the families of thousands of children with complex behavioural needs. ""Being a parent to a child with special educational needs is challenging, firstly understanding your child and then fighting the system to get them the best education and financial support,"" she said. ""Lockdown will have devastating effects on some families: anxiety, money, disruption to the normal routine. Their relationships, with each other, with school, can shift - the sense of being restrained. ""Often we don't realise there is support out there until we need it. That's when we 'see' each other"".

Abdul Fattah al-Sisi: Egyptian president may rule until 2034,"Mr Sisi is due to stand down in 2022 when his second four-year term ends. But 485 of the country's 596 lawmakers voted on Thursday to lengthen presidential terms to six years and let Mr al-Sisi serve another two. Several Egyptian human rights groups have spoken out against the decision. The changes, first proposed earlier this month, will now be drafted into legislation and put to another parliamentary vote. If approved again, Egypt will then hold a referendum. What are the changes? Article 140 of Egypt's constitution, approved in a referendum in 2014, currently states that the president serves four-year terms and may only be re-elected once. But under proposed changes, the 64-year-old leader would be allowed to stay in power until 2034. He would also get new powers to appoint judges and the public prosecutor. The changes would also give Egypt's military broad powers to ""[safeguard] the constitution."" Other amendments included the introduction of a second parliamentary chamber, a 25% quota for women in parliament and ""appropriate representation"" for minority Coptic Christians, young people and those with disabilities. How are people reacting? President Sisi's supporters in parliament argue the longer term limits are needed to allow him more time to complete economic reforms and development projects. But his critics fear it is an attempt to further entrench his rule in the country. Eleven Egyptian human rights groups, in a joint statement, said the provisions were ""disingenuous attempts to sugarcoat [the government's] authoritarian power-grab"". Signatories include the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies and the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. Lawmakers have also spoken out against the vote. ""We are placing absolute powers in the hands of one person... at a time when the people were expecting us to give them 'bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity',"" Ahmed Tantawi, an opposition MP, said on Wednesday, using the slogan of the 2011 uprising that overthrew then-President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Sisi, a former army chief, led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013 following protests against his rule. Since then, he has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, leading to the detention of tens of thousands of people. Mr Sisi recently denied detaining any political prisoners. The president has also led a military campaign against Islamic State militants in the country's Sinai Peninsula. He was re-elected last April after winning 97% of the vote, facing no serious competition because several rivals dropped out or were arrested.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde sends obese to Weight Watchers,"By Eleanor BradfordBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The NHS will pay Weight Watchers' membership costs as part of a two-year pilot scheme. Some working in weight-loss management within the NHS have criticised the move as an example of privatisation. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) said the Weight Watchers model was ""one which works"". A statement from the health board said: ""Following a full tendering process we have awarded a contract to Weight Watchers to provide community-based weight management services as part of a two-year pilot project. ""People identify with Weight Watchers and evidence shows that their model is one which works. We will carry out a full evaluation of this work at the end of the pilot in two years."" The largest study so far of a commercial weight-loss programme found that one third of almost 30,000 people who were referred to Weight Watchers lost 5% or more of their bodyweight. Weight loss of 5% or above is associated with health benefits. However, Glasgow already has its own NHS weight-loss programme which has published successful results. A third of those attending the NHS programme lost at least two stone (12.7kg) and kept it off for a year. NHSGGC said the Weight Watchers programme was in addition to other ""hospital-based"" weight-management services. The exact value of the contract with Weight Watchers is commercially sensitive but NHGGC said it was less than £150,000 a year. Weight Watchers said that, in addition to NHSGGC, it was also currently working with NHS Grampian and NHS Tayside. 'Hospital-based service' Zoe Griffiths, head of programme and public health for Weight Watchers UK, said: ""Weight Watchers has been supporting local health bodies and providing successful weight management on referral services since 2005, and has worked with over 100 public health and NHS organisations across the UK. ""With the Scottish Health Survey reporting a significant increase in the proportion of adults who are obese (from 17.2% in 1995 to 26.1% in 2012), Weight Watchers recognises the importance of delivering services to help people to manage their weight and are committed to supporting and motivating people to change their lifestyles for good."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""NHS Scotland does not promote competition and makes very limited use of the private sector to provide targeted services. ""The most recent figures show that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spending in the private sector for services has fallen in recent years and stands 0.8% of their frontline budget, and is projected to fall further. ""NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are working with Weight Watchers on a community-based pilot project, which will be in addition to their existing hospital-based weight management service, this is part of their efforts to support people to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grenfell Tower fire: Downing Street criticises council over aborted meeting,"The cabinet had tried to hold Thursday's meeting behind closed doors but was forced by a court order to hold it in public. A spokesman said Number 10 expected the council to ""respect"" the court ruling. Separately, the chief executive of the organisation which manages Grenfell Tower has agreed to ""step aside"". Kensington and Chelsea Council leaders abruptly ended their meeting after 20 minutes, claiming an open meeting would ""prejudice"" the forthcoming public inquiry. On Thursday appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to lead the public inquiry into the deaths of at least 80 people. 'Hiding from residents' Angry protests followed after the abandoned meeting, which Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, whose ward includes Grenfell Tower, branded a ""fiasco"". He shouted: ""An absolute fiasco, this is why I am calling for your resignation."" Mr Atkinson, the Labour group leader on Kensington and Chelsea Council, told the BBC he was ""ashamed"" of the authority. He accused the leaders of ""hiding from residents, they have been hiding from backbench councillors for over a week"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has demanded the resignation of the entire council leadership. The Labour mayor said the council's decision to scrap the meeting ""beggars belief"". And Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour's shadow communities and local government secretary, called for ""commissioners to take control"" of Kensington and Chelsea ""if necessary"". While he welcomed the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid's call for the democratic process to be open and transparent in the wake of Thursday night's abandoned meeting, he also called on him to ""immediately ensure that all residents who are now homeless or in temporary accommodation are getting the support they need"". Before the meeting, Mr Paget-Brown apologised for the authority's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, in which at least 80 people died.. The Conservative councillor told BBC London he would not resign in the foreseeable future. On 22 June, the chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Council Nicholas Holgate announced he was resigning following pressure from Mr Javid. A statement from Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) confirmed its chief executive Robert Black had also resigned so he can ""concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry"". In a statement released after the cabinet meeting was adjourned, Mr Paget-Brown said: ""We are under sustained media criticism for a slow reaction to the fire, non-visibility and for failing to invest in north Kensington. ""I believe that many of these criticisms need to be challenged and over time they will be, but I can think of nothing more demeaning to the memory of those lost and missing in the fire than seeking the resolution of political scores.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Margaret Thatcher's criticism of Brixton riot response revealed,"Lord Scarman led a five-month inquiry into the unrest in south London. The files, released by the National Archives, cover the period after the Scarman Report's publication in 1981. A handwritten note by Mrs Thatcher on a summary of the report reads: ""I'm afraid the report seems highly critical of the police."" The home secretary at the time, Willie Whitelaw, presented it to the Commons in a statement on 25 November 1981. At the time it was positively received by a cross-section of MPs from different parties. The rioting which erupted in Brixton, in the south London borough of Lambeth, shocked the nation. For three days, rioters - predominantly young, black men - fought police, attacked buildings and set fire to vehicles. Tensions in the area had been heightened early that April by Operation Swamp - an attempt to cut street crime in Brixton which used the controversial ""Sus law"" to stop and search more than 1,000 people in six days. More than 300 people were injured in the riots and the damage caused came to an estimated value of £7.5m. The public was shocked by the unexpectedness of events, because it seemed to many at the time that black people were well integrated into the fabric of UK society. Mr Whitelaw described Lord Scarman's recommendations as ""a statement of philosophy and direction for the future"", adding: ""I accept and endorse this statement of philosophy."" Mr Whitelaw paid particular attention to - in his words - ""the need to develop formal arrangements in every police force area for consultation between police and community"". 'Very worried' Less than a year later, in June 1982, Lady Thatcher received a briefing telling her of the home secretary's intention to introduce a statutory duty on police to consult the community. This would have the advantage, the Home Office note said, of ""increasing the flow of information between the Police and the community which Scarman felt to be essential"". Lady Thatcher wrote in response: ""I confess to being very worried about this. ""It will soon be said that the police cannot prosecute or search without consultation. I cannot see what they are going to be compelled to consult about."" Her government later made arrangements for community consultation as part of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, after Willie Whitelaw had been replaced as home secretary.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Flood-hit Tewkesbury farmer 'unable to plant crops',"Ben Perry from Tewkesbury said because of the wet autumn the only crop he had been able to plant was oilseed rape. The oilseed rape has been under water for the past two weeks. Mr Perry said it was ""catastrophic emotionally and financially,"" as he usually makes £15,000 in profits from his wheat, barley and oat winter crops. He said the weather since September had been ""too wet"" for planting and he was aware winter crops planted by other farmers ""had not established"". ""It's not just profit wise, it's soil structure that's damaged,"" he said. ""The biology in our soil is damaged and it's going to take a lot of expense, patience and attention to detail to get us back in a position where everything is back to square one."" Oilseed rape was planted in September but has been under five feet (approx 1.5m) of water for the past two weeks, and is set to remain so for the next month. According to government rules, Mr Perry is ineligible to apply for government rebates until the land has been flooded for a month. Mr Perry said a spring crop probably was not possible either as the ground in other parts of his 250 acre-land was too wet for planting. Winter flooding and the wet autumn has created a national problem for farmers around the country and some winter crops such as barley have not been planted. The National Farmers Union (NFU) is calling on the government to rethink its approach to flooding, The Tenants' Farmers Association is also calling on landowners to reduce rents to help farmers cope with their losses. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We understand the difficulties farmers are facing due to the prolonged wet period over the last five months. ""The government is investing £2.6bn to better protect 300,000 homes by 2021, and this is expected to include 700,000 acres of agricultural land helping avoid £1.5bn of economic damage. ""Defra is currently working with the Environment Agency to collect data which will be used to determine the impacts of storms Ciara and Dennis to agricultural land before any further decisions on the Farming Recovery Fund can be taken.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Preston Bus Station: £1 bid set to be declined,"Entrepreneur Simon Rigby offered to buy the iconic bus station after Preston Council voted to demolish it because of running and refurbishing costs. His plans were backed by a consortium of local experts. A council report has recommended the cabinet declines the proposal and works with Lancashire County Council to build a new bus station at the site. It said Mr Rigby's plans were not in the best, long term interests of taxpayers. 'Modern standards' Preston City Council will meet on 21 March to formally consider the proposal. Council Leader Peter Rankin said: ""Selling the bus station for £1 might save the council money in the short term but it guarantees nothing. ""There can be no guarantees imposed on the future use of the building as a bus station, nor on future investment in the building. ""The major risk is that, for whatever reason, anyone who owns the bus station building could at some point simply decide not to operate it as a bus station anymore. That would leave Preston without a functioning bus station and no money or land to build a new one."" He said the cost of getting the bus station up to ""modern day standards"" were between £17m and £23m. 'Bus station lover' Mr Rigby, who founded utilities company Spice and is now CEO of the Greengen Group, said he wanted to save the bus station as he knows what it means to local people. He was proposing to invest up to £2m to pay for some repairs and improvements to the building. His plans included making the car parking spaces larger for fewer cars, banning traffic from part of the bus station area to benefit pedestrians and setting up a retail area for start-up businesses. Mr Rankin said: ""We would like to thank Simon for his proposal and the time he has taken to put it together and discuss it with us. ""He like many people is a lover of the bus station building and wants to keep it. ""However, we have to think long term and what's in the best interests of Preston. ""The £8.3m guaranteed investment from Lancashire County Council, set aside in their capital programme for a new bus station for Preston appears to be the best option.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
EU immigration - the Croatian solution?,"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Sources stress that no final decisions have yet been made on what the specific measures will be, how they will be announced (ie whether in a speech or an article or an interview) or when they'll be made (ie before or after the Rochester by-election). Yesterday's Sunday Times story about a possible limit to the number of national insurance numbers issued to new arrivals from the EU is said to draw on current practice in Croatia - the latest country to join the EU. British workers wanting to live and work in Croatia for more than three months need a work permit which - according to one website - requires: These requirements also apply to citizens of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain who have also applied so-called transitional controls limiting free movement for the first seven years of Croatia's EU membership - up until 2020. It is unclear how or whether this regime could be applied to an existing member state though, perhaps, it suggests that it could be possible provided the restrictions work in both directions. This is just one of a number of options being considered, I'm told. Last week another possibility emerged - a so-called ""emergency brake"" mechanism which would allow a country to stop migration after it reached a certain level. This has never previously been used to stop immigration and EU officials are fond of pointing out that at the same time as immigration levels to the UK are high unemployment levels are much lower than other EU countries - suggesting, they argue, that there is no evidence that immigrants take the jobs of UK workers. Several countries - German, Austria and the Netherlands - have already agreed to the desirability of limiting benefit payments to the families of migrants and changing the so-called transitional arrangements which apply when countries join the EU. However, as yet, there is no sign of any other country wanting limits to the total numbers allowed to move from one EU country to another. There is some frustration amongst the prime minister's advisers that ideas are leaking out before they have had proper time to assess them. That, of course, is the problem with simultaneously trying to solve a political problem - the rise of UKIP - by talking up how tough you'll be in Europe at the same time as considering whether any of your promises will be agreed to by 27 other EU countries.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Uber agrees to 20 years of privacy audits to settle FTC charges,"It also had to agree to have the effectiveness of the stricter controls assessed by an independent auditor every two years for the next 20 years. The charges relate to God View, a software program that enabled the ride-sharing company to monitor real-time locations of customers and drivers. Uber faces fines if it fails to comply. The US Federal Trade Commission began investigating Uber following allegations about the God View program in the media in 2014. After the investigation started, Uber developed an automated system for monitoring employee access to customer and driver personal data. However, the FTC said the company had stopped using it eight months after it had been put in place. Concerns were also raised over a 2015 breach that exposed personal data about more than 100,000 Uber drivers. ""Uber failed consumers in two key ways: first by misrepresenting the extent to which it monitored its employees' access to personal information about users and drivers, and second by misrepresenting that it took reasonable steps to secure that data,"" said FTC acting chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who presided over the settlement. ""Our order requires a culture of privacy sensitivity for Uber. ""It is going to make them take privacy into account every day."" Uber said it was pleased that the FTC investigation had ended. ""We have significantly strengthened our privacy and data security practices since then and will continue to invest heavily in these programmes,"" an Uber representative said. Comparitech security researcher Lee Munson said: ""While such an agreement with the FTC may sound incredibly arduous, Uber will probably benefit from a necessary change in approach which will stand it in good stead for the incoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, which threatens stiff penalties for companies that are lax with employee and customer data."" Fines and lawsuits Apart from the FTC investigation, Uber was also sued by the New York attorney general over the God View allegations. And, in January 2016, Uber agreed to encrypt all rider geo-location data, as well as to pay a penalty of $20m (£16m) to settle concerns over how it had handled the data breach. One year later, the FTC ordered Uber to pay a further $20m over claims the company had misled drivers about the potential income they could earn. Separately, Uber's former forensic investigator Ward Spangenberg has been suing the company over alleged age discrimination and whistleblower retaliation. In a court declaration from December 2016, Mr Spangenberg alleged that Uber had let its employees spy on celebrities and ex-partners.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Venezuela's Maduro 'optimistic' as crisis talks resume,"The two sides have been engaged in a bitter power struggle since January and preliminary talks held in May in Oslo petered out without an agreement. Mr Maduro said a six-point agenda was being discussed at the meeting which is being hosted by Barbados. He did not give further details. What is known about the talks? The Norwegian foreign ministry is again acting as a mediator, as it did at the previous meeting in Oslo, but has so far onlycommented to confirm the meeting was taking place. Mr Maduro revealed that Monday's meeting lasted five hours. He also said he thought ""a path to peace"" could be found. Juan Guaidó, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, laid out the opposition's aim on Twitter on Sunday. The statement [in Spanish] said the goal was to ""negotiate a way out from the dictatorship"". The roadmap the opposition proposes consists of three points: What's the background? Mr Guaidó and President Maduro have been at loggerheads since January, when the former invoked the constitution and declared himself interim president, arguing that the elections which had returned Mr Maduro to power for a second term in 2018 had not been free and fair. Since then, more than 50 countries, including the United States and most nations in Latin America, have recognised Mr Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate leader. But Venezuela's military - a powerful force in the country - and influential allies such as China and Russia have stuck by Mr Maduro. An attempt by Mr Guaidó to get the military to switch allegiance to him failed, and the country remains in limbo with both men claiming to be the legitimate president. Meanwhile, a severe economic crisis has exacerbated and shortages of food and medicines have grown even more acute. United Nations figures suggest four million people have fled the country since 2015. The government blames the shortages on US sanctions but the opposition says they are down to years of mismanagement. Why are the talks controversial? Just a week ago Mr Guaidó ruled out a return to negotiations, citing as a reason the death in custody of an army captain whose body showed signs of torture. Mr Guaidó has not said why his stance has changed. Some in the opposition say the talks are a ruse by the government to buy itself more time in power. Previous negotiations have broken down without an agreement and some in the opposition say the government's crackdown on rival politicians - with more than a dozen opposition lawmakers being stripped of their parliamentary immunity and others being detained - shows President Maduro has no real interest in negotiating. A United Nations report released on Friday said the Venezuelan government was using a strategy of instilling fear in its population to retain power. The Venezuelan government responded by saying the UN report was one-sided and biased.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Benefit sanctions force people to sleep rough, claims charity","By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter The study, based on research from Sheffield Hallam University, claims that 21% of people sanctioned in the last year became homeless as a result. In addition, 16% of those sanctioned were forced to sleep rough. The government said the report was ""misleading"" and contained ""inaccuracies"". It has already announced a trial scheme to soften the impact of sanctions, particularly for those who have nowhere to live. Under the sanctions regime, claimants have payments stopped if they fail to turn up to job centre appointments. The system has already been heavily criticised, not least by a committee of MPs, who have twice called for an enquiry. In March this year the Work and Pensions Committee said sanctions were causing ""severe hardship"". 'Staggering' impact Sheffield Hallam University questioned 1,013 homeless people from 21 cities, and found that 213 of them had had payments stopped within the last year. Of those claimants, 45 - or 21%- said they became homeless as a result of the sanctions, while 77% said they had gone hungry. ""Findings in these 21 cities demonstrate the potentially devastating effect of benefit sanctions, leading to more people on the streets and going hungry,"" said the report's author, Dr Kesia Reeve of Sheffield Hallam University. ""The impact on people's mental health and job opportunities is staggering."" The report recommends: Sanctions halved But the government disputed the findings. A spokesman said: ""Homelessness is a highly complex issue, and our priority is to ensure that those individuals affected get the right support. ""We know that the most important thing for homeless people is to get a roof over their head. ""This is why we make allowances - for example, we don't expect them to be looking for work while they are focused on finding living arrangements. ""This means that it is highly unlikely that any homeless person would be sanctioned."" In October, the government announced a trial ""yellow card"" system which will give claimants a warning that sanctions are being considered. 'Vulnerable' They will then have two weeks to show why payments should continue. The scheme is not expected to start before the end of 2016. In addition, the government is considering classifying homeless people - and those with mental health conditions - as ""vulnerable"". This would enable them to apply for immediate hardship payments, alongside other vulnerable groups, such as those with children. The number of people being sanctioned has fallen significantly over the last year. Those having Job Seekers Allowance payments stopped has halved from 52,919 in June 2014, to 26,939 a year later. Employment and Support Allowance sanctions have fallen from 3,113 in June 2014, to 1,852 in 2015. Crisis said the government's planned changes still did not go far enough.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
G8 summit: exclusion zone extended in County Fermanagh,"Ribs, speedboats and a tug boat repainted with blue and yellow police livery are being used to secure the approaches to the venue by water. Eight world leaders are due to attend the summit on Monday and Tuesday. Police have warned of potential delays around the airports and in Enniskillen. The lough restrictions, which came into force at lunchtime on Sunday, will remain in place until Tuesday night. 'Lock-down' Boats cannot enter lower Lough Erne from Enniskillen at Portora lock, with the exclusion zone extending north of the summit venue to an area adjacent to Ross Point. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is patrolling the water and its officers have been joined by several police boats and crews from across the UK. In a statement, the PSNI said ""no form of boat or vessel movement will be permitted within the closure zone, but shoreline activity like land-based fishing will be permitted"". BBC reporter in the area, Julian Fowler, said: ""The lock-down on the lough is now in force."" ""The police are out in large numbers but so far, only a handful of protesters have arrived in town, with four tents pitched close to Enniskillen Castle."" Speaking from Enniskillen, ahead of the summit, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, praised the government's decision to host the G8 in County Fermanagh. 'Unthinkable' ""The reason David Cameron decided to bring the G8 to Northern Ireland is because he wanted to show off to the world what a beautiful place it is and how much progress has been made since the political settlement here. ""A few years ago it would have been unthinkable to bring a massive operation like the G8 to County Fermanagh. The fact that it is now happening is a demonstration of the new Northern Ireland,"" she said. World hunger The Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, is the first of the G8 leaders to arrive on the island of Ireland ahead of the summit. Mr Harper is due to meet the Irish Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, in Dublin later on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, hosted a church service as part of the IF campaign to end world hunger, in St Macartin's Cathedral in Enniskillen on Sunday afternoon. Dr Sentamu sent out a strong message on the issue of tax and said that if there was a halt to major companies avoiding taxes, ""millions of people could free themselves from hunger"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tom Ballard: 'Silhouettes' spotted in missing climber search,"Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat in Pakistan at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m), 11 days ago. The search has resumed despite reports the men were ""assumed to be dead"" following a ""huge avalanche"". Earlier, Spanish climber Alex Txikon saw the two ""shapes"" on the Mummery Spur trail that the men had taken. According to Mr Nardi's Facebook page, which is updated by his support team, Mr Txikon identified ""two silhouettes"" on the mountain from the base camp early on Thursday. A Pakistani army helicopter was due to investigate them further, but they were diverted for military purposes, according to Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. Mr Pontecorvo, who had earlier denied reports the search had ended, said it was a ""possibility"" the shapes are the two men. He has told the BBC that a helicopter search will probably resume on Friday. On Wednesday, Karrar Haidri, from Pakistan's Alpine Club, said it had been a ""painful decision"" to end the search. However, Mr Pontecorvo strongly denied the rescue was over. He said: ""Until they tell me that there is no scope to continue I'd say that together with the family I'd encourage them to go forward. ""If we come to a point in which everything possible has been done and nothing has been found, at that point it will be up to the families - although advised by us - to call it off. We're not there yet."" Analysis: BBC World Affairs reporter Richard Galpin The rescue team in Pakistan is expected to make another attempt to scour the mountain for any trace of them. The two climbers went missing 11 days ago on what's known as the Killer Mountain and nothing has been heard from them since. The rescue mission was expected to finish on Wednesday and the base camp was dismantled. But members of the rescue team are now due to be taken high up the mountain by helicopter to look at areas they'd not searched previously. The BBC's been told they will take high resolution photographs and video which can then be analysed. The team leader, a Spanish climber, is to leave the area soon to return to his winter expedition on K2. Mr Ballard, originally from Belper in Derbyshire, is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died descending from the summit of K2 in 1995 - the same year she became the first woman to conquer Everest unaided. Ahead of her death, he had moved to Fort William in Lochaber in the Scottish Highlands with his sister Kate and father Jim. Last week, experienced Pakistani mountaineer Ali Sadpara, who was in an army helicopter, announced seeing a tent ""invaded by snow"" and ""traces of an avalanche"".

Toppled Pontfadog Oak in Chirk moved off house,"Most of the Pontfadog Oak near Chirk, which legend says was a meeting point for a medieval Welsh prince, has been moved about 60m away into a field. But its huge trunk which had a girth of 42ft 5in (12.9m) is still in place. House and land owners Huw and Dianne Williams hope some kind of permanent memorial can be forged out of it. ""It's just a relief and a bit sad at the same time to see it go,"" said Mrs Williams. She said a corner of the roof had been bashed by the tree when it collapsed in high winds in April, but they had now got to get builders and engineers to take a look at the damage. They have lived at the property for 12 years but the house had been in her husband's family for generations and the oak was a famous tree in the valley, she said. ""We hope that something can be done with the trunk of the tree, perhaps a permanent memorial in the village. But it's all a matter of cost. The removal of the tree had been due to be recorded for the BBC's The One Show, explained Rob McBride, who has been documenting the history of the Pontfadog Oak for about eight years. ""But events took over, the digger arrived earlier than expected and we had to get on with moving it,"" he said. He said the extensive foliage of the huge tree had been moved about 60m away and was safe in a field until a permanent destination can be found either there or in the village. Mr McBride said they were looking for funding to help with the move. ""It will provide a home for biodiversity for the next 100 years,"" said Mr McBride. ""It was a treasure of a Welsh tree, a fine UK tree too and you wont find another one quite like this."" There are various theories about how old the Pontfadog Oak was, with some claiming it dated back to Roman times, said Mr McBride. ""But the figure of 1,200 years is one that is generally agreed on."" Welsh prince Owain Gwynedd is said to have met his troops under it in the 12th Century before defeating English king Henry II in battle. Although the tree itself is now lost, it could be recreated in future. Samples from the tree have been taken by institutions including the Royal Botanical Gardens Kew, with the aim of creating a genetic match for the Pontfadog Oak.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ex-Gaddafi Tuareg fighters boost Mali rebels,"The National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad says it is the result of a merger between two rebel groups, boosted by Tuaregs who fought for Col Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Mali's Tuaregs have long complained that they have been marginalised by the southern government. The NMLA wants independence for northern Mali's desert region. The Tuareg are a nomadic community who mostly live in the Sahara desert and nearby regions of countries across north and west Africa. Mali has been saying since the start of the conflict in Libya that the fall of Col Gaddafi would have a destabilising effect in the region. The BBC's Martin Vogl in the capital, Bamako, says this latest development is why Mali was such a strong supporter of the African Union position on Libya, which favoured a negotiated settlement instead of the Nato-led bombing campaign. Our correspondent says that ethnic Tuaregs with dreams of a new rebellion have decided to seize the moment, with the return of their well armed and well trained brothers, to present a tougher stance. He says their demands are more radical than those of previous rebel groups. NMLA spokesman Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed said high-ranking officers from Libya had joined the new group. ""We've overcome our differences and will now present common political demands which reflect the profound aspirations of this population,"" he said. The NMLA has demanded that the government opens negotiations before 5 November. Our correspondent says it not clear whether this group is capable of carrying out large scale military operations or is willing to do so, but that even if it were to launch some small raids on isolated military bases it would be a huge change in the status quo. Security is already a concern in northern Mali following attacks by al-Qaeda's north African wing. In a sign of the government's concern, Interior Minister General Kafougouna Kona is heading to the region this week. Our correspondent says he is one of President Amadou Toumani Toure's most trusted men and someone who has a lot of experience negotiating peace with rebel Tuareg factions. Before he was ousted, Col Gaddafi had helped broker a deal to end a Tuareg rebellion in neighbouring Niger. Many former fighters then went to Libya to join the army. But in recent months, convoys of former Gaddafi loyalists have been crossing the desert to escape reprisals by the forces who ousted Libya's long-time leader.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Angry calls and threats over Chesterfield FC vaccines,"Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived. The woman has reported the threat to Derbyshire Police, which has confirmed it is investigating. She told the BBC: ""My personal details have been put out and I've actually had threats because of this. I got a call saying they knew where I and my family live and to get ready. ""I'm trying to do my job and I've had almost 40 calls this morning. People are phoning the surgery to complain about what's happened because it's been misinterpreted by a reporter who rang me yesterday and was really aggressive. ""It's become very upsetting. I've been on to the police this morning trying to deal with the threats. It's not nice."" She said the players and staff members were given the Pfizer vaccine, which is stored at sub-zero temperatures and has to be used up after being thawed. It comes after a thousand doses of Pfizer vaccine - worth £12,000 - had to be thrown away in Warwickshire because a parcel was left unrefrigerated for two-and-a-half hours. ""They are very precious vaccines and we are trying desperately not to waste them,"" said the NHS staff member who was threatened. ""They had to get there within 15 minutes or it would have gone down the drain. ""We're working 12 hours a day, seven days a week to try and get this done and all of that work has been overshadowed by this."" The National League club has provided testing facilities at its stadium during the pandemic and is in discussions about hosting a vaccination centre. The PA news agency said it understands three players and three members of staff were given vaccines, but the club has not confirmed this figure. A spokesman for the football club said: ""A small number of Chesterfield players and staff - most of whom are classed as vulnerable people - have received the Covid-19 vaccine. ""In line with the NHS directive - that doctors and staff have the discretion to ensure that they can make full use of any unused vaccines, rather than have any go to waste - the people concerned were called at very short notice to receive the vaccine. ""They were only contacted after the surgery had exhausted all other viable options. Those involved were keen that these vaccines were not wasted, which would have been the case had they not received them."" NHS Derby and Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding what happened. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Theresa May offers some Brexit answers,"By Carole WalkerPolitical correspondent, BBC News For more than three months since the referendum she has said little about how she will deliver the vote of the British people. That much-repeated phrase ""Brexit means Brexit"" sounded increasingly meaningless as the pressure mounted for her to say when, how and on what terms Britain would leave the EU. Now we have some answers to the first two questions. Article 50 will be triggered by the end of March next year beginning the formal negotiations with our EU partners and will have to be completed by the end of March 2019, though the departure date could be later than that. Key demand This will leave the prime minister with just over a year to explain and sell the Brexit arrangements to the public before the next election which must be held in 2020. The repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act will mean that all EU laws will be transferred into UK law and will no longer override domestic legislation. The Great Repeal Bill will be introduced in the Queen's speech next year but it will not take effect until the moment Britain leaves the EU. It's a key demand of leading Brexiteers and has already been welcomed by former minister Iain Duncan Smith as a big and positive announcement. This will also go some way towards answering the demands for a vote in Parliament. For a government with such a slim majority that could be tricky. Negotiating stance Ministers are already giving explicit assurances that the process will not mean eroding workers' rights - pointing out that in many areas, including annual and parental leave, UK law goes further than the minimum standards offered under EU law. But the opposition could seek more concrete commitments. Ministers know they cannot expect an easy ride but believe that it would be difficult for any party to vote against a Bill which is a key plank of implementing the will of the British people. The big remaining question of course is what the government's negotiating stance will be, how it will balance the need to reduce immigration whilst getting a good trade deal with the EU. The prime minister said she would look at the various ways of bringing in the controls on immigration which the British people want, but would not put her cards on the table. Until the government sets out its terms for a future deal the arguments and debates will continue over what Brexit will really mean.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Street advertising boards to be banned in Edinburgh,"Members of the city council's transport and environment committee unanimously agreed to a city-wide ban on the street clutter as an ""equalities issue"". The committee heard from its equalities champion, Derek Howie, who spoke about his experience with his guide dog. An army of enforcement officers will make sure the ban is not flouted. There could be potential to issue fixed penalties to those who do not adhere to the ban. Officers have received complaints in the city centre, but also areas including Portobello and Gorgie. Mr Howie said: ""Edinburgh is a busy capital city, it's thriving, it's booming. We have many people wanting to come and live in Edinburgh - that means a lot of people in a finite amount of space. ""We are facing a situation where the streets are immensely crowded. We have to be inclusive. It's not a city just for the fit and able, it's a city for everyone. ""If we don't improve the situation, we will be excluding people from the city centre."" Impact on business The committee also heard from Justin Davis from Edinburgh Pub Crawl, who asked for the effect of a ban on businesses and, in particular, walking tours, to be considered. He said: ""Whilst we recognise the city wants to remove all the temporary advertising, we want to consider that you are absolutely sure when it happens, it does not harm businesses. ""We have been doing walking tours for about eight years and have always had some kind of signage on the Royal Mile. Without a signage board of any kind, we miss out on that market entirely."" Convener of the Transport and Environment Committee, Cllr Lesley Macinnes, said: ""It's absolutely clear that we are very aware of the potential impact on business and we are very aware of the need for mitigation. ""We should not, however, forget the purpose is an equalities issue"". Blindness charity RNIB Scotland has welcomed the decision. The charity's chairwoman Sandra Wilson, who is herself blind, said: ""While we want businesses to prosper, our streets should not be an obstacle course to be negotiated. ""A third of blind and partially-sighted people surveyed by RNIB said they had been injured by pavement clutter when walking outside. Some felt so intimidated they ended up staying isolated in their homes. This is surely unacceptable. ""I lived in Edinburgh for many years and found it an easy city to get around, despite having no sight. Today it's a different story. I visit frequently but don't walk around much because of street clutter."" Related Internet Links The City of Edinburgh Council",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Friends and enemies in the North,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Clearly, this is more than a little local difficulty. Lives and jobs are at stake. If you live in the area and are desperate to know what your life is going to look like in the next few weeks, I'm afraid that a running conflict between Downing Street and the leaders where you live mean you can't be sure yet. This evening, the two sides can't even agree on what they actually discussed today. Believe the local leaders and this morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme that has supported millions of wages any further - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around £15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of cooperation, that meeting went south. 'Tit for tat' There was no mention of the hardship fund that had, according to one side, been discussed. And the meeting is said to have broken up abruptly, with no agreement and a ""surreal"" sudden end, one attendee told me. Since then, Andy Burnham, who proclaimed he would ""stand firm"" on the steps of Manchester's Central Library last week, has written to the prime minister, expressing frustration the offer that seemed to be on the table has miraculously disappeared. But on the other side, the government has gone on the record to say North West's leaders are mistaken to think such a deal was ever on the table. There's even a dispute over exactly how the hospital statistics are being interpreted. The tit for tat in this row of course matters much less than the impact on the area and those who live there, contemplating more uncertainty as each day goes on. 'Risky fight' Government sources say the situation has to be brought to a resolution - a hint that the tighter restrictions could soon be imposed. And the ministers' move to a regional, rather than a national, approach would always bring some tensions. But it is a pretty extraordinary and risky political fight, perhaps for both sides. With more parts of the country in talks, it is a conflict the government would rather not repeat.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Aberdeen lockdown: 'It feels never ending',"The tightening of lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen has caused disappointment for lots of hospitality workers. Poppy Chisholm-White, who works at the Siberia Bar and Hotel in the city, says she is ""gutted"". ""It's really hard to get your head around when the rest of the country is kind of normal but we're not allowed to see each other,"" the 20-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new restrictions - in which bars, cafes and restaurants will be shut for at least seven days - on Wednesday. Poppy's bar - not linked to a rise in cases in the city - actually shut the day before that. ""Everyone got a bit of a fright and feels deflated about it,"" she says. From socially distanced tables and queues, to regular cleaning, sanitising and a one-way system, Poppy says her bar ""followed all the guidance"". The precautions and focus on safety also made Poppy feel ""100%"" safe in her job. ""But it was frustrating to see other people not taking it quite as seriously."" She says it's hard to ""monitor drunk people"" and despite trying their best to warn people - there were still cases of customers ""walking the wrong way or going between tables"". ""To be honest, we did expect it a bit because when you tell people they're allowed, they're going to drink, speak and hug their friends."" ""It's almost like organised fun."" The new lockdown is causing financial concern for Poppy, as she says she doesn't qualify for furlough. ""And it's just a shame not to be working because I love being there and I'm really close to everyone that I work with."" 'It's not a joke' Poppy feels the decision to let bars and restaurants open indoors was ""perhaps too soon"". ""The queues can just get out of hand and drunk people can't be told sometimes."" She adds: ""I'd say have fun, but don't go seeing every single one of your friends. ""It's not a joke. People are dying and are ill. You can't just go and act like everything's normal."" Does she think things will be back to normal even after lockdown? ""I think it's going to be even stricter, and even more monitored.

'Virtual Lolita' aims to trap chatroom paedophiles,"Negobot uses artificial intelligence (AI) software to chat realistically and mimic the language used by teenagers. The ""virtual Lolita"" starts off neutral but will adopt any of seven personalities according to the intensity of interactions. Experts say it can help overburdened police but may risk trapping people unfairly. The team behind the project at the University of Deusto near Bilbao say the software represents a real advance. One of its creators, Dr Carlos Laorden, said that in the past ""chatbots"" have tended to be very predictable. ""Their behaviour and interest in a conversation are flat, which is a problem when attempting to detect untrustworthy targets like paedophiles,"" he noted. By contrast, the Negobot uses advanced decision-making strategies known as ""game theory"" to simulate convincing chats as they develop. It can take the lead in conversations, and remember specific facts about what had been discussed previously, and with whom. Child-like behaviour The so-called conversational agent also uses child-like language and slang, introducing spelling mistakes and contractions to further spoof the predator. Negobot would be used in a chatroom where suspected paedophiles are thought to be lurking. It initiates a chat as a fairly passive participant. It then adapts its behaviour according to the grooming techniques used by the suspect to try to win over its trust and friendship. For example, if the suspect does not appear to be enticed into having a conversation, the software can appear offended or get more insistent. And it will respond to more aggressive advances - like requests for personal information - by trying to find out more about the suspect. This can include details such as their social network profile and mobile number, information which can then be used by police to start an investigation. John Carr, a UK government adviser on child protection, welcomed any move to relieve the burden on real-world policing. But he warned the software risked enticing people to do things they otherwise would not. ""Undercover operations are extremely resource-intensive and delicate things to do. It's absolutely vital that you don't cross a line into entrapment which will foil any potential prosecution"", he said. To date, the software has been field tested on Google's chat service and could be translated into other languages. It has already attracted the attention of the Basque police force. But researchers admit that it does have limitations and will need to be monitored. Although it is has broad conversational abilities, it is not yet sophisticated enough to detect certain human traits like irony.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Save the Waverley' paddle steamer appeal launched,"The Waverley's 2019 excursion season had to be cancelled following the discovery of serious problems with its boilers. The operators said the 73-year-old ship needed the marine equivalent of ""open heart surgery"". Enthusiasts and politicians gathered at Glasgow's Pacific Quay to mark the official start of fundraising. Named after Sir Walter Scott's debut novel, the ship was built just after World War Two as a replacement for a vessel sunk during the Dunkirk evacuation. In 1975, at the end of its working life, it was bought for £1 by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society. For generations of Scots it has been a familiar sight, offering ""doon the watter"" trips along the west coast, carrying 130,00 passengers a year. The discovery of serious problems with the boilers earlier this year meant this is the first time since 1812 there has been no paddle steamer operating off Britain's coast. Operators Waverley Excursions Ltd said the iconic red, white and black twin funnels would have to be lifted off, and large sections of decking removed to allow the boilers and other equipment to be lifted out. The replacement boilers are expected to extend Waverley's operational life by a further 20 to 25 years. The Waverley - facts and figures Paul Semple, who heads the team which operates the ship said £100,000 had been donated already to the appeal. ""We're heartened by the support so far - it's clear that huge numbers of people around Britain and around the world want to see Waverley sail again,"" he said. ""But the financial challenge which faces Waverley remains very significant, and we urgently need more funds to let us place the orders and then carry out the work over the next nine months."" In recent weeks, the organisers have drawing up detailed plans and costings for the repairs. Mr Semple he was determined not to allow the ship to become a ""static relic"". ""Waverley's truly unique status as the world's last seagoing paddle steamer mustn't be taken for granted,"" he said. ""Not for the first time, the future of the ship hangs in the balance. Once again, it's time to save the Waverley.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Financial tsunami' forced police officers to retire,"Shaun Sawyer, chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, said they had ""agonised"" over the decision. Five police forces are contesting test cases after hundreds of officers were forced out of their jobs. The A19 clause allows for officers with 30 years' service to be forced out. Five police forces - Nottinghamshire, North Wales, South Wales, West Midlands, and Devon and Cornwall - contest the allegations made at the Central London Employment Tribunal. At the Devon and Cornwall force it was decided that 700 police officers and 350 members of police staff would have to lose their jobs. Mr Sawyer, who was deputy chief constable of the force at the time, admitted A19 was ""indirectly discriminatory"" on grounds of age and that legal advice was taken to make sure its use was ""justified"". Mr Sawyer described the move as ""the least worst decision to make to deliver an efficient force"". He said the decision to use A19 was ""agonised over as was the decision to reduce the number of police staff"". ""Reducing the number of police officers went against every fibre of what was, for me, 25 years of policing. ""There was a financial tsunami facing public service and policing in particular."" A19 suspended Under cross examination by Paul Gilroy QC, representing claimants from the Police Superintendents' Association, he admitted cost was a ""significant part"" of the decision-making process. By autumn 2010, the force - then led by Stephen Otter - realised it would have to save at least £44m over the course of the next four years, following on from the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR). ""I am aware that the claimants contend that the rationale for A19 was solely or overwhelmingly a matter of finance,"" Mr Sawyer said in his statement. ""It is obvious that without the imposition of the CSR Devon and Cornwall Police would not have chosen to dramatically reduce its police officer and police staff numbers and profile so dramatically or so quickly."" Asked by Mr Gilroy if the force would have considered A19 if it had not been for the CSR, Mr Sawyer replied: ""Absolutely not. ""Were it not for a £44m, later £49m, hole in the budget, we wouldn't have been making police officers leave the force in any way."" Devon and Cornwall Police made the decision last September to suspend the use of A19.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wisbech murder: Dzilva Butiene 'relied' on man who killed her,"Mother-of-two Dzilva Butiene was murdered by Kestutis Bauzys - who had convinced her to move from Lithuania to England - in Wisbech, in April 2017. A Domestic Homicide Review said Ms Butiene, 48, who spoke limited English, ""seemed to have nowhere to turn to"". The report said it was likely others would be ""in a very similar position"". When the body of Ms Butiene was discovered in the flat they shared in the Cambridgeshire town, she had more than 60 bruises and marks on her chest and abdomen. Bauzys was jailed for life with a minimum of 17-and-a-half years. Although the report is anonymised, the BBC understands it relates to Ms Butiene's death. A report, made by Fenland Community Safety Partnership (FCSP), said Ms Butiene was unable to find consistent work after her treatment for cervical cancer in 2014, had few close friends and very limited English and was unaware of any support agencies. ""She appears to have become reliant on the perpetrator for her needs,"" it said. ""It is difficult to imagine how her life must have been, given that she seems to have had nowhere to turn to, or been aware of how she could have sought support."" Ms Butiene and Bauzys had known each other from school and he persuaded her to move to the UK, where he was already living, ""on the promise of a better lifestyle"" in September 2013. She was described as a ""tiny, meek woman"" by a previous employer, while he was known to be a body builder who used steroids. When Ms Butiene was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn for a seizure and spasms in November 2016 she told staff she was depressed ""but said that by agreement with her partner she had agreed not to disclose this to hospital staff"". Bauzys also told staff he injected her with magnesium sulphate. The report said: ""Both of these actions give some indication of a controlling relationship and if [Ms Butiene] had been minded to discuss an abusive relationship this is the type of situation which should be identified as an opportunity and maximised."" It added a referral to mental health services for her depression or support for alcohol dependency, which had increased, appeared not have been considered. Following recommendations from the report, the hospital's chief nurse, Emma Hardwick, said it had ""revised process [which] includes direction for staff to ask all patents direct questions relating to domestic abuse"". A FCSP spokesman said review recommendations are ""translated into an action plan, with individual actions being identified as either national, county or Fenland specific"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Covid lockdown: 'My closed hair salons cost me £1,000 a day'","""We have worked out it's probably £1,000 a day in debt that we have incurred in being closed,"" she said. She is part of a campaign calling on the government to cut VAT to help mend the hair and beauty sector's finances. A survey of salon owners suggests that 56% are considering closing. The Save our Salons campaign group also estimates that nearly four in five will recruit no apprentices this year Any closures would harm the finances of women the most - almost 90% of salon workers are women. The group says there are 45,000 salons providing jobs for nearly 300,000 people. Losing skills Hairdressers and nail salons are set to re-open from 12 April along with many other retailers. But a long period of closure means they, like many businesses, have been racking up debts. Campaigners say their businesses operate on low profit margins of between 2-5%. ""We urgently need our VAT cut to 5%, the same chop in VAT enjoyed by restaurants and bars since July last year,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Without help to rebuild their finances, businesses may find it preferable to close their doors, she said. ""We employ such a lot of trainees - where will we be in five years' time if we lose those skill sets?"" she said. Like many businesses, hers and others in the beauty trade have received government help, notably in the form of the furlough scheme, which has paid many staff wages while people have been out of work. ""Furlough has been fantastic but it's not free,"" Ms Ward said. Employers must still make national insurance contributions. Many beauty companies have been paying full rent during the lockdown, despite making little or no income. Most sales come from treatments rather than products, she said. Larger salons with lots of employees, big rents and high rates have particularly struggled, says Gina Conway, who owns three hair and beauty salons in London. She opened her first 20 years ago. Her salons have been closed for 238 days in the year since the first lockdown. ""Because hairdressers can't do takeaway or home visits or online haircuts we are all really struggling to cover our costs,"" she told the BBC. She still has to pay rent, insurance and utility bills. Support from her landlord has been mixed. One has offered a discount during the lockdown, one has not replied to her requests and one won't budge. ""I have a successful business and I plan on growing, I'm just holding my breath on what the government can do to help,"" she says.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fishlake floods: Stranded residents helped by community heroes,"Driving a 32-year-old Land Rover through several feet of flood water, Steve McCarthy helped ferry people and vital supplies around Fishlake. He and his teenage sons rescued an 85-year-old woman from her home, taking her to the Hare and Hounds pub which has opened up as a refuge. The 44-year-old bus driver said he wanted to do what he could to help. ""Somebody put a request out on Facebook for people with 4x4 vehicles to help, and as my son has a Land Rover Defender, we went up to see what we could do. ""We started at about 10 o'clock on Saturday, finishing about 10.30 at night. At one point I was waist-deep in water."" Mr McCarthy, who lives in nearby Stainforth, collected food, bedding, fresh water and hygiene products donated by a local Asda supermarket, before taking them to those in need. ""Then it started coming in from other supermarkets,"" he said. ""Chip shops, takeaways, all over the place. We were sending big pans of curries down to Fishlake - one from the Mumbai restaurant to the Hare and Hounds pub late at night."" He was helped by sons Jack, 19, who owns the Land Rover, and 17-year-old Ben. The owners of the Hare and Hounds, Angie and Scott Godfrey, opened their premises for people to sleep and get a hot meal. The couple were name-checked by ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband when he visited the flood-hit area on Saturday - helped in the Land Rover by the McCarthys. Four-wheel drive or boat is the only means of transport in parts of the village, where severe flood warnings remain in place around the River Don. Speaking about the stranded congregating at the pub, Mrs Godfrey said: ""The first night everyone was devastated, absolutely devastated. ""We had grown men crying, which was horrific, but spirits have lifted now."" Claire Holling, who runs the Old Butchers cafe, said many people spent Saturday night in the Hare and Hounds or in the church. She said the pub and her cafe had become the centre of a community pulling together to get through. ""I just managed to get here on the back of a tractor and I live in the village,"" she said. ""We've opened up and we're making sure everyone has bacon and sausage sandwiches and a warm settee to sit on. It's getting quite full in here now. ""Everyone's pulling together and making sure vulnerable people are being looked after."" The council was urging people in Fishlake to leave on Monday, as more rain is forecast. Residents of Fishlake said it was the first time the village had flooded in 100 years. A yellow warning for rain remains in place over parts of Yorkshire and the East Midlands on Monday.

Little Mix's Jesy Nelson praised for 'inspiring' documentary Odd One Out,"Odd One Out, made by BBC Three, aired on Thursday on BBC One and revealed how comments from trolls had led the Little Mix star to attempt suicide. The 28-year-old, who rose to fame on The X Factor in 2011, spoke of how she became almost ""obsessed"" with reading negative comments about herself. Actress Emily Atack tweeted that the film should be shown in schools. ""Show it in schools, tell your mates, watch it,"" she tweeted. The Only Way Is Essex star Georgia Kousoulou agreed. Stacey Dooley described Nelson as a ""total star"", while EastEnders actress Tilly Keeper praised the singer's bravery, saying her story was ""necessary in today's technological and social media crazed climate"". Reality TV star Charlotte Crosby agreed that Nelson was brave to speak out, and called on social media platforms to do more to stamp out trolls. Nelson's Little Mix bandmates told the programme about the toll internet bullies took on the singer. ""The three of us didn't know what to do,"" said Jade Thirlwall. ""We just had to watch this amazing, funny girl become a bit like a broken doll. It was horrible."" She added: ""I remember feeling really angry. I wanted to just find every single person that had ever said anything horrible to her, look them in the eye and say, 'Look what you've done to this girl.'"" In its review, The Guardian gave the show four stars, calling it ""a modern fairytale in reverse"". Critic Rebecca Nicholson wrote: ""This raw, candid documentary explores the fallout Nelson faced after winning The X Factor with Little Mix: a relentless barrage of abuse from cyberbullies."" The Times' Joe Clay said it showed Nelson ""putting on a brave face against social-media trolls"", while Alice Vincent in The Telegraph suggested ""it's not just Jesy Nelson"" who has suffered such treatment. While Nelson's mental health has gradually improved since she deleted Twitter, Leigh-Anne Pinnock from the band said there had been a lasting impact. ""She is a little bit of a nightmare when it comes to video shoots and photo shoots,"" she said. ""It has been a bit hard within the group. People don't realise what bullying and trolling can do to someone. The trolls took away her love for it and her passion. But how does she get that back?"" Nelson announced earlier this year that she was making a documentary exploring body image and mental health because she wanted to ""make a change and a difference to other people's lives"".

Burger King remove 'racist' chopsticks ad,"By Kris Bramwell & Kerry Allen BBC News & BBC Monitoring The advert for a new Vietnamese burger in New Zealand has sparked a debate over whether the advert is harmless fun or culturally insensitive and racist. A clip of the advert posted to Twitter by Maria Mo, a Korean woman living in New Zealand, has been viewed more than 2.9M times. In her subsequent thread she berates Burger King's attempts to make fun of how Asians eat and described the advert as racist. She tweeted: ""I'm so sick of racism of any kind. Of the kind that makes fun of different cultures. Say no to every single manifestation of it."" Others feel equally as strong: ""I always thought that Burger King was better than KFC and McDonalds, but now I don't want to eat their products,"" wrote one disgruntled post on the Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo. Some on social media have likened this to the racism row faced by fashion house Dolce & Gabbana after they posted videos of a Chinese model eating Italian food with chopsticks in 2018. Twitter user TatianaKing wrote: ""I thought brands learned their lesson after the D&G chopsticks fiasco... then again I'm not surprised."" In China, the Burger King advert has been viewed more than eight million times on the news website Pear Video and tens of thousands of Weibo users have been posting about it. The hashtag, which translates as #NewBurgerKingAdvertAllegedlyRacist, has also been used more than 12,000 times. Not all posts are critical, however. ""Whatever anyone does, it's discrimination, we're bursting with persecution and paranoia. What can brands do in the future to introduce Asian elements?"" asked one user who had sympathy for Burger King. Another saw the funny side of the advert: ""This is just a joke that westerners can't use chopsticks. Why is it only in recent years that we hear that Chinese people feel discriminated against? Am I meant to get angry?"" And others believe those who have been offended by the advert are sensitive and show that people in China have an inferiority complex. Burger King has now deleted the clip which appeared on their Instagram account for New Zealand and has withdrawn the television advert. A spokesperson said: ""The ad in question is insensitive and does not reflect our brand values regarding diversity and inclusion."" You may also be interested in:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Social mobility: Poorer children 'making less progress',"The Social Mobility Commission said poorer pupils were often overtaken by their better-off peers even if they had outperformed them at primary school. The gap, which was most apparent in poor white children, has widened every year since 2012. The Department for Education accepted it had ""more to do"" on the issue. Researchers examined the GCSE results of pupils on free school meals and those who were not, across two sets of eight subjects. These results were then measured in relation to how the pupils had performed in their Key Stage 2 Sats tests, in their final year of primary school. How do poorer children do at selective schools? The difference in progress was said to be partly the result of poorer children being more likely to be placed in lower sets, having access to less qualified teachers and having lower expectations set for them. On average, children on free school meals made between a quarter and a third of a GCSE grade less progress than their more affluent peers. Home life had a substantial impact on progress with poorer children less likely to benefit from effective homework routines, access to books and computers and parents being less likely to help with the work. The report said poorer children were also more at risk of behavioural issues and being excluded. Most low-income ethnic minority groups were found to make progress that was in line with the national average for all pupils due to more effective support at home. Headteachers told researchers that reduced school funding was already putting progress at risk. Recommendations made by the commission include: The analysis did not include special schools, independent schools, pupil referral units and other schools including British overseas schools and schools for service children. Commission chairman Alan Milburn said the findings were a ""shocking feature"" of the education system, with progress being made in primary school ""all but wiped out"" during secondary school ""This is not just an issue for the government. If social mobility is to improve, schools need to do more to bridge the education attainment divide between poorer children and their better-off classmates."" 'Break down barriers' A Department for Education spokesman said it was working to give everyone a ""fair chance"" at school but acknowledged there was more to be done. ""That's why we have set out plans to create more good school places, in more parts of the country, by ending the ban on new grammar schools, where we know bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds thrive. ""We have announced 12 Opportunity Areas across England, backed with £72m investment, where we are working to break down the barriers to social mobility that too many still face,"" he added. The government has also announced it is spending £2.5bn this year to combat inequality in education through the pupil premium. The research, carried out by think-tank LKMco and researchers from Education Datalab, analysed data from the National Pupil Database.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Trump’s disinfectant and sunlight claims fact-checked,"By Reality Check teamBBC News The Reality Check team has been looking into both of these issues. Claim 1 ""I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs."" Mr Trump suggested injecting patients with disinfectants might help treat coronavirus. Using a disinfectant can kill viruses on surfaces, but this is crucially only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective. Doctors have appealed to people not to ingest or inject disinfectant, as there are concerns people will think this is a good idea and die. ""Injecting bleach or disinfectant at the dose required to neutralise viruses in the circulating blood would likely result in significant, irreversible harm and probably a very unpleasant death,"" says Rob Chilcott, professor of toxicology at the University of Hertfordshire."" He adds that it would also ""not have much effect on viral particles within the cells"". Reckitt Benckiser, a leading manufacturer of disinfectant products including Lysol and Dettol, has issued a statement in response to the president's comments. It said: ""We must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route)."" Mr Trump has subsequently defended his comment claiming ""I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters."" Claim 2 ""I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too... So, we'll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute - that's pretty powerful."" Mr Trump has also floated the idea of exposing patients to ""ultraviolet or just very powerful light"". There is some evidence that, in general, viruses on surfaces die more quickly when exposed directly to sunlight. But we don't know how much or how long they have to be exposed for UV light to have an effect. And again, this is only about infected objects and surfaces - not about what happens once the virus is inside your body. By the time the virus has taken hold inside your body, no amount of UV light on your skin is going to make a difference. ""UV irradiation and high heat are known to kill virus particles on surfaces,"" says Dr Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at Kings College London. But ""neither sitting in the sun, nor heating, will kill a virus replicating in an individual patient's internal organs"".

Male depression 'set to increase',"An article in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests economic and social changes will erode traditional sources of male self-esteem. The authors say men will struggle with the shift away from traditional male and female roles. The Men's Health Forum said male identity was bound up in employment. One of the authors, Dr Boadie Dunlop from Emory University School of Medicine, said: ""Women are almost twice as likely to develop major depressive disorder in their lifetime as men, but we believe this difference may well change in the coming decades."" He argues that traditional males jobs such as manufacturing or physical labour are being lost, either through improved technology or jobs moving to other countries. On the other hand the article states that as women are now more likely to go to university than men so the number of households where the main breadwinner is female will increase. Male identity ""Men's failure to fulfil the role of breadwinner is associated with greater depression and marital conflict,"" the article states. Dr Dunlop said: ""Western men will face a difficult road in the 21st century, particularly those with low levels of education. We believe economic and societal changes will have significant implications for men's mental health."" Peter Baker, chief executive of the Men's Health Forum, said: ""This really confirms what we already know about unemployment and that it has a much bigger impact on men, mainly because male identity is bound up as a worker. ""Male social networks are based around work so losing a job can lead to isolation and depression."" Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, a consultant psychiatrist, said: ""If you've spent 20 years pouring steel and the mill closes you can't just go and do something else. ""It seems self evident in a recession with joblessness that it will be bad for physical and mental health and some people will get depression. ""Having to send your wife out and feel like a parasite surely would put up the rate of depression, but overall is it unique to men? I don't know."" Mr Baker said men do not seek help when they have depression and were ""more likely to self medicate in the pub"" than seek professional care. He said: ""As we see more men affected we need to think about how to support and get them back to work.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Princess Beatrice marries Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in private Windsor ceremony,"The wedding took place on Friday morning at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge. It was attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with other close relatives. Beatrice was initially due to marry in May but coronavirus delayed the plans. The new date had not been announced in advance and Buckingham Palace said the ceremony was ""small"". The wedding took place at 11:00 BST in accordance with all relevant government guidelines, the palace said in a statement. When the coronavirus lockdown began on 23 March, weddings in England were banned under almost all circumstances. However, since 4 July, ceremonies of up to 30 people have been allowed to take place. The Queen, 94, and Philip, 99, have been isolating at Windsor since March and the ceremony is believed to be the first time the pair have attended a family gathering since lockdown began. Later on Friday, she was pictured knighting Captain Sir Tom Moore, the 100-year-old who raised more than £32m for NHS charities - her first official engagement in person since lockdown. After the investiture, the Queen told the veteran fundraiser: ""My granddaughter got married this morning. Both Philip and I managed to get there - very nice."" The princess, 31, and Mr Mapelli Mozzi, 35, had originally planned to marry on 29 May at the Chapel Royal, St James Palace, in London. The new venue of Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park - a short drive from Windsor Castle - is Beatrice's childhood home. Her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, still live at the property and also attended the ceremony. It was held at the chapel regularly used by the Queen as her place of worship when she is staying at Windsor. Mr Mapelli Mozzi - known as Edo - and Beatrice began dating in autumn 2018. They got engaged during a weekend trip to Italy last September. Their families have known one another for many years. The couple are said to have started a relationship after meeting again at Beatrice's sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank. The wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in October 2018 was attended by 850 guests, while 1,200 people chosen by ballot followed proceedings from the grounds. Beatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, is not a full-time working royal but works for Afiniti, an artificial intelligence software firm, where she is vice president of partnerships and strategy. Mr Mapelli Mozzi is the son of former Olympic skier Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi and Nikki Williams-Ellis and is a count himself. The princess has become a stepmother, as he has a young son named Wolfie with ex-fiancee Dara Huang.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
African swine fever: Australia expels Vietnamese woman over pork haul,"The 45-year-old arrived at Sydney airport on Saturday with raw pork, quail, pate, squid and other food items, officials said. It is the first time Australia has cancelled a visa over food under strict new bio-security laws aimed at keeping African swine fever out of the country. The contagious disease has decimated pig numbers across Asia and Europe. ""In the midst of what is potentially the biggest animal disease event the world has seen, it beggars belief that someone would deliberately attempt to bring pork meat past our border,"" Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie said in a statement. Under an amendment to Australia's Migration Act passed in April, visitor visas can be shortened or cancelled for bio-security contraventions. On-the-spot fines can also be given to offenders, but authorities said that - given the scale of her offence - the unnamed woman was sent back to Vietnam instead and is banned from visiting Australia for three years. Pork is big business in Australia - official figures estimate that the country's pork industry is worth more than five billion Australian dollars ($3.4bn; £2.6bn). Australian bio-security agencies have stepped up screening efforts at airports and mail distributors in an effort to contain African swine fever. Concerns were raised after the disease was detected last month in East Timor, one of Australia's closest neighbours. Ms McKenzie said that 27 tonnes of pork products have been seized at Australia's borders since February. The minister noted a ""concerning"" increase in the number of these products contaminated with ASF, saying contamination rates jumped from 15% in February to 48% in September. ""That is why, if you are travelling from an African swine flu affected country, we are watching you,"" said Ms McKenzie. Countries across Asia have been struggling to contain the spread of ASF, an incurable condition that is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs. The disease has a mortality rate of up to 100%, according to the UN. It emerged in East Africa in the early 1990s, moved through sub-Saharan Africa, and has also been recorded in Europe. China - which has half the world's pigs, and where pork is often a staple food - confirmed an outbreak last August. Since then, more than one million pigs have been culled in China, and over five million in Vietnam. In South Korea hundreds of soldiers and civilian hunters have been deployed along the country's border with North Korea to kill wild boars and feral pigs to stop the spread of the disease.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The man who brought the Ryder Cup to Wales,"By Nick ServiniBBC Wales business correspondent After making a fortune in the telecommunications industry, he bought the manor house where he was born, invested more than £100m in it and then secured the Ryder Cup. That is what he has achieved in single-minded fashion. So how did it all start? Sixty-seven years ago he was born in the Celtic Manor when it was a maternity hospital. He was raised in Newbridge and at the age of 15 moved to London to begin an apprenticeship with a research lab that was then part of the Post Office. In his own words he then ""pigged out"" on education with an electronics degree at Swansea University. He was offered a job while on holiday in Canada and that is where his first big break came after setting up a company called Mitel. It was the early 1970s and touch-tone phones were gradually replacing rotary dial phones around the world. The expensive pieces of kit to use these were in the telephone exchanges. At the time they cost $1,500 each. Sir Terry and his business partner developed one that cost $150. At a tenth of the cost Mitel quickly dominated the market. The other landmark break was with a company called Newbridge Networks which he sold at the peak of the dot.com bubble a decade ago for $7.5bn, making him Wales' first billionaire. He is still starting about four companies a year for his business empire that employs around 4,000 people around the world. Sir Terry puts his wealth down to a combination of persistence and timing. He insists he was never an overnight success and only concentrated on areas of technology that he knew about. The man who runs many of his companies now is Simon Gibson. He puts the success of Sir Terry down to his relationship with his customers. He spends large amounts of time with them discussing what they want so that he then only invests in developing products that are needed by the market. Sir Terry is also remarkably unsentimental about the Ryder Cup coming to Wales. He's repeatedly dismissed it as some kind of indulgence, instead pointing to it as an investment for the Celtic Manor business. Surprisingly, he doesn't play golf and would much rather talk industrial history than putting technique. His son Dylan, who runs the Celtic Manor, says his father will watch very little golf over the weekend as he will be wrapped up in wall to wall meetings with the 300 guests he is personally inviting from all over the world for each day of the event. And what will Sir Terry Matthews do after the Ryder Cup? He may be ideally placed to retire to the golf course but it seems highly unlikely. Colleagues say that despite being around the age when most people scale down their activities, he will never stop looking for deals because starting up companies is the hobby he enjoys doing most in life.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Taio Cruz quits TikTok after 'suicidal thoughts',"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The musician, whose hits include Dynamite and Break Your Heart, said he had been targeted by ""hateful"" videos and comments on the video-sharing app. ""My body was shaking and I had suicidal thoughts,"" he explained on Instagram. ""I pride myself on being mentally resilient so the fact that I felt that way, shocked even me."" The 35-year-old added: ""Some users posted hateful, mocking videos which spurred a feedback loop of negativity, where more and more people began to join in on the mockery and hate. ""My intention was to make some fun videos and interact with my fans, but some, whom I won't mention, were averse to that. ""For my own mental health, I would rather be where I'm welcomed, for now, TikTok is not that place. Social media shouldn't be like this, sadly it is."" The London-born singer rose to fame in the late 2000s, scoring two number one singles in the UK, and writing for artists including Jennifer Lopez, Usher and David Guetta. He joined TikTok earlier this week and quickly gained 85,000 followers - but abruptly deleted all his videos on Wednesday, posting a message that read: ""Never in my life have I had a more negative experience than the past few days on here"". ""This community is not for me,"" he added. The BBC understands that the musician was targeted by messages accusing of him of being irrelevant and ""begging for clout"". One user who wrote, ""I just saw one of his videos [and] scrolled so fast,"" received a response from the star - who simply posted the shrug emoji. The majority of the comments were posted beneath Cruz's own videos, which are no longer available. After the musician deactivated his account, fans sent him messages of support on social media. ""Your music has made me smile from when I was five,"" wrote one Instagram user. ""I'm so sorry, please remember how strong you are."" ""We love you and we're looking forward to hearing more songs from you. You are an absolute legend,"" added another. TikTok star Dixie D'Amelio, who has 38 million followers on the platform, also expressed her concern. ""This makes me so sad,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Y'all bullied a legit music artist off TikTok in under a week… WHAT??? Just be nice.""

China 'buys fighter jets and submarines from Russia',"It is reported to be the first time in a decade that China has made a large-scale military purchase from Russia. Two of the submarines will be built in Russia and two in China. The deal, signed just before last weekend's visit to Moscow by the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, comes as both sides increase military co-operation. Correspondents say Moscow and Beijing are trying to counterbalance what they see as American military dominance. China is buying 24 Su-35 fighters and four Lada-class submarines, reported the Communist Party organ the People's Daily and China Central Television (CCTV). They did not put a value on the purchases. China's official defence budget rose by 11.2% in 2012 - pushing it above $100bn (£65bn) for the first time. But foreign experts have estimated that Beijing's actual military spending could be as much as double the official budget. US defence spending was reported as standing at more than $700bn. Beijing - which is also embroiled in a bitter row over disputed islands with Japan - launched its first aircraft carrier last year. ""The Su-35 fighters can effectively reduce pressure on China's air defence before Chinese-made stealth fighters come online,"" the People's Daily was quoted as saying. It said the two countries were expected to co-operate further in developing military technology - including for S-400 long-range anti-aircraft missiles, 117S large thrust engines, IL-476 large transport aircraft and IL-78 aerial tankers. 'Riposte' Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Moscow from Friday to Sunday for talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin - his first trip abroad since becoming head of state earlier this month. The two countries are also pursuing a number of deals for Russia to supply Chinese industry with oil and liquefied natural gas. President Xi's visit was lauded by the state-run China Daily as a ""well-deserved riposte to Washington for America's military 'pivot' to Asia. Xi is executing China's own 'pivot' - the visit to Moscow to cement ties with"" Mr Putin, the paper said. ""Xi's decision to make Moscow the destination of his first official visit as China's president will give the US a sharp reminder that it is not the only power able to flex its muscles,"" the report, translated by BBC Monitoring, went on.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stoke-on-Trent hotel for homeless secures housing for rough sleepers,"The Crown Hotel, based in Longton in Stoke-on-Trent, closed to the public in March but has provided rooms for rough sleepers with the help of the council. A staff member said she was proud of what staff have been able to achieve. The council said it hoped the government will continue to provide ""adequate funding"" for homelessness. One former rough sleeper who received support from the hotel said he was scared about catching coronavirus on the streets before being given a room. Warwick Chambers said: ""You don't know if you're going to catch it, there's so many people walking past you coughing. ""If we were on the streets we were going to die on the streets,"" he said. As lockdown measures have begun to be eased, drop-in sessions have been held at the hotel by charitable organisation Brighter Futures. Wendy Vernall said she has managed to secure a two-bedroom property to move into when she leaves the hotel. ""I feel over the moon that I've been able to improve myself in the last eight weeks, getting myself the motivation...to think 'yeah, there is a place out there I can call home'"", she said. Nicola Johnson of Brighter Futures said the hotel's work has been ""absolutely vital"" to keep them informed of the coronavirus crisis while Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Abi Brown said she hopes after lockdown the government recognises the ""need to support councils with an adequate level of funding"" to stop people from having to sleep on the streets. ""I'm proud of what we've done,"" said a member of hotel staff, adding ""it feels pretty good"" to be able to ""just get people housed"". Councils in England were given £3.2m from the government as part of an emergency scheme called ""Everyone In"", which was aimed at stopping the spread of the virus and help rough sleepers. But earlier this month, it emerged government funding for that scheme was to end. The government said it had given councils an extra £3.2bn in funding to help them deal with the pandemic, although that money is not specifically for the emergency rough sleeping scheme.

Box ticking: Dubious benefits of midges and ticks explored,"Swatted, warded off with smelly repellent or twisted out with tweezers from where they have burrowed into skin, midges and ticks usually get short shrift by people they encounter. Midge bites can cause irritating red itchy sores while those of ticks can result in serious, long-lasting medical problems. But to raise greater awareness of the health risks the latter can pose to human health, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) has explored the positive benefits of the tiny pests. The pros include their importance as a food source for wild birds. Heather Morning, mountain safety advisor at the MCofS, said there was a serious message behind compiling the list. Ms Morning said: ""Tick bites are linked to an alarming rise in cases of Lyme disease, which can have serious long-term effects on people's lives."" The disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks. Flu-like symptoms and fatigue are often the first noticeable signs of infection. Diagnosed cases of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, but if left untreated neurological problems and joint pain can develop months or years later. Earlier this year, a group called Worldwide Lyme Protest UK urged for more medical professionals to be given the skills to diagnose and treat the infection. Nicola Seal, from Aberdeen, who co-ordinated a protest in May, said it was poorly understood, leaving thousands of patients without the appropriate treatment. Official estimates put the number of new UK cases each year at around 3,000, but Lyme disease charities say the figure could be as high as 15,000 annually because so many people do not have their condition diagnosed. Key ingredient Tourists put off returning to Scotland after being repeatedly bitten by the tiny biting midge are estimated to cost the tourism industry £286m a year, according to expert Dr Alison Blackwell. In 2009, two men cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats in their underwear for charity were badly bitten by midges shortly after reaching the Highlands. Adam Dunn and Gavin Topley, from Branksome, near Bournemouth, had taken no other clothes, money, food or insect repellent for their journey. They relied on offers of free accommodation and meals. Also in 2009 a woman on Skye told how she was using midges as a key ingredient in food for wild birds. Elaine Bunce added the biting insect to beef dripping and flour to create her Original Highland Midge Bites. She advertised in a local newspaper for people to send her expired insects collected from midge killing machines, as it takes a thousand for each ball.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

The examples given are ""stones, ball bearings or eggs"". Animal manure, and any other ""noxious or offensive substance"", are also out. Weapons Unsurprisingly, any kind of weapon is banned. The list includes longbows, spear guns, bolt guns, arrows, blowpipes, swords, antique firearms and explosives. Climbing No climbing ""onto, under, over or around"" barriers erected by the G20 security. Large signs Protest signs are welcome - and as ever, are likely to be creative in their criticisms of world leaders. But the legislation contains specific restrictions on the size of banners and placards allowed. They must be no more than 100cm high x 200cm wide. Political billboards Brisbane Airport, which will welcome world leaders to the summit, would not allow two adverts to be displayed on the grounds they were overly political. One of the adverts campaigned against climate change, the other corruption. In a statement the airport said ""we believe the airport shouldn't be used as a platform for partisan views, whether we agree with those views or not"". Kayaks The laws forbid ""a manually operated surf ski or surfboard, kayak, boat or canoe"". Fires Do not start fires near the G20 summit. But you can be exempt from this rule with a lawful excuse. The very Australian example given is ""a chef at a restaurant in a declared area who lights a gas barbecue"". Masks Masked protestors have been a feature of previous G20 summits, but this one bans masks, balaclavas, and anything capable of disguising or concealing a person's identity. There are exceptions for religious clothing, which is pertinent given Australia's recent political wrangling over Islamic attire. Reptiles Bad news for anyone wanting to bring a pet snake to a protest. ""A reptile, insect or other animal capable of causing physical harm if released in close proximity to a person"" are all prohibited. Kites ""... or other device suspended by airflow and controlled by a string or cord attached to it."" Toy cars and model planes are out too. And one that was not banned... A Brisbane roundabout Ahead of the meeting, President Obama's delegation wanted the demolition of a roundabout in Brisbane so that his armoured limousine aka The Beast would not have to slow down, according to reports in newspaper The Australian. But the request was denied. Brisbane Times, however, quoted a transport ministry spokeswoman as saying she was not aware of any such request.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Eurozone manufacturing growth remains 'meagre',"The latest Markit/CIPS eurozone Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51 in January from 50.6 in December. Although this was only just above the 50 mark, which indicates growth, it was the strongest figure for six months. Eurozone manufacturers are facing a duel problem of weak domestic demand and export performance, Markit said. Cheaper goods On Friday, official data showed deflation in the eurozone deepened in January with prices falling 0.6% in the month compared with a year earlier. Markit's survey found the falling price of oil drove average manufacturing costs down at the fastest pace for five-and-a-half years. Lower cost pressures were partly reflected in average selling prices. Output charges fell for the fifth month in a row and registered the biggest fall for more than a year and a half. The survey was carried out before the European Central Bank (ECB) announced its €1.1tn (£820bn) bond buying programme, which Markit's chief economist Chris Williamson, said should boost business and consumer confidence in the eurozone and weaken the euro further, helping to boost exports. The single currency has already fallen more than 6% versus the US dollar since the start of the year. Mr Williamson said: ""Eurozone manufacturing showed signs of pulling out of the doldrums at the start of the year, but the rate of expansion remained disappointingly meagre, vindicating the ECB's decision to take drastic action to revive the economy. ""The currency's fall should benefit exporting manufacturers in particular over coming months. Lower oil prices will also help reduce manufacturers' costs, with reduced fuel costs also freeing up more consumer income to spend on goods."" Mixed picture Markit said improvements in business conditions were seen in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland during January. But this was offset by manufacturing downturns in France, Italy, Austria and Greece. The rates of contraction in France and Italy stabilised, but Austria and Greece registered bigger downturns. Italy saw a slight rise in output for the first time since September 2014, and the rate of decline in France was the weakest in the eight months. But ""the continuing slump in new orders to both nations may act as an ongoing headwind in coming months"", Markit said. Data from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, showed factory growth there was also slower than previously thought.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Benefit sanctions can cause severe hardship, say MPs","By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance Reporter For the second time in a year, the Work and Pensions Committee has called for an independent enquiry into the way the sanctions are applied. In some cases the MPs suggested that sanctions were causing food poverty and ""severe financial hardship"". Ministers said they would study the report's conclusions before deciding whether an enquiry should go ahead. The MPs want the enquiry to study whether benefit sanctions are being applied appropriately, fairly and proportionately. ""No claimant should have their benefit payment reduced to zero when they are at risk of severe financial hardship, to the extent of not being able to feed themselves or their families, or pay their rent,"" said Dame Anne Begg, the chair of the committee. The MPs were particularly concerned that hardship payments - to alleviate cases of hardship -are often only available after 15 days of sanctions. ""It is not reasonable to expect people to live without any source of income for two weeks,"" said Dame Anne. 'Postcode lottery' The MPs have also demanded more information about the number of people who commit suicide after their benefit payments have been stopped. Since February 2012, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has investigated 49 cases in which claimants committed suicide. But it is not known in how many cases those claimants had been sanctioned. The DWP said benefit sanctions were not new, and they were important to encourage people to find work. ""As the report recognises, sanctions are a vital backstop in the welfare system and are only used in a small minority of cases where claimants don't do all they can to look for work,"" a DWP spokesman said. ""Every day Jobcentre Plus advisers work hard to help people into jobs, and we continue to spend around £94bn a year on working age benefits to provide a safety net that supports millions of people,"" she said. More than six million people have had their benefits stopped since April 2000, although the government says the number fell last year. Those claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment Support Allowance (ESA) can have their payments stopped for up to four weeks for a first offence - such as not being available for work. Earlier this month a report by the homeless charity Crisis found there was a ""postcode lottery"" in the way that sanctions were applied across the UK.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Flooding along River Great Ouse over Christmas to be investigated,"By Alex PopeBBC News, East The Environment Agency (EA) in eastern England said it was working with councils and the emergency services to collect data and information. Flood and coastal risk manager Paul Burrows said it was about ""making us better prepared for next time - as there will be a next time"". A local councillor said ""more could have been done"" to clear the river. Tim Barnard, 68, whose family home in Harrold, Bedfordshire, was flooded in the early hours of Christmas Day, said he did not receive a call alerting him to the dangers. ""A week before Christmas we got a call but on Christmas Day, nothing,"" he said. Mr Barnard said the information he was given by local police at 22:30 GMT on Christmas Eve was ""totally wrong"", as he was told the peak would hit at 06:00 on Boxing Day - but instead water started coming into his house just an hour and a half later. He said the ""state of the river"" was not good enough and that landowners, whose responsibility it is to clear the rivers, ""need to be policed by the Environment Agency"". He predicted the cost to repair his damaged home was about £180,000. Ms Fields, Conservative councillor who represents Harrold on Bedford Borough Council, said: ""There is more the Environment Agency could have done to have kept the rivers clear and I want an explanation why Harrold didn't get any warnings."" Mr Burrows, for the EA, said the counties of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, had the last ""big floods"" in Easter 1998 when ""many hundreds"" of homes were flooded. This time about 200 homes flooded, but due to improved defences 4,000 others were protected along the River Great Ouse catchment, he said. ""We have lots of good information and lots of rumour and myth, so we need to sort that all out,"" he said. Mr Burrows said the EA would look into the flood warnings, saying: ""We need to do a validation process - were they accurate, were they timely and are there any improvements that can be made?"" River repairs would be undertaken by the EA along with clearing any blockages that may have caused a flood risk, he said. The removal of debris is the responsibility landowners either side of the river, but the EA has ""permissive powers to do maintenance over 112km [70 miles] of the Great Ouse catchment,"" he added.

Deepcut soldier Cheryl James' 'rumour' fears,"Pte Cheryl James had thought people were ""calling her a slag"", former Army trainee Catherine Roberts told the inquest at Woking Coroner's Court. She said Pte James was ""upset"" when she mentioned name-calling in the canteen four weeks before she died. Ms Roberts said: ""As far as I was concerned I did not hear anything about anyone calling her names."" 'Stories going around' She told the hearing: ""She never did say anything about leaving the Army. She never said she did not want to be there any more. ""I recall once she came into the canteen and was upset and stated that people were talking about her, and spoke about people putting rumours around that she was a slapper, which she said she was not - stories going around."" Ms Roberts told the court Pte James had been planning a Christmas shopping trip which showed she was looking to the future. Pte James, 18, of Llangollen, one of four recruits to die at the Army training camp in Surrey over a seven-year period, was found shot dead at the barracks in 1995. 'Believed it was suicide' In a written statement, William Porter, a paramedic with the Surrey Ambulance Service, said he arrived at the wooded area where Pte James' body was found at about 08:55 GMT. He said: ""I remember going up a slope a short distance. It was some woods... and seeing a female in Army uniform. ""I believed that her back was against a fir tree and possibly her knees raised. I could see a wound to the right side of her head. ""I could not see any sign of life. From what I could see I believed it was a suicide,"" Mr Porter said. Insp Timothy Mackie, a MoD police officer, who was a sergeant in 1995, said Pte James' body was lying face down when he arrived at the barracks. He said the undergrowth had been disturbed and the ground was damp, even though it had not been raining. In his written statement, he said: ""The body was face down. I do not remember seeing any wounds or a rifle."" He said he remembered being told by a police inspector as he left the scene that Pte James had a wound to her forehead. Insp Mackie said: ""I remember finding that strange because I could not recall an exit wound."" The hearing was adjourned until Monday. Who were the Deepcut four?

Concorde group meets British Airways over museum bid,"The Save Concorde Group (SCG) said it met the firm on Tuesday to present its plan which would cost £1.5m. Another bid by the Concorde Trust for £2.9m of lottery funding towards a £9m museum has been rejected. The jet was on display in Filton until late 2010 but was closed by Airbus, which has been loaned the jet, so the firm could carry out maintenance. The firm has spent £1.4m repairing Concorde with water leaks a particular problem because it has been left on an open runway since 2003. Ben Lord from SCG said: ""It is vital that not only do we preserve Concorde, but educate our future generations what Concorde symbolises."" Mr Lord added his group has become ""increasingly concerned"" with the Concorde Trust and how they had handled the proposed move to a new museum. ""Following the controversial closure of the temporary museum, it was revealed that the trust were seeking to develop a £9m heritage centre. ""In our opinion [it] was incredibly over exaggerated in terms of cost, and would take an unreasonable amount of time to become open."" A spokesman for the Concorde Trust said it was important that all interested parties worked together to make the Concorde museum a reality. ""The Concorde Trust is happy to work with all stakeholders and to consider any ideas and plans."" Not as glossy The spokesman added that plans must be financially viable and help to conserve the region's aviation heritage. Mr Lord from SCG said the discussions with BA ""went very very well"" and had taken the plans away for discussion with Airbus who are looking after the jet at its Filton base. He said his group's plans were ""not quite as glossy"" as that of Concorde Trust and would see the jet brought under a hangar at a site earmarked for the museum at Cribbs Causeway. He said £840,000 of funding from Airbus, with £300,000 already saved for the museum would be supplemented with funding from commercial sources. The plane - called Concorde 216 or Alpha Foxtrot - was the last of the fleet to fly when Concorde was withdrawn from service by British Airways in 2003 due to increased running costs. The Concorde Trust plans for the museum at Cribbs Causeway were first submitted in 2007 but building work has never started because of a lack of funding. The museum was given a £840,000 cash boost by Airbus last week but has almost £8m still to raise. The jet has been at Filton since 2003 and was closed to the public in October 2010 for maintenance. Filton Airfield, where the jet is based, is to close from the end of 2012, meaning a new home will soon have to be found for the jet.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stain-shedding coating gets tough,"By Jason PalmerScience and technology reporter, BBC News Many such ""super-hydrophobic"" coatings have been made before, but a report in the journal Langmuir describes coated fabrics that are far more durable. The trick was to engineer a multi-layered coating whose layers, when struck with UV light, bond more firmly to each other and to cotton. The technique also may also be put to use in medical antibacterial coatings. Super-hydrophobic surfaces have fascinated scientists for years; they are behind the lotus plant's self-cleaning leaves and the gecko's super-dry and thus super-sticky feet . These surfaces are practically impossible to wet - water beads on them and dirt and particulates do not stick to them, leading to the self-cleaning description. Chemists looking for the next best thing in clothing coatings have tried several tricks in recent years to create a coating with similar properties in the laboratory. The new work hinges on what is known as layer-by-layer self-assembly - basically dipping a fabric into a solution over and over again to deposit multiple layers on it. The team from the Australian Future Fibres Research and Innovation Centre at Deakin University made their solution with tiny particles of silica - the same material as sand. Crucially, they added a few chemical steps to coat the particles with long chemical tails ending in what are known as azido groups. The team found that layered coatings of the azido-treated nanoparticles were, like many previous attempts, not very durable - a stain-free shirt with such a coating would not survive many washes. But baked under a source of UV light, the tails on the particles were made to interlink with one another, forming a far tougher structure within and across the layers. ""This technique is simple, but allows forming an [even] coating on irregular [materials] having a complicated surface structure, and it can precisely control the coating thickness,"" said Tong Lin, lead author of the work. Dr Lin told BBC News that at this stage, the technique is only suited to small samples, but that it is just one of a number of similar approaches in which a self-cleaning surface is desirable. ""We have also used a similar method to apply a soluble antibacterial agent to a three-dimensional tissue scaffold for biomedical applications,"" he explained. ""The coating is stable... but has a strong antibacterial performance; however it does not interfere with cell growth.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
G4S used force on pregnant woman at Cedars centre,"G4S staff at Cedars centre near Gatwick used substantial force with significant risk to the unborn child, the Chief Inspector of Prisons said in a report. Nick Hardwick said it was ""simply not acceptable to initiate force for such purposes"". G4S said its staff were concerned that the woman risked causing herself harm. Cedars pre-departure centre for families, which opened last year, replaced the unit at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire. 'Holding her feet' G4S, which failed to lay on enough security staff for the London 2012 Olympic Games, provides security for the UK Border Agency (UKBA) at the centre, in Pease Pottage, West Sussex. The pregnant woman was given a wheelchair to help her in the departures area. When she resisted ""substantial force"" was used by G4S staff and the wheelchair ""was tipped up with staff holding her feet"". ""At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant,"" the report said. ""There is no safe way to use force against a pregnant woman and to initiate it for the purpose of removal is to take an unacceptable risk."" Force was used against six out of the 39 families, including two children, at the centre, which holds families for up to a week, the report said. 'No safe way' Mr Hardwick said: ""We were very concerned to find that force had been used to effect the removal of a pregnant woman, using non-approved techniques. ""There is no safe way to do this while protecting the unborn child."" The pregnant woman's husband had been disruptive the night before, ""shouting and kicking doors, causing some damage"", the report found. ""At one point it was judged that he had been trying to separate healthcare staff offering to examine his wife to take them hostage,"" the report added. ""Staff were sufficiently concerned by his behaviour to take him to the 'cool down' separation room in full personal protection equipment before his removal."" The cool down room was ""stark and not conducive to helping people calm down"", the inspectors added. Judith Dennis, of the Refugee Council, called for UKBA to heed the report's recommendations, which include that force should only ever be used against pregnant women and children to prevent harm. Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said the welfare of people in its care was its top priority. ""In this incident, our staff were concerned that the woman risked causing herself harm and took the necessary steps to prevent this,"" he said. ""We will be examining how best to take forward the recommendations made following this incident, but it should be noted that the report praises staff for their exceptional level of care and the considerable steps they take to avoid the use of force.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kingfisher to hand back £23m of UK furlough cash,"Second-quarter home improvement sales rose as more people worked from home and looked at fresh ways to use space during the pandemic, Kingfisher said. People in England have been told to work from home if possible after a period of more relaxed restrictions. UK firms have voluntarily returned more than £215m to the government in furlough scheme payments. The coronavirus crisis has badly hit many parts of the economy, but some firms are seeing benefits. Pre-tax profits for the company as a whole jumped more than 62% to £98m in the half year, after a strong second quarter. ""The crisis has prompted more people to rediscover their homes and find pleasure in making them better,"" said Kingfisher chief executive Thierry Garnier. ""It is creating new home improvement needs, as people seek new ways to use space or adjust to working from home."" The crisis also boosted shopping online. Kingfisher's e-commerce sales rose 164% in the first half of the year and now represent 19% of total sales, up from 7% in the same period last year. Bust then boom After Covid-19 hit Kingfisher sales in the first quarter, second-quarter sales made a strong recovery, the company said. The group owns B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and other markets. It said half of its staff were on job retention schemes in the UK, France, Spain and Romania in April, but that had dropped to about 10% by the end of May as Kingfisher reopened stores. Apart from staff who were vulnerable, all employees had returned to work by 1 July, Kingfisher said. Over the six months to 31 July, the group claimed £55m in state aid in its different markets, including the £23m it intends to repay in the UK. However, a spokesman for the group said the situation in France was ""very different"" and that profit had been hit by an extended period of lockdown. Furlough money UK firms have voluntarily returned millions of pounds to the government in furlough scheme payments they did not need or took in error. More than 80,400 employers have returned cash they were given to help cover workers' salaries, according to HMRC figures. But the money that has been returned is a tiny part of the £35.4bn claimed under the scheme up until 16 August. Officials believe £3.5bn may have been paid out in error or to fraudsters. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - or furlough scheme - workers placed on leave have received 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. At first, this was all paid for by the government, but firms are now having to make a contribution to wages as well.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dale Farm: Basildon Council considering further action,"By Julian SturdyInside Out East It is a year since Dale Farm, Europe's largest illegal traveller site, was stormed by hundreds of riot police. The cost of the operation was £7.2m and about 80 families were moved from the land. Caravans were prevented from returning to the site by earth banks and a court injunction. However, more than 100 travellers simply camped in a private access road, just yards from their former homes. Others have moved on to legal plots elsewhere on the site, in breach of their licences. 'Spend what it takes' Basildon Council leader Tony Ball has denied the operation was a failure, saying he could not turn a blind eye to law-breaking. ""I am prepared to spend what it takes for people to comply with the law,"" he told BBC Inside Out East. ""I wouldn't say it is an open cheque book, but I am saying what is more important is that the law is upheld and it is up to the local authority to apply that law."" Kathleen McCarthy is one of the travellers ignoring a new eviction notice and continuing to break the law. ""I don't think it is out of stubbornness because being stubborn isn't going to help anything,"" she said. ""The reason we are still here is that we are still living in the hope that there might be a site built. After spending £7m they might think to themselves what further can we do, we got them two or three feet."" Travellers complain they face a bleak winter camped in the lane, with deteriorating sanitation and sickness. The British Red Cross is acting as an intermediary in negotiations with Basildon Council. 'Significant concerns' Humanitarian officer Ben Stickley said: ""We still have significant concerns about conditions, illness, kids playing in what is a very dangerous environment. ""There is plenty we can do to make a difference,"" he said. ""We very much would like to keep working with the residents and the council to really try to resolve those as best we possibly can."" Residents living in nearby Crays Hill, who have complained about breaches of planning law at Dale Farm for the past 10 years, have said the travellers are taking advantage of the legal system. Basildon Council says it will return the illegally-developed land, which is still owned by the travellers, back to the green belt. So far it has been unable to recoup any costs from the travellers. Soon the council is expected to decide whether to send in the bailiffs again, or seek further injunctions against those camped in the access road. For now, the stand-off at Dale Farm continues. Dale Farm, a year on, is on BBC1 in the eastern region on Monday at 19:30 BST.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Twitch: Streamers call for a blackout to recognise victims of sexual and racial abuses,"By Steffan PowellNewsbeat gaming reporter They're calling for a blackout because they think the streaming site can do more to recognise victims of sexual and racial abuse. Dozens of women have recently claimed they have been sexually assaulted by people in the gaming industry. Twitch says it takes accusations of sexual harassment seriously. Streamers are arguing Twitch has not acted quickly enough when there have been sexual assault claims made against some of its content creators. Some also think the site has been too lenient when others have been accused of using racist or homophobic language. Encouraging people to stay off the platform for a day could deprive Twitch of viewers and income. Those supporting the blackout think it will lead to Twitch taking these issues more seriously as they feel like the site has not talked to them enough about their concerns. After many claims of sexual harassment in the gaming industry were reported, Twitch posted to say it was actively looking into cases linked to their affiliated streamers. It also praised the bravery of those who've spoken out. Stephanie Ijoma is a streamer who also founded NNESAGA - a UK gaming platform that helps promote diverse voices. ""Me being a black woman especially, I've never felt safe in such a toxic environment. We're supposed to be playing and connecting with others and we can't do that if the space that we're in isn't well protected."" ""Twitch is the biggest platform for gamers to express themselves, showcase their talents and connect with their community. How can we do that on a platform when it's not looking out for us? When there is so much sexism going on, racism, abuse and sexual harassment?"" She believes the blackout has got the attention of Twitch bosses. ""They need to hire more diverse people to help bring down the discrimination, the bottom line is we need to trust Twitch again."" The CEO of the company Emmet Shear sent an internal email saying he's looking at banning accounts based on their historical behaviour. He also said he wants Twitch to become the safest place for people to create content on the internet. The calls for a blackout haven't been universally supported. Some content creators are arguing not streaming for a day is counterproductive. They say it's an opportunity lost to discuss issues of harassment, consent and racism with their communities. Some content creators have contacted Newsbeat to say they're worried the campaign was rushed and as a result many streamers are carrying on as normal today. For many of those following the blackout, the hope is this is the beginning of a much wider discussion about people's behaviour on Twitch and in the gaming industry.

Sir Keir Starmer: Labour has 'duty' to tackle anti-Semitism,"The shadow Brexit secretary said three peers who quit the party on Tuesday over the issue were ""not alone"". But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was up to Labour to make changes so party members ""feel they can return with confidence"". A BBC Panorama programme into accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour will be aired tonight on BBC One. Lord Triesman, Lord Darzi and Lord Turnberg all resigned the whip citing accusations of anti-Semitism within Labour. Lord Triesman - the general secretary of the Labour Party for two years under Tony Blair - accused the party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and ""his circle"" of being anti-Semitic. And he said they had ""never once made the right judgement call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice"". A Labour spokeswoman said it ""completely rejects these false and offensive claims"". She added that, at ""all levels"", the party was ""implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society"". Sir Keir said he was sad to see the resignations, but it ""reinforces the sense of duty"" he has for the party to do everything it can to tackle anti-Semitism within its ranks. He admitted that it was not just these three peers, but members across the country who were leaving for the same reason. ""It is very easy for people in leadership positions across the shadow cabinet, like me, to try and duck responsibility,"" he told Today. ""But we have all got a responsibility, a collective responsibility, and I think we have got to take decisive action."" 'We have got to be open' Sir Keir said he backed bringing in an automatic expulsion rule in ""clear cases of anti-Semitism"" - mirroring what the party does when a member supports another political party at an election. He also said those who denied there was a problem were ""part of the problem"". The party is currently being investigated by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission after a number of complaints about anti-Semitism. Sir Keir said Labour should ""throw open the books, say you have got access to anything [and] access to any members of staff"" during the probe, and tell the watchdog: ""We have still got a problem, help us through this."" He added: ""Many organisations circle the wagons when they are challenged and that is the wrong approach. We have got to be very, very open.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Should we lose civil liberties for national security?,"John HessPolitical editor, East Midlands Talha Asmal, from West Yorkshire, was photographed posing for Islamic State before blowing himself up at an Iraqi oil refinery. At 17, he became the country's youngest suicide bomber. But why and how are some young Britons being radicalised to become jihadists, thus venturing into this foreign war? It's also a question the government is wrestling with. The Prime Minister raised the issue at a summit of European leaders. One approach to help combat Islamic radicalism is reaching out into the classroom. On the outskirts of Nottingham, Impero, a software design business, is waging its own war against the grooming of vulnerable school children by extremists. Sally-Anne Griffiths, a former teacher, has helped design software that warns schools their pupils are looking at jihadist websites. She said: ""The software allows our schools to monitor the computers used by pupils for key words or phrases that may give cause for concern."" It logs dozens of extremist words and phrases such as ""jihadi bride"" or ""Yodo,"" short for you only die once. The software is being piloted at a network of schools, including two in Leicester. It coincides with the Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015, which comes into force in July. George Osborne told MPs: ""We want to work with schools, mosques and other community institutions to help prevent radicalisation and there's a new statutory duty to do that."" But the repercussions of this latest piece of legislation alarms some teachers. Peter Flack, of the National Union of Teachers in Leicester, said: ""We need to demonstrate to these young people that we respect them and care about them. ""We need to show that we value their views and talk to them and help. ""You can't do that if you are simply looking at control and suppression."" But Ms Griffiths said it was not about spying on children and more about safeguarding them. She said: ""It might just flag up an early warning that this child might be vulnerable. For the teachers, it helps them ask 'let's see if we need to intervene and get some counter-narrative'."" But is there a civil liberties issue here? Nottinghamshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping has a robust response. He said: ""I'm sure there's a civil liberties concern. It's a big issue. ""But ultimately, we've got to make some tough choices. Do we want young people to go abroad engaging in terrorist activity. We need safeguards on access to some websites and good advice to schools and teachers. ""If we can avoid the harrowing experiences that are taking place, it's got to be the right thing to do."" Under the new act, schools will have ""a duty of care"" to safeguard pupils tempted to access jihadist social media. The issues boil down to safeguarding national security or further squeezing civil liberties. The war against Islamic extremism - even in our schools - is challenging some basic British freedoms.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Open prison Hollesley Bay has 'quarter of inmates' infected,"More than 100 inmates and 25 staff at HMP Hollesley Bay in Suffolk are ill or off work, it said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had put in place ""precautionary measures"" at the jail. ""Our priority is to limit the spread of the virus and protect the lives of those who live and work in our prisons,"" an MoJ spokeswoman said. Latest government statistics showed the Rendlesham, Orford and Hollesley area had a case rate of 1,030.5 per 100,00 people in the week to 14 January. The number of cases in the area was up by 77 to 118 in that week. Rates and the number of cases in the wider East Suffolk district fell in the same period. The MoJ would be ""monitoring the situation"" at the jail, which has capacity for 485 prisoners. Jackie Marshall, of the POA, which represents staff, said: ""Around the country we've got staff off everywhere and it's proving to be very difficult for some establishments."" She added wardens were trying to look after sick inmates ""but we're not trained to do that"". ""They're just trying to do the best they can to keep as many people safe, including themselves and their families,"" she added. Ms Marshall said the prison service did a really good job in the first wave of coronavirus in March. ""Because the second wave is spreading so fast, they are struggling with it,"" she said. Inmates at the jail are normally allowed to spend time outside the prison before release, although current lockdown restrictions prevent this. This can take the form of daily visits within the local community, weekly with family, or monthly when men can go home for up to four nights. The POA said there were a smaller number of Covid cases among residents at Warren Hill secure jail, located next to Hollesley Bay. Highpoint Prison near Newmarket is understood to be coming out of a Covid-19 outbreak, but some 50 staff were still off work due to coronavirus or other conditions, the POA said. Covid vaccinations for inmates and jail staff in England are expected start rolling out from today according to the POA. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

"TSB chaos: 'We are on our knees,' says boss","By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter The bank has been forced to call in outside help to help fix the banking system breakdown. Mr Pester, said he would take direct control of the issue, and had drafted in experts from IBM, who would report ""directly"" to him. He also promised no customer would pay overdraft fees or charges for April. The problems arose last Friday when the bank attempted to move customers' accounts from former owner Lloyds to a platform, newly built, by its Spanish-owner Sabadell. But since the migration began, around half of TSB's customers have been unable to access their online accounts. Asked by the BBC if he would give up his bonus for this year, Mr Pester said: ""The last thing I'm worried about is bonuses and pay."" When asked if he would resign over the issues, he responded: ""I haven't even had time to think about it"". A TSB manager's tale of woe The BBC has spoken to a fed-up TSB branch manager who made it clear that it's not just customers who are suffering. ""Multiple staff members have been sent home physically and emotionally exhausted."" ""In my branch, every member of staff has been in tears and all saying this has been the worst working experience of their lives."" ""It is heartbreaking for me as a manager seeing my amazing team break down one by one."" ""I am desperate for chief executive Paul Pester to recognise how awful it is in the branches."" Read the full story No penny-pinching The BBC asked Mr Pester what sort of expenses TSB customers could be compensated for. He was told about Phil, a tiler who has lost £2,000 worth of business because he could not pay contractors. Do people like him have a case for compensation? ""Of course they do,"" said Mr Pester. ""We will work through what we think and he thinks is reasonable. He added: ""TSB has caused this problem, we should be able to provide a service to our customers, and we haven't. ""The last thing we are going to be doing is penny-pinching when we are dealing with an issue with our customers."" However, despite Mr Pester's attempts at reassurance, exasperated TSB customers have continued to vent their fury on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How Perrie from Little Mix is helping me learn to love my freckles,"By Christian Hewgill & Bela ShahBBC Newsbeat reporters The Little Mix star, 25, told her Instagram followers she used to hide them but now wants to embrace them. Gianna Holmes, 22, says having freckles has impacted on her confidence but Perri's post ""definitely helps me"". Her twin Daniela, who also has freckles, says she's ""proud"" of the singer for sharing her photo and hopes it can help her sister's insecurities. Gianna and Daniela both have freckles on their arms, face, chest and legs. ""I'm not too keen on them and not too confident about having them,"" Gianna told Newsbeat. ""I see myself differently to everyone else and compare myself to everyone who doesn't have freckles. ""I'm always trying to cover them up with foundation, concealer and everything else."" Daniela on the other hand says she's never had a problem with freckles, but thinks Perrie's post is really important. ""I instantly sent it to Gianna as soon as I saw it, saying it could help with her insecurities about them, and help her feel positive, happy and embrace them. ""We also had friends and family tagging us in the picture as they know how Gianna feels. I'm very proud of Perrie for putting it on Instagram."" Lizzie Mawson is a model. She thinks Perrie sharing the post with her 8.2 million followers is important. ""So many of those followers will be young girls going through high school struggling with their appearance and body image issues. ""Freckles are a feature that don't get talked about enough. It's so easy for bullies to pick on things that seem rare or different. ""Perrie posting this will give young girls and boys the confidence to not cover them up with an inch of foundation."" Lizzie's thoughts are echoed by Nicholas Sinclair, 22, who's also a model. ""It's like they're a commodity now: Freckles are in. ""The industry has changed my views on freckles, and now I see it more as art and something to embrace, rather than a 'what's that' sort of thing."" 'Something positive' Gianna says Perrie has inspired her to try and change her relationship with her freckles. ""It's definitely something positive and something to embrace. I need to stop caring so much. ""It's something that will come in time, I'm having to care less each time, it'll come. ""But seeing Perrie putting it out there definitely helps me as well as a lot of young women who aren't so keen on them."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Meningitis death girl Izzy Gentry 'not given a chance',"Isabel Gentry, 16, was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary after falling ill on 18 May and discharged four hours later. Her mother Claire Booty said an initial assessment was ""cursory and brief"" and she ""could hardly walk"" when sent home. In a review after the teenager's death, the NHS Foundation Trust said her treatment was ""appropriate"". Isabel, who was known as Izzy, had been revising for exams when she started to feel unwell on 18 May. She was taken to hospital, by ambulance, at 01:00 GMT but was sent home at 05:00. Ms Booty told the inquest, the hospital had said her daughter had a ""viral infection of the stomach"". Avon Coroner's Court heard the teenager ""could hardly walk to the car"" when they left the hospital after the initial assessment. Ms Booty said: ""Izzy said 'Mum, I can't believe they're sending me home, I feel so ill'. She was not given a chance."" Doctors 'distracted' The court heard there had been a possible case of meningitis at her school, St Brendan's Sixth Form College in Bristol, a couple of weeks earlier and all students had been given leaflets explaining the symptoms. Her mother said Izzy had the very symptoms described in the leaflet. Paramedic Gary White, who was called out on 18 May, said he had been told the patient might have meningitis but said he ""couldn't detect any major symptoms such as a rash or photophobia"". Ms Booty said her daughter ""kept asking for the lights to be turned down"" in the hospital treatment room. She also said doctors ""seemed to be distracted by another patient who was causing disruption at the emergency department"". The inquest heard that Izzy deteriorated over the day and another ambulance was called which took her back to the hospital at 17:30. The consultant who treated Izzy diagnosed meningitis and told Ms Booty her daughter was ""very seriously ill"". Ms Booty told the court the doctor ""couldn't believe she'd been sent home initially"". The next day an MRI scan detected Izzy's brain was swelling and she died, on 20 May, 48 hours after being initially discharged from Bristol Royal Infirmary. The inquest is expected to last five days and will hear from paramedics, nurses and doctors from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Queen stars launch 'moving' exhibition,"By Elizabeth AlkerMusic reporter, BBC 6 Music ""There are things I have forgotten,"" said Taylor at the launch of Stormtroopers In Stilettos - which covers Queen's formative years. The musician added that many of the exhibits reminded him of the band's late frontman Freddie Mercury. The exhibition runs until 12 March at the Old Truman Brewery in east London. Themed rooms in the exhibition space - documenting Queen's journey to fame - are dedicated to the band's first albums and feature artwork, costumes made by British designer Zandra Rhodes and the band's instruments, plus a recreation of the studio in which Bohemian Rhapsody was recorded. It also features video footage, interviews and photographs. Record release ""It's quite shocking for us to suddenly bring back what happened all those years ago in such vivid detail,"" said drummer Taylor. Brian May hopes it will be an inspiration to visitors, especially if they are musicians starting out as Queen once did. ""Once you come into this exhibition you realise that we were just boys and we got together with a dream. We worked night and day for many years and we were very lucky,"" said the veteran guitarist. May and Taylor also hope the exhibition captures the importance of their style over image. ""You don't buy in your style - it comes from inside you and it's very organic,"" said May. ""I think that is a lesson to people to have belief in your vision."" The 40th anniversary of the band is also marked this weekend with the release of a two-track single, also entitled Stormtroopers In Stilettos. It features previously unreleased versions of early Queen tracks Keep Yourself Alive (Long Lost Retake) and Stone Cold Crazy (2011 Remaster). ""These are tracks recorded before we even had a recording deal, just the four of us and an engineer at De Lane Lea studios,"" said May. ""A lot of people are already saying they sound better than the first album because they're more organic, more natural and have a better feel. People will have a real chance to hear us for the first time before we signed the first deal,"" he added. Stormtroopers In Stilettos is open until 12 March at the Old Truman Brewery.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK tax evasion action hunt identifies 100 individuals,"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said some of these were already under investigation for tax evasion. It said it has obtained large quantities of documents which reveal those, along with professional advisers, who may be involved. Evasion is illegal, tax avoidance is not. The hunt was sparked by a joint investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme, the Guardian newspaper and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. HMRC is working on the material, which it describes as 400 gigabytes of data, with the tax authorities in the United States and Australia. So far HMRC has pinpointed more than 100 people from the information, who it says benefited from using offshore havens such as Singapore, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and the Cook Islands to hide their assets. More than 200 UK accountants, lawyers and other professional advisers will also be scrutinised. HMRC refused to disclose where the documents came from, but an official suggested they constituted the largest haul of offshore tax evasion data obtained so far. Tax evaders risk being charged fines equivalent to 200% of the amount of tax they should have paid. 'Weapon' The Chancellor, George Osborne, said: ""The message is simple: if you evade tax, we're coming after you. ""This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal."" Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the ACCA accountancy body, said that it was still a small number of people who were evading tax in these markets. ""The majority of accountants, lawyers and other professional advisers, as well as their clients, are not breaking any laws in these locations. There is a large gulf between what amounts to tax avoidance, which is within the law, and tax evasion, which is illegal,"" he said. ""While this joint initiative with the US and Australian authorities is a positive step from HMRC, the Cayman Islands, Cook Islands and other offshore jurisdictions targeted are not going to suddenly lose their tax friendly status by this move. This is a crackdown on evasion and these locations will remain hot spots for individuals seeking to reduce their tax bill within the perimeters of the law."" Last week, Bermuda and other British overseas territories with financial centres signed agreements on sharing tax information. The move follows similar recent deals with Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. The action is aimed at tracking down banking clients who escape paying taxes by hiding their money overseas. An international drive against tax evasion and the use of tax havens has been picking up steam.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How did it go so wrong for Govia Thameslink?,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter After all the grand talk of a great new timetable and 400 new trains, and more seats, commuters have been reduced to turning up at the station and hoping for the best. Is this really acceptable? Can anyone say it went well? Most of the commuters work for businesses that go through transition and plan and compromise accordingly. That has clearly not happened here and, somewhere, errors have obviously been made. Many people are ending up with worse services than before but paying the same price. How is that reasonable ? The Department for Transport (DfT) which employs Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on a management contract has been strangely quiet. Commuters failed Questions will inevitably be asked of them. Is there a coherent oversight over these complex changes? Commuters would say not. GTR - which runs Southern, Thameslink Great Northern and Gatwick Express - has talked the talk but failed abysmally at running anything near the required service. What really irks passengers is they were only told a new reduced timetable would be introduced on Tuesday. Why was that left so late? There have not been enough route-trained drivers for the launch of this timetable and planning has clearly failed. For most passengers that is staggering. Politically, it is no wonder the calls for renationalisation grow stronger. The current system of a mix of public and a large private company has failed commuters. Accountability has become diluted. On what should have been its proudest hour and the delivery of Thameslink, the rail industry in this incarnation couldn't get it to work. And this could last for weeks. Update: The Dft has been in touch and says it hasn't been quiet. In fact, the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling addressed the house yesterday: ""What we have seen in the last few days has not been good enough. No one should underestimate the logistical challenge of introducing a timetable change. ""The changes have been made for a very good reason: they mean a big expansion of services across the country. A timetable change of such a scale involves reorganising staff rotas, training staff for new routes, and reorganising how we deploy our trains. ""It needed months of preparation, and I am afraid that a number of things went wrong, but most particularly the fact that for the second time in six months, Network Rail was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and left the rest of the industry struggling to catch up. ""I am not happy with that at all and I have told the leadership of Network Rail that it cannot happen again.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Portland homes evacuated as sirens sound for first time,"The area around Chiswell was abandoned by many as the warning signal sounded at about 22:30 GMT. The west-facing stretch of Dorset coast was the subject of a severe flood warning - now downgraded - after tides peaked again at 10:15 GMT on Tuesday. Poole's Twin Sails bridge was also affected by adverse weather, after a steel totem was blown loose. Borough of Poole Council said the damage was caused by the high winds. The spokesman added: ""As a crane is being used to support the totem, we have temporarily closed one lane to traffic while these works are being carried out."" The four 7-metre (22ft 11in) high curved stainless steel totems house the bridge's safety barriers, warning lights and operating systems. The severe flood warnings at Chiswell and Preston Beach in Lodmoor, and for Iford Bridge, near Christchurch, have been downgraded. Following the siren sound in Chiswell, residents were told to evacuate their homes or move to upstairs rooms facing away from the sea. Some took refuge in the The Heights Hotel. The Environment Agency (EA) said it was the first time the siren had sounded ""for real"", and not during a test, since one was installed on the island more than 30 years ago. 'Amazing experience' Jackie Breakspear, landlady of the Cove House Inn at Chiswell, said: ""We had the police, coastguard and the Environment Agency here but we knew we were in trouble when the flood warning alarm went and everybody left, including the police, and left us to it. ""Watching everybody empty out of the car park - we knew we were on our own. We were warned that anybody left in the pub had to come upstairs. ""We knew it was going to be bad. The sea just came over, battering the shutters, water was pouring in, but no water actually came into the pub at all - so we were very lucky. ""It was an amazing experience - to watch it was fantastic."" A rock stack off the coast, known locally as Pom Pom rock, has been washed away, according to locals. Local historian Stuart Morris, who photographed the rock before and after its collapse, said: ""You are talking about a natural stack that was hundreds of tonnes, totally demolished and broken to pieces by the storm. ""One thing that Portlanders love is a really spectacular storm."" Bournemouth Borough Council said it expected the severe flood warning for Iford to be lifted later but residents evacuated from the mobile home park have been advised not to return until the all clear has been given.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Are these north Wales hills sitting on a gold mine?,"By Nick BourneBBC News Experts think there's potential for a gold rush in north Wales as Alba Mineral Resources is carrying out research across a 20-mile (32km) area known as the Dolgellau gold belt in Gwynedd. A survey has been conducted around the site of Clogau St David's gold mine at Bontddu, Dolgellau, which shut in 1989. Boss George Frangeskides said the plan is to seek permission to open the mine. The company has acquired a 90% stake in Gold Mines of Wales, which has permission from the Crown to prospect and mine in the area as they search for new sites. It is not the only firm hoping to restart gold mining in north Wales. Welsh gold jewellery firm Clogau, whose founders once owned Clogau St David's, bought the area's last gold mine, Gwynfynydd, in 2016, 17 years after it ceased production. But managing director Ben Roberts admitted any plans for the former mine could take years to come to fruition. The area was the focus of a gold rush more than 150 years ago, but records suggest gold mining goes back to Roman times. There are about 300 old mine workings across the gold belt, according to Alba's technical director Howard Baker. ""We have just completed the first geochemical soil sampling programme over the [Clogau St David's] mine area,"" he said. ""We have identified the potential of new areas that warrant further exploration. ""The work we are doing is quite groundbreaking for the Dolgellau gold belt. No modern day exploration has taken place."" Sitting on a gold mine As a boy, Ben Roberts and his siblings would accompany their father, Bill, into Clogau St David's, to learn about the family's gold mine. Mr Roberts Sr, chairman of Clogau, bought the closed mine with a view to turning it into a tourist attraction. But he turned to small scale mining when that fell through, producing Welsh gold the jewellery business still uses to this day. ""We are very keen to do the same with Gwynfynydd [mine],"" said his son. The area's gold mines shut when extraction cost more than the gold being produced. Currently, the price of gold is trading about five times higher than it was 20 years ago and, on top of that, Welsh rose gold sells at a premium, according to Mr Frangeskides, making it an attractive prospect. ""This is a two-pronged process we are engaged in - one is trying to bring the Clogau gold mine... back into production. ""And, at the same time... we are looking at the regional gold exploration of the Dolgellau gold belt."" The next stage will be to submit an application to the planning authority, he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India mango farmers angry at dump plan,"By Ram Dutt TripathiBBC News, Lucknow They say the planned dump in the state of Uttar Pradesh will mean that 300 trucks a day will pass through the village of Dasheri. The village is home to the world famous Dasheri mango and allegedly has India's oldest mango tree. Mangoes from this area near the state capital Lucknow are exported worldwide. Noxious gasses They are reputed to be the tastiest in India and are the main source of income for thousands of farmers in this region. The plans have been put forward even though last year the whole of the region was declared a ""fruit belt"" to protect mango trees from brick kilns and other hazardous industries. Unions have now organised a protest against local government plans to go ahead with the landfill site, which will consist of 90 acres of land close to Dasheri village. ""We will not allow the government to acquire our fertile land and mango trees to build a solid waste management plant,"" said local union leader Harinam Singh. The protesters say that pollution caused by lorries dumping rubbish combined with noxious gasses from the dump itself will harm mango crops and cause them respiratory difficulties. They say that the air quality will be so poor that the country's oldest mango tree - believed to be nearly 300 years old and referred to as a ""mother plant"" by experts - will be threatened. Dasheri village panchayat (council) Jaswant Singh said: ""The government should build the garbage dump on some other waste land. ""We will not give our fertile land for this purpose. We have the original mother plant of the Dasheri mango and we are not willing to give our land up at any cost."" The villagers have pledged to hold a series of demonstrations against the plans outside the offices of the Lucknow Development Authority which selected the village for a ""modern, solid waste management plant"". The state government has issued a public notice to acquire the 90 acres near Dasheri and two other nearby villages. Most of the waste will come from Lucknow city. Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma argued that the decision to acquire land near Dasheri was taken by the state's Bahujan Samaj Party-government led by Ms Mayawati. Mr Sharma said that the municipal corporation ""has not been taken into confidence on this issue"". He has written letters to the government to reconsider its decision and shift the garbage dump to some other location.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ari Fuld killing: $1m raised for family by crowdfunders,"It was set up after Ari Fuld was stabbed to death at a shopping centre in the Jewish settlement bloc of Etzion in the occupied West Bank. Mr Fuld, who had a large social media following, managed to shoot his attacker before dying from his wounds. A 17-year-old Palestinian was arrested in connection with the killing. Mr Fuld, 45, is the latest among dozens of Israelis to have been killed in stabbings, shootings and car-rammings, predominantly by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since late 2015. Some 300 Palestinians - most of them attackers, Israel says - have also been killed by Israeli security forces in that period, according to news agencies. Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation. 'America grieves' Ari Fuld was a prominent activist, known, amongst other things, for defending Israel and sharing his thoughts on religious topics in online videos. He was due to undertake a speaking tour in the United States in the coming weeks. The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who attended Mr Fuld's funeral, tweeted that ""America grieves as one of its citizens was brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist"". While no group said it was behind the attack, a spokesman for the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, praised the killing as a ""natural response to Israeli crimes against Palestinians"". Last Sunday's attack occurred near the Gush Etzion Junction - a roundabout where Israelis and Palestinians constantly cross paths and where dozens of attacks have taken place in recent years. Video on social media appears to show a man being pursued by several people with pistols and shot moments after he allegedly stabbed Mr Fuld. The suspect, identified as Khalil Yusef Ali Jabarin, from the village of Yatta near Hebron, was injured and taken to hospital. Mr Fuld, from the settlement of Efrat, was the father of four children. The GoFundMe page set up in his memory described him as a ""Fallen Lion"". More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. There are also some 100 outposts - small settlements built without the government's authorisation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google Android phone shipments increase by 886%,"Statistics from research firm Canalys suggest that shipments have increased 886% year-on-year from the second quarter of 2009. Apple showed the second largest growth in the smartphone sector with 61% growth in the same period. Overall, the smartphone sector grew by 64% from the second quarter 2009 to the second quarter 2010, the research says. Pete Cunningham, an analyst at Canalys, said Android's sales were in part due to recent launches of ""highly compelling"" phones. ""We're really seeing major vendors getting behind the platform,"" he said. In particular, he said, large manufacturers such as HTC, Samsung and Sony Ericsson, all used the platform and had helped drive shipments. In turn, said Mr Cunningham, shipments would mean sales and market share. ""Typically over a year, the two pretty much balance out,"" he said. The most popular platform during the period was Symbian, commonly found on Nokia and some Sony Ericsson phones. The Symbian Foundation recently made its code open source meaning that any organisation or individual can use and modify the platform's underlying source code. Although it is consistently the most popular smart phone operating system, it is often overshadowed by Apple's iPhone and Google Android operating system. ""It is a mass market platform,"" said Mr Cunningham of Symbian. He said firms such as Nokia were increasingly switching to other platforms to compete with the two popular platforms. In particular, the firm had recently launched Meego, along with chip-maker Intel. ""It is going to use Meego to challenge Apple and Android at the top end of the market,"" he said. The firm's Anssi Vanjoki recently admitted that Nokia had lost mindshare and needed to ""fight back"". ""There is no denying, that as a challenger now, we have a fight on our hands,"" he wrote in a blog. Mr Cunningham said that ""you can never write Nokia off"". ""They are still the market leader,"" he said. The iPhone saw the second largest growth during the period, despite recent high-profile problems with the most newly-launched iPhone 4. The firm recently offered customers a free case for their phone to mitigate a problem in which phone signal strength was drained when the phone was held a certain way. Microsoft was the only firm to see a drop in shipments during the period. Its current platform - Windows Mobile 6.5 - is a ""discontinued platform"" according to Mr Cunningham. ""Nobody is going to use that when Windows Phone 7 is out in the fourth quarter [of 2010],"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid in Scotland: Hundreds hit with Covid fines over new year,"A total of 326 fixed penalties were handed out between 28 December and 3 January, while a further 21 people were arrested over the same period. Indoor gatherings were prohibited and outside socialising limited under the rules in place across much of the country at the time. Tough new ""stay at home"" restrictions are now in place. Police Scotland has said formal enforcement would only be used as a last resort. This is similar to its approach during the first lockdown in March. Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said he was confident a ""collective effort"" in complying with the latest Covid laws will continue. He said: ""We fully recognise the impact these further restrictions will have on people's lives. ""We will have an increased visible presence of police officers in communities to support people and educate them on what the new regulations are. ""It has been astounding when you look at the level of restrictions and the sacrifice people have made that we have not seen an increase in the number of people not willing to comply."" But DCC Graham said the force ""would not hesitate"" to take enforcement action on the small number of people not sticking to the rules. Covid fines start at £30, doubling to £60 if they are not paid within 28 days. Repeat offenders can face fines of up to £960. The number of people fined over new year was down slightly on the previous week (341 people were issued with fixed penalty notices between 16 and 27 December, while 18 were arrested). The majority of Scots heeded warnings to hold Hogmanay celebrations at home with household members. However, a breakdown of the Police Scotland data shows that - in addition to the arrests and fines - hundreds of people across the country were asked to disperse by officers on 31 December and 1 January. A total of 858 people were asked to disperse in this period, including seven who were dispersed using ""reasonable force"". Hundreds of people sang and danced at at Edinburgh Castle to see in the new year before dispersing when several police vans and cars appeared. Another police enforcement action came against a group who gathered at a rented property in Aberfoyle during the festive period. Police Scotland confirmed that 32 people were charged with culpable and reckless conduct in relation to this incident on on 27 December.

Covid: Wales-wide lockdown questioned by Tories,"By Felicity EvansPolitical editor, Wales From 28 December, people will be told to stay home, with all but essential shops closed in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. But a number of Welsh Tories have said nationwide rules are ""disproportionate"" in areas with low infection rates. Mental Health Minister Eluned Morgan said Wales needs to start the post-Christmas lockdown ""as one nation"". However ministers have conceded that some regional variations may be possible in the future. The backbenchers asked for evidence to support the all-Wales approach when they say infection rates ""are vastly different among regions"". It comes after the rules over Christmas were tightened, with non-essential shops to close at 18:00 GMT on Christmas Eve, hospitality at the same time 24 hours later and level four restrictions imposed from December 28. Between 23-27 December two households, plus a single-person household, can meet for the festive period and people can travel to visit family elsewhere in the UK, where up to three households can meet. Political leaders across the UK are urging people to show restraint and meet fewer households than the rules allow, for shorter periods of time. The Tory MPs say in their letter many of their constituents feel Mark Drakeford's decisions are ""disproportionate"" in many parts of Wales. They added: ""The measures will have a devastating impact in several ways, and will ultimately prove futile, having caused needless societal and economic harm."" They go on to say previous requests for evidence supporting Welsh Government decision-making have been met with ""obfuscation, diversion and delay"". They acknowledge ministers have to make challenging decisions but claim the measures drawn up in Wales ""do not appear evidenced, proportionate or consistent, even within our own borders"". Mr Drakeford has previously stated there could be regional or localised differences in the future, if the evidence points to sustained differences between areas. Ms Morgan told the Welsh Government's daily news briefing that Wales needs to start the post-Christmas lockdown ""as one nation"" with the same rules. ""It's absolutely right that we look at places like Anglesey and Conwy where the virus levels are low, but for the time being we are absolutely determined to make sure we go into these restrictions as one nation,"" she said. ""It may be later that we think about phasing coming out at different levels but that depends on how the virus behaves in the next few weeks."" She added that we were ""all inter-dependent as a nation"" with the virus likely to move between areas.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits,"Aurora, founded in 2017, said the deal will help it ""accelerate"" its mission to make self-driving cars a reality. Uber will invest $400m in the Amazon-backed company, giving it a 26% stake. Its chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also serve on Aurora's board, following closure of the deal. Despite the sale of its driverless car subsidiary known as Advanced Technologies Group, Uber said it remained interested in the sector, with plans to collaborate with Aurora when it comes to launching driverless cars on its network. ""Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people's lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation as self-driving vehicles,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""For the last five years, our phenomenal team ... has been at the forefront of this effort - and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster."" Push to profitability Developing driverless technology was a key priority when Uber's founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was leading the ride hailing firm, since he saw it as a way to reduce costs. But the programme hit setbacks after one of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company. The driverless car unit was also tangled up in legal fights over allegations of technology theft. Mr Khosrowshahi, who replaced Mr Kalanick as the boss of Uber in 2017, has refocused the firm on taxi and food delivery services as he pushes to make Uber profitable. The deal with Aurora values Uber's Advanced Technologies Group at roughly $4bn, down from the $7.5bn it was estimated to be worth last year, according to Reuters. It is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2021, Uber said. Aurora, led by veterans of driverless car efforts at Google and Uber, says it has previously received ""significant investment"" from Amazon, which is known to be exploring the possibility of driverless delivery vehicles.

Speculation about her pregnancy surfaced in April when she postponed her 'Unbreakable' tour, saying she wanted to focus on planning a family with her husband, Wissam al-Mana. She was recently spotted in London shopping for baby essentials. The People magazine quoted a source close to the Jackson family as saying: ""She is super excited about her pregnancy and is doing extremely well. She actually feels very good about everything."" In a video posted on Twitter in April, she told her fans that she was postponing her world tour because ""there's been a sudden change"". ""I thought it was important that you be the first to know. My husband and I are planning our family,"" she said, adding: ""Please if you can try and understand that its important that I do this now."" She went on to say: ""I have to rest up, doctor's orders."" Older parents with young kids The 300-year-old fertility statistics still in use today Babies born to women aged 45 and over rise by a third Profile: Janet Jackson Janet Jackson: The stories behind the songs Janet Jackson is far from the only famous face to give birth later in life. Oscar-winning Halle Berry had her second child at 47, three years ago, and John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston gave birth to her third child at 48. Geena Davis - best known for her role in Thelma and Louise - became a mother later in life after falling in love with an Iranian-American neurosurgeon in her 40s. Her first child, a girl, arrived when she was 46, followed two years later by twin boys. Then there was Swiss billionaire Maria Louis-Dreyfus, who gave birth to twin girls in March 2016, aged 53. But these mothers - and Jackson - are all positively young when compared to the world's oldest new mothers. In fact, there are at least three women in India who claimed to have carried their children to term when at least two decades older than the pop singer. Omkari Panwar, said to be 70, gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, in 2008. A few months later, Rajo Devi Lohan - also 70 - gave birth to a little girl, her first, much-longed for child. Daljinder Kaur, who may be as old as 72, although she claimed to be just 70, gave birth to a son in April 2016 after three attempts at IVF. Each time, the births caused a debate over the ethical issues surrounding having a baby so late in life - especially after Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, the Spanish woman who once held the title of the world's oldest mother, died three years after having twin boys. All three are understood to have used donated eggs in order to have their children.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Norwich theatre group facing huge job losses,"Norwich Theatre told its 217 staff it had been ""forced"" to restructure following ""huge financial losses"". On Tuesday Norwich Theatre Royal cancelled its Christmas pantomime, blaming the prolonged coronavirus lockdown. Chief executive Stephen Crocker, said he was ""shocked and angry"" by the lack of government help for the arts. The group which runs Norwich Theatre Royal, the Playhouse and Stage Two said a formal process of consultation with all staff would now begin. 'No longer sustainable' Some 113 employees were told their roles were at risk of redundancy, with a further 59 workers on zero-hours contracts informed they would receive no further work. All large-scale shows previously planned to tour at Theatre Royal for the August-December 2020 period had been postponed, the company said. Michael Newey, chairman of the trustees of Norwich Theatre, said the coronavirus lockdown ""saw us immediately lose 95% of our income and this scale of ongoing financial loss is no longer sustainable"". 'Simply heartbroken' ""With no large-scale productions able to go ahead until next year, no clear date for when we will be able to operate at full scale again and no public funding intervention forthcoming, we have been forced to begin a major restructuring project to reduce our costs."" Chief executive Stephen Crocker, who described staff as ""the lifeblood of our organisation"", said: ""On their behalf I remain shocked and angry that the government is standing idle as an industry that has delivered so much to this country and is so vital to its recovery is being allowed to fade into dust. ""I am simply heartbroken."" The government said it was working with the industry to get it fully back up and running as soon as possible and it was considering the best way forward. But the actors' union Equity said that without investment to save jobs and venues the guidance would be meaningless. Norwich South MP Clive Lewis was among a handful of parliamentarians asking the government to offer more concrete support: ""Our venues are in jeopardy now because the government won't acknowledge their value and importance to our regional cities,"" he said in a joint letter to Caroline Dinenage MP, minister in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.

Google blocking 18m coronavirus scam emails every day,"By Joe TidyCyber-security reporter The tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion of phishing attacks in which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data. The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus. The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say. Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people. Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes. Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions. Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users. The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies. Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic. Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump. ""Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time,"" said independent security researcher Scott Helme. ""The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure."" 'Exploitation' Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources. One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone with ransomware and demands payment to restore the device. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint advisory. They said they had seen ""an increasing number of malicious cyber-actors"" that were ""exploiting the current Covid-19 pandemic for their own objectives"". The NCSC has published advice on its website to help people avoid becoming the victim of a scam.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Does Labour have an 'Ed Miliband problem'?,"By Chris MasonPolitical correspondent, BBC News His critics within the party articulate the concerns expressed by some voters in opinion polls and focus groups: that he doesn't appear sufficiently 'prime ministerial', and he hasn't set out a clear enough vision. In short, they wonder if he's up to it. But there are three reasons why most of those with concerns express them privately, rather than publicly. There is next to no appetite for a change of leader before the election, there is no obvious successor, and Labour could win. Most opinion polls suggest they will - although two this week have suggested a narrow lead for the Conservatives. At the weekend, the former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott said publicly what many mutter privately: time is running out and the Conservatives are boxing clever. In response, Ed Miliband uttered a line used before by a party leader facing a gust of internal turbulence: after more than four years as Leader of the Opposition, he was used to receiving advice, not all of it solicited. But he took on directly and passionately Lord Prescott's claim that his election pitch amounted to merely pursuing core Labour voters and disaffected Liberal Democrat supporters: what political types call a ""core vote strategy"". ""If anyone believes that the NHS is a minority issue in British politics, they are dead wrong. The NHS is a massive issue for people right across our country,"" Mr Miliband said. It is a message we are likely to hear again and again, in an election campaign that appears unprecedented. ""I've never known an election like it,"" one veteran MP, who has been in the Commons since the 1970s, told me. With every passing week a close race looks like it is getting closer - with a growing number of variables making it harder and harder to guess what might happen. 'Jitters' What will the rise of UKIP do to the Conservative vote? And to Labour and the Liberal Democrats? Will the spike in popularity for the SNP in Scotland be sustained until the election - and will that rob Labour of seats crucial for Ed Miliband? Will the Lib Dems face annihilation? And if so, where? Can the Conservatives win more seats than they have now - something not done by a governing party since the 1950s? Can Labour win when their leader and their economic policies are apparently liked less than those of the Conservatives? Your guess is as good as mine. Little wonder there are a few jitters around. Plenty in all the parties will have a few between now and May.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: St Albans' The Horn venue 'gobsmacked' at support,"The Horn in St Albans, which normally hosts about 80 acts per month, said it faced a ""potentially very grave future"". Supported by acts including Paul Young and Enter Shikari, the appeal quickly shot up to £17,000. Owner Adrian Bell said it had been a ""massive boost"" for staff. ""We are absolutely gobsmacked by the level of support. We can't thank people enough,"" he said. The venue, in Victoria Street, opened as The Horn of Plenty in the early 1970s, and, run by managers including footballer and actor Vinnie Jones' mother, quickly became known for its live music. BBC Radio 1's John Peel was a frequent customer and artists who kicked off careers there included Kim Wilde, who also worked behind the bar, Paul Young and the Q-Tips and more recently The Gallows, The Subways, Enter Shikari and Friendly Fires. Young, who first played there in 1976 with Streetband, said it ""always had a reputation for being a wild place"" but it had ""just a naturally great hall for putting a band on"". ""People wanted small venues, that was how bands got started,"" he said. Owner Adrian Bell said lockdown restrictions meant it faced ""an unpredictable and potentially very grave future"". He has set up a £30,000 crowdfunding appeal but said if they could not successfully reopen, everyone would be refunded. The venue is an estimated £54,000 in debt which includes a £32,000 VAT bill, backdated rent and utility bills. Mr Bell, who has been there for 20 years, said it did not qualify for a government grant. He has applied for various government loans under the pandemic but they are ""not a free handout"" and must be repaid, he said. ""We rely on 200 people jumping up and down and enjoying music so we couldn't just reopen, even when we are allowed to, because of social distancing,"" he said. ""I don't envisage us going back to being a venue until sometime next year or a until a vaccine comes out."" The crowdfunder has been supported by those in the music industry, including David Bowie's guitarist, Reeves Gabrels, BBC Radio 6's Steve Lemacq, Billy Lunn from The Subways, and Paul Young. Enter Shikari front man Rou Reynolds said it would be ""incredibly sad"" to lose the venue. ""It would be taking consistent live music out of the city and a massive part of the history [would be] uprooted,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ring of Peace: Iconic Belfast mural 'speaks' with 'advertising' addition,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Arts Correspondent Ring of Peace was originally painted in 1998 to mark the Good Friday Agreement. It is the work of the American-Chilean artist Francisco Letelier, and local artists from Queen Street Studios in the city. Now the Waring Street mural has an unexpected new addition as its central characters have decided to speak. Speech bubbles have been added, apparently advertising the services of a nearby firm. Artist Jennifer Trouton worked on the mural, and she is unhappy that it has been altered. ""I was up and down the 60 foot scaffolding for several weeks in 1998, helping Francisco paint it,"" she said. Prank ""It was very significant for me as I was a recent graduate and had studied in Belfast during the Troubles, so it was a very positive experience for me to paint something on this scale with this kind of message. She said she was ""horrified and shocked"" when she noticed its new look. ""I initially thought it was a prank - it's certainly no Banksy. ""They're not saying anything satirical or witty and they're not making us look at the world in any way differently."" Prof Bill Rolston from the University of Ulster is an expert in murals. He said the piece is significant. ""The Californian influence is quite evident in the style; it's quite hippy-looking. Unwritten ""It's an aspirational mural, painted at a particular point in time in the enthusiasm of the Good Friday Agreement. ""There was the notion that here was a new dawn, so it fits that sort of optimism. ""Probably if you painted it now it would be a bit darker, or a bit more confused!"" He said that adding the speech bubbles was ""ridiculous"". ""There is an unwritten rule here that you don't destroy someone else's mural unless it's really dilapidated, and there's always some negotiation or a nod towards the people who did the original mural. ""That's not been done here."" Whoever has altered the mural is not breaking any laws, and would not have had to apply for planning permission to insert the speech bubbles into the mural.

Delay for Nasa's Tess planet-hunter,"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent, Cape Canaveral The telescope was due to go up from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 18:32 local time on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. But the flight was stood down some three hours before lift-off. SpaceX said it wanted some additional time to understand an issue related to the guidance, navigation and control of its vehicle. The company added that its teams were now working towards an 18 April launch at 18:51 EDT (2351 BST). The BBC understands that scientists on the mission also want a delay so they can run some extra checks on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite itself. When Tess does get up, it will stare at stars for weeks at a time, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting worlds traverse their faces. The expectation is that it could identify some 2,000-3,000 planets in its first two years of operation. The satellite, which carries four camera-detectors, will essentially compile a catalogue that other telescopes - both on the ground and in space - can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Sara Seager from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which leads the Tess project. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" Perhaps the key actor in this future study will be the successor to Hubble - the James Webb space observatory, due in orbit from 2020. It promises an ability to resolve the atmospheres of some of the new worlds, to look for gases that might hint at the presence of life. James Webb will ""tease out the chemical compositions of those atmospheres and look for whatever's there,"" said Paul Hertz, the astrophysics director at Nasa. ""People are very interested in looking for, what on Earth, are bio-signatures, such as methane, carbon dioxide, water vapour and oxygen."" Bill Chaplin is an astroseismologist from Birmingham University, UK. He is interested in the variations in brightness of the stars that will be observed by Tess. This variability is a consequence of resonances in the stars' outer layers, and it allows the British professor to pull out a lot of extra information. ""We can measure the stars' fundamental properties. We can say how massive they are and how old they are. In addition, we can form a picture of what the inside of a star looks like. So, in essence we can do the equivalent of an ultrasound scan on them."" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Shark kills number 100 million annually, research says","By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, BBC News The researchers say that this rate of exploitation is far too high, especially for a species which reproduces later in life. The major factor driving the trade is the ongoing demand for shark fins for soup in Chinese communities. The report has been published in the Journal Marine Policy. Researchers admit that establishing the true level of global shark fishing is extremely difficult, as the quality of the data is poor. Many sharks that are caught have their fins removed at sea with the body dumped overboard. These fish are often not included in official reports. Fin margin However, the scientists estimate a mortality range of between 63 and 273 million sharks in 2010. ""There is a very large range and that speaks to the quality of data, which is not great,"" said Dr Demian Chapman from Stony Brook University in New York, US. ""Certainly 100 million is the median estimate and that's the best estimate there is,"" he added. While the number of sharks being caught has not changed substantially between 2000 and 2010, the authors of the research argue that the commercial fishing fleets are simply changing location and the shark species they target in order to keep up with demand. The fear is that eventually these shark species will crash. Fuelling the concern is the fact that many of the species that are most threatened are very slow to reproduce. ""A lot of the sharks that are prized in the trade take more than a decade to reach maturity,"" said Dr Chapman. ""There is a really razor-thin level of mortality that sharks can experience before their population trajectory becomes negative - that is really what's been happening. ""They are not reproducing fast enough to keep up with the rate we are pulling them out of the ocean,"" he added. The biggest driver for shark fishing has been the demand for shark fin soup, a product that is seen as a luxury item among Chinese communities. While fins are still being cut off sharks at sea, several countries including Canada, the US and the European Union have tried to restrict this by law. But this has not had the desired effect, Dr Chapman explained. ""The problem is that the fins are so valuable that now people are not 'finning' the sharks at sea - they're keeping the whole thing. But it is still dead; the finning bans have not stopped the root problem."" On Sunday, negotiators from 178 countries will gather in Bangkok for the meeting of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). There are proposals to regulate the trade in five of the most threatened species of shark. At a previous meeting in 2010, similar restrictions fell just short of the required-two thirds majority. This time, campaigners say they have broad support among developed and developing countries and are optimistic they will be able to muster the required votes.

"'Suckers list': Scammers target over 1,000 people in NI","By Kevin MageeBBC News NI Those named on the list are singled out for special attention from scammers, and are frequently bombarded by scam mail, e-mails and phone calls. Often the victims were put on the list after they replied to previous attempts by scammers to take their money. The first they know of it is when they are contacted by Trading Standards. The ""suckers list"" is bought and sold among scammers operating from a host of countries. 'Personal advice' Trading Standards in Belfast has set up a special project to warn those named on the list. ""I have obtained what is called a 'suckers list' for Northern Ireland. We did not name it as a suckers list, the scammers named it that,"" said Trading Standards officer Beverly Burns. ""My role is to visit each of these people on it and and give them one-to-one personal advice. These are people who have responded to scammers, who then go on a list that is traded around the world.

Driverless cars 'to increase congestion' says government,"The Department for Transport predicted a ""decline in network performance"" once one in four cars become driverless. However, should driverless vehicles make up between 50% and 75% of cars, DfT researchers say they will reduce congestion. The average time spent delayed on city roads at rush hour will fall by 12.4% when 25% of vehicles are driverless. The DfT said early models of the vehicles acted more cautiously and the result could be a ""potential decrease in effective capacity"" on motorways and A roads. But as more people adopted the technology and it became common place on the country's road network, the study found that congestion could be cut by 40%. Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: ""There's a prize to be had in terms of swifter, safer journeys, but the transition to that world will be challenging. ""There are around 32 million conventional cars on the UK's roads - as driverless cars come in, traffic flow could initially get worse rather than better, potentially for many years. ""Much will depend on how an autonomous car's parameters are set and just how defensively these vehicles will be programmed to drive."" The study used software to map out the effects of the cars on the road network. The DfT said the report was the first step into more trials and researching, ensuring driverless cares are ""safe and beneficial for all"". Transport minister John Hayes said: ""This exciting and extensive study shows that driverless cars could vastly improve the flow of traffic in our towns and cities, offering huge benefits to motorists including reduced delays and more reliable journey times."" Ministers are also planning to extend existing insurance cover to driverless vehicles, covering individuals when they are driving and when they have handed over control to the computer. In the event of a crash caused by the technology, a government consultation document suggests the driver and anyone else affected should be able to claim from the insurer and, in turn, the insurer would be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer. In the document, the government adds it will incorporate the insurance proposals for automated vehicles forward into the Modern Transport Bill, which is expected to be debated by MPs later this year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Hong Kong-Singapore travel corridor postponed,"The deal was due to kick in on Sunday, allowing passengers to fly both ways without the need to self-isolate. The decision is a blow to attempts by the two financial hubs to revive their battered travel sectors. Hong Kong reported 43 new infections on Saturday, the highest daily toll in nearly three months. The number includes 13 cases with unknown transmission sources, raising fears the local outbreak could get out of control. ""Today's decision is a responsible decision,"" Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau told reporters. ""For any scheme to be successful, it must fulfil the conditions of securing public health and also making sure that both sides [are] comfortable and feel safe about the scheme."" The decision will be revisited in early December, he added. Under the travel bubble arrangement, travellers would be required to take a Covid-19 test before departure and upon arrival. There would be no restrictions on the purpose of travel but passengers would have to take designated flights, and a maximum of 200 people would be allowed to travel each way per day. Neither Hong Kong nor Singapore has seen the large outbreaks of the virus experienced elsewhere. With small populations and heavy dependence on international air travel, they hope the travel corridor will help their key tourism and aviation sectors amid a global downturn. Shukor Yusof, an analyst with aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said the travel arrangements were fraught with challenges. ""There is no solution until the vaccine is available to all. The more airlines swim against the Covid tide, and try to beat the odds, the worse it will become. Best to endure, stay put, refine the business model and conserve cash,"" he told AFP news agency. Last month, an air travel corridor was introduced between Australia and New Zealand in which New Zealanders are exempt from self-isolation requirements when arriving in the state of New South Wales and the Northern Territory. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 290 airlines, expects traffic this year to be 66% below the level it was in 2019. The IATA estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the pandemic led to a 72% drop in international tourists in the first half of the year. However, there has been a rebound in domestic tourism in some markets, such as China.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Average speed cameras 'possible for Avon and Somerset',"Fixed speed cameras across the region are being axed after councils reduced their contributions to their road safety budgets and speed enforcement. It could potentially leave some areas without any speed cameras. But e-mails obtained by the BBC show discussions have taken place about average speed check cameras replacing fixed cameras. Avon and Somerset Police are due to take over running the mobile speed cameras from April after the majority of council funding was axed. Many fixed cameras across Bristol, Bath and Somerset could be turned off because of the funding cut. The suggestion of using the cameras was made at a meeting in late-February and came to light following a Freedom of Information Act request by the BBC. Derek Baillie, who was helping to finish work recommended in a report by Deloittes, told Terry Bullock, traffic manager at Bristol City Council, about the discussion with Safety Camera Partnership chairman Laurie Lewis. Speed enforcement In the e-mail Mr Baille said: ""He [Mr Lewis] wants to put ANPR [automatic number plate recognition] cameras up - in pairs - on lighting columns and link them to a system for average speed measurement. ""So, in return for allowing the police to use your lighting columns you might get some speed enforcement."" Mr Baille added he asked Mr Lewis to submit a written proposal for the scheme. Mr Bullock, from Bristol City Council, replied: ""I am happy with the principle of using lamp columns for this purpose."" He added that many of the city's cameras were already ANPR-capable but some of the city centre ones would not be suitable for speed enforcement. ""However we do have a series of cameras on some of our quality bus corridors [the 'showcase' bus routes] which may be more suitable,"" he added. A spokeswoman for Avon and Somerset Police said it did not wish to comment about the possible use of average speed check cameras. It also added Mr Lewis did not want to discuss the matter. South Gloucestershire Council said the use of the cameras were a police initiative and there had been no formal approach. A Bristol City Council spokesman said it was aware of the plan to use ANPR cameras to regulate speed in the city. ""There has been no formal approach by the police and one would need to come from them,"" he added. ""The likelihood may be that only arterial roads, such as the Portway, would be feasible.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stonehenge's tallest stone 'points at winter sunrise',"Historians have long known the circle of stones is aligned with the midsummer sunrise but Tim Daw says the tallest one is lined up with the midwinter sun. It was previously thought the stone had been put back at the wrong angle when it was re-erected in 1901. But Mr Daw, who works there, says his research shows its angle is deliberate. 'Botched job' Mr Daw said: ""The largest stone at Stonehenge is not where it 'should' be, it is twisted. ""This stone, Stone 56, is the tallest one at the end of the inner horseshoe of sarsen stones. ""Because it was put back to the vertical in 1901 it has been assumed that the twist is the result of the modern excavators botching the job. ""My research shows that not only was the standing stone out of symmetry with the central solstice alignment originally, but that its now fallen partner had also been, and so were surrounding stones, including the Altar Stone."" Mr Daw, who last year came up with evidence that the outer stone circle at Stonehenge was once complete, said his newly discovered alignment was at 80 degrees to the line of the axis of the monument, which points to midsummer solstice sunrise and midwinter sunset. '100 tonnes of stone' ""The stones point to the midwinter solstice sunrise and midsummer sunset,"" he said. ""This alignment had been missed by previous investigators... as they used an idealised plan rather than an actual plan for their calculations."" ""This isn't some nebulous sighting line on a distant star; this is 100 tonnes of stone deliberately pointing to the major event at the other end of the day the rest of the monument celebrates. ""One stone out of line might be a coincidence but that it is five of the major stones, at least, shows it was a designed feature. ""It shows what can be discovered by simple observation even in such a well-researched site as Stonehenge."" Director of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society (WANHS), David Dawson, said: ""This is an interesting new idea which highlights the ""skew"" of the Stonehenge trilithons, which has been known for some time. ""It highlights the significance of the summer and winter solstices at Stonehenge, and the 80 degree angle between them. ""We know that the Bush Barrow lozenge, on display at the Wiltshire Museum, hints at this same significant astronomical feature.

Mr Morgan told the BBC's North West Tonight that leaders in Merseyside would back the plans if businesses forced to close during this period received a financial aid package.

But no previous generation of children has had so public a childhood and not all of them are happy about it when they're older. So, to sharent or not to sharent? You've been answering the question - and it's caused a bit of a stir. The range of views we saw on Facebook fell broadly into three categories. The proud parents These guys love their children dearly and would dearly love their Facebook friends to know about it. Savannah Morrison, from Glasgow, loves to share pictures of her son with family and friends. ""I love posting photos of my wee one on Facebook/Instagram. I love my friends and family commenting or liking them,"" she wrote on the BBC News Facebook page. ""I love commenting and liking photos of my friends' and family's kids too, and I think it's amazing that I can still feel part of their lives although we are miles apart. ""In my opinion, as long as the photos are not indecent and you can justify their presence to your child (if asked when they are all grown up), then crack on."" The privacy protectors No less proud of their children, some parents are more cautious about sharing their pictures online. Rosie McDonald, from Bangor, believes that her son's right to privacy is paramount. ""I make a big point of not putting my son's picture on Facebook,"" she said. ""He is a human being and has the same right to privacy as anyone else. ""However, at such a young age his capacity to understand privacy on that level isn't the same as an adult. ""It is my job as his parent to make sure he is afforded his rights and respected."" The irked at over-sharing Some people have got over-sharing fatigue. Their Facebook timelines are filled with other people's children, and they've had enough of it. Shaun Bacon doesn't want to see it. ""I hate it when [parents] post things such as birthday messages when [their kids] aren't old enough for Facebook, so won't even see it,"" he wrote. ""Don't tell me it's their birthday or how proud of them you are, just tell them yourselves as they're in the same house as you."" ""I don't need to see it.""

Firefighters rescue 'record' number of people,"Firefighters rescued 32 people per week between April 2017 and March 2018 - up 12% on the previous year. More than 1,500 people were rescued from non-fire incidents, while 176 were rescued from fires, the union said. Non-fire incidents include road traffic accidents, flooding, hazardous chemical spillages and lift rescues. The fire service rescued 1,695 people in total in Northern Ireland in 2017/18. That is a significant increase on the 2016/17 when 1,498 were rescued, 142 from fires. That was down 3% from the previous year when 1,547 people were rescued, 138 from fires. 'Life-saving work' The union said it compiled the figures via Freedom of Information requests, after the Westminster government stopped publishing the statistics in 1999. Jim Quinn, from the union, said the role of firefighters had ""vastly expanded"". ""Firefighters are rescuing more people year-on-year, with non-fire incidents nearly outnumbering fire rescues tenfold,"" he said. ""These figures show that need for firefighters in all their roles is increasing and reveal the immense value of their life-saving work."" He explained that about one third of the 1,500 non-fire rescues were road crashes. ""Everyone does see the fire service turning out to car accidents and extracting people and helping rescue people, but there's a wide and varied range of calls which we attend,"" Mr Quinn told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. 'Cats up trees' ""We have lots of issues on farms with slurry tanks and even farmers trying to rescue animals themselves and finding themselves getting into difficulty. ""We also have people trapped in machinery; people finding themselves trapped on roofs, up trees and the typical one is cats up trees."" He argued that such calls were important ""because some people will try and rescue an animal themselves and put themselves in danger"" whereas firefighters are equipped to respond safely to animal rescues. Mr Quinn added that the overall number of calls received by the fire service has reduced, but he said some of that was ""down to the good work of the fire service"" in educating people about smoke alarms and chip pan fires. Last year, the fire service warned that service response times could be affected by Brexit. It said currency swings could affect its budget, and that fleet management - which depends on the import of vehicles from the EU - may also be at risk.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How Liam Payne and Alesso made their new video in lockdown,"By Sinead GarvanNewsbeat entertainment reporter Unfortunately they didn't make a music video before lockdown - but they decided not to let social distancing get in the way of that. Liam got on the phone to Conor Butler, a video producer who's made behind-the-scenes videos for him in the past. ""It would have been easier for us to make a lyric video,"" 25-year-old Conor tells Radio 1 Newsbeat from his home in Bradford. ""But being a creative type, I thought it'd be really good if we could come together and get some sort of content for this."" This is what they came up with. Conor spoke to Alesso's team in Los Angeles and Liam in London. Making music videos usually involves long days and big budgets - but this one was a much simpler process. There was one person holding the camera in Alesso's studio and another at Liam's house - both the people they are in lockdown with. Conor was giving directions to the two musicians on the end of the phone. ""You have to lose an aspect of control at that point and put the responsibility in other people's hands a little bit,"" he explains. ""I was quite excited just to see what was going to come back when the shots had been done, because you are not physically there to see how each one looks."" When it came to what fans would see in the video, Conor only had their two houses to play with. He's good friends with Liam, so knew the layout of his house. ""I didn't know the layout of Alesso's home but with him being a producer I assumed he must have a studio,"" he explained. ""So I just kept sending messages and having phone calls with ideas for imagery, like having Alesso dancing to the song and playing with buttons in the studio. ""I wanted to see him producing a song so it felt as real as possible."" That was how both Alesso and Liam wanted it to feel too - authentic, but not too glossy. But even though there are no exotic locations in the video, pop-star houses tend to be quite nice and the video is still a polished production. ""It just needed to feel real, like they made the track and then they couldn't get out the house so the both came together to make a video the best they could,"" Conor says. It took about a week to turn the music video around and get it onto YouTube. ""I think the message was to try and stay focused and stay creative without all this bringing a halt to your creative workflow,"" he adds. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Abuser ordered to tell police about new relationships,"The order requires Kylle Godfrey, 30, of Neasden, north-west London, to tell police of any relationship lasting more than 14 days for the next seven years. He is serving a three-year sentence for attacking two ex-partners and intimidating a witness while on bail. The order is believed to be the first of its kind in England and Wales. As part of the order, police are able to inform any of Godfrey's future partners of his previous violence towards women, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme. Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs correspondent Since the introduction of ASBOs - anti-social behaviour orders - in 1998 the use of court orders to stop disruptive, harmful and violent behaviour has been common practice in England and Wales. But it's highly unusual for the terms of an order to contain a requirement that offenders tell police about people they're having a relationship with - not least because it may be hard to enforce. There is a precedent however: the case of John O'Neill, from York, who is subject to a Sexual Risk Order requiring him to tell police if he's starting a sexual relationship with a new partner. Godfrey was jailed on 14 February after admitting to two counts of actual bodily harm, perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation. A court heard how over several days in October last year, he attacked his ex-partner, banging her head on the floor and grabbing her around the throat. Following his arrest, Godfrey continued to intimidate the woman and, while on bail, assaulted another woman he had started a new relationship with. 'Protecting women' Domestic abuse charity Women's Aid described the order as a ""more robust safeguarding against domestic abuse"". Its chief executive, Polly Neate, said it ""demonstrates an understanding that a perpetrator of domestic abuse is likely to be abusive to many partners"". Jane Topping, of the Met Police's Hackney Community Safety Unit said: ""The order gives us a new way of protecting victims of domestic abuse and preventing other women from suffering at the hands of people like Godfrey. ""The victim in Godfrey's case was subjected to a horrendous ordeal by him following a sustained campaign of domestic violence,"" she added. Failure to comply with Criminal Behaviour Orders can carry jail sentences.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Neil Gorsuch pick: How did Trump keep choice secret?,"Just hours after Judge Neil Gorsuch received the US president's phone call to inform him he was his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, a government team was dispatched to Colorado to covertly shuttle him to Washington. The call from President Donald Trump came on Monday, 24 hours before the announcement was due to be broadcast live from the White House East Room. What followed next for the conservative judge was a secret meeting at a neighbour's home, a clandestine drive down a backcountry road in the Colorado Rockies, and a military flight to the US capital. ""So was that a surprise? Was it?"", the president asked the nation, as his nominee appeared by his side for the first time. There were reports on Tuesday that Mr Trump's final two choices were coming to Washington for the ceremony, which reminded everyone that the president used to host a reality TV show. Social media wags made comparisons to The Apprentice and The Bachelor. But the second choice, Thomas Hardiman, never made it to Washington, although he gave that impression when he was filmed getting petrol east from Pittsburgh on Tuesday morning. A spokesman for Mr Hardiman's court, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, told the BBC that he had instead travelled to Altoona, Pennsylvania, for ""a lengthy meeting"". If there was a deliberate ruse by the White House to heighten anticipation by pretending two people were still in the frame, a day after the selection process ended, then Mr Hardiman was happy to play his part and the whole operation went off perfectly. White House spokesman Sean Spicer explained to the journalists the lengths the government had gone to in order to keep Mr Trump's selection of Mr Gorsuch secret. After Mr Trump's call on Monday, a White House team flew to Denver then drove nearly an hour to Boulder to meet Mr Gorsuch and his family at a neighbour's house, in order to avoid the media's prying eyes. The White House team then spirited him through a ""back farm road"", Mr Spicer said, to a waiting military plane which brought him to Washington that night. He stayed that evening at a friend's house, in order to keep a low profile. More on this story There has been a sense of drama about other key selections made by Mr Trump. When he was selecting his vice-president, he reportedly asked his team after he had chosen Mike Pence if it was too late to change his mind. After US media reported that James Mattis would lead the Department of Defense, the Trump team denied the reports before Mr Trump revealed his decision on stage during his ""Thank You"" tour. Mr Gorsuch must be approved by the Senate before being sworn in as the ninth Supreme Court Justice.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Call for e-cigarette safety warnings,"Figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests show e-cigarettes or related equipment, including chargers, were involved in more than 100 fires in less than two years. The Local Government Association said more cases could be going unreported. An LGA spokesman said the numbers were a ""major cause for concern"". 'Graphic warnings' Data from 43 fire services across the UK shows they were called out to just eight incidents involving e-cigarettes in 2012. In 2013, that number increased to 43, figures obtained by the Press Association show. So far this year, fire services have been called to 62 such incidents. A number of incidents have been attributed to the use of incompatible chargers for the devices. In August, David Thomson, 62, was killed when an e-cigarette on charge exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using. Jeremy Hilton, chairman of the LGA's Fire Services Management Committee, said officials expected the number of incidents linked to e-cigarettes to continue rising as more smokers switched to them. ""Alarmingly, there is no way of knowing the true figure as we understand many cases are going unreported."" He added: ""We are urging e-cigarette manufacturers to introduce clear, prominent and graphic new warnings spelling out to users the dangers of using incompatible chargers with e-cigarette batteries."" The LGA represents all 46 fire authorities in England and Wales. Mr Hilton warned more deaths could follow if action was not taken. ""Tragically, at least one life has been claimed and more fatalities could follow unless this issue is addressed rigorously and robustly,"" he said. ""We are warning users that it is simply not worth risking their lives to save a few pounds by buying dodgy, dangerous or incompatible chargers."" Emma Apter, from the charity Electrical Safety First, said: ""We are becoming increasingly concerned about the number of incidents involving e-cigarettes. ""Recent events have shown that the simple act of charging one of these items can be deadly, so steps do need to be taken in order to make consumers more aware of the dangers."" She added: ""The advice is clear: do not use cheaper, unbranded chargers and do not leave e-cigarettes unattended whilst charging, especially overnight.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Forgotten cache of RNLI pictures 'preserved for posterity',"The photos were found earlier this year in a large dusty pile in the organisation's headquarters in Poole, Dorset. Work has been started to preserve the pictures, the earliest of which are from the 1920s, and digitise the whole collection. Joe Williams, of the RNLI, said: ""We are bringing the pictures back into the light."" Mr Williams, who is a project officer and archivist, said: ""It was an untapped resource and now we have preserved it for posterity."" It is hoped the conservation project will be finished early next year. Mr Williams said no-one was aware the collection had been left in unsuitable conditions. ""We had to bring it down from the attic to discover what was up there. ""It was a big mound of box files and photos being kept in very poor conditions near a lift mechanism,"" he said. It is a record of the charity's activities including royal visits, lifeboat-naming ceremonies and launches. Some of the standout pictures show the presentation of gallantry medals to crews. An RNLI team working alongside a number of Bournemouth University students has conserved and catalogued the pictures and many have been digitised. The team now intends to research some of the rescue stories behind the medal presentations. Some of the pictures will be used in care home reminiscence sessions and others are to be colourised, said Mr Williams. ""It has been a very enjoyable thing to do and very satisfying on a professional level,"" he added. Dave Riley, 40, the Helm of Poole lifeboat, said: ""When I look at old pictures, especially those men in old cork life jackets, I think if someone said 'Go to sea with that' I would have to think twice. ""Back then they were very brave. Yes, I go out in very rough seas but we have a better chance of coming home."" Mr Riley started as lifeboat crew when he was 17 and has also worked full time for the charity for the past 15 years. ""It's been said we are ordinary people doing extraordinary things but you don't think about it in black and white, you just do what you do."" The story of the RNLI saving lives at sea The charity's philosophy is to provide a lifesaving service using volunteers wherever possible. 1824 - Sir William Hillary's idea of a service dedicated to saving lives at sea begins 1838 - Grace Darling became a national heroine risking her life to save stranded survivors of the Forfarshire 1880 - The Zetland, built in 1802, was retired.

'No sprinklers in 96% of London high-rise council blocks',"By Thomas MackintoshBBC News, London The data seen by the BBC shows 32 out of 837 council-owned buildings above 30m (98ft) have sprinklers fitted. Croydon Central MP Sarah Jones said the government should set up a ""fire safety fund"" to help councils. Housing Minister Kit Malthouse said the government has taken steps to ensure the ""safety of high rise buildings"". After the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Southwark which killed six people, a coroner recommended councils across the country should consider retrofitting sprinklers in existing high-rise residential buildings. According to Ms Jones research, before the Grenfell fire on 16 June 2017 only nine towers that are ten storeys or higher had sprinklers fitted. Several councils across London, including Lambeth, Brent, Camden, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and City of London, say they have plans to install sprinklers following Grenfell. But Ms Jones said the government needed to ""put money aside"" to help local authorities. She said: ""In London we need retrofitted sprinklers fitted in over 800 tower blocks. We really do need that injection from government to support the work. ""Theresa May and the Government said they would do 'whatever it takes to keep people safe'."" After Grenfell, 23 tower blocks have had sprinklers installed with the majority in high rise buildings owned by Croydon Council. Angela Bracher, a resident in one of the tower blocks, said the sprinklers in her flat made her feel ""very, very secure"". She added: ""I was upset about the Grenfell fire, it was so shocking, and it made me feel that I wouldn't live as far as the ninth or tenth floor. ""When we received notice about the sprinklers I jumped. I feel so much more safe."" In Wales, since 2016 it has been mandatory for all residential buildings to be fitted with sprinklers; a move which has been backed by a London Assembly report. On 22 March, the then Secretary for Housing, Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid told parliament the government would work with councils on ""financial flexibilities"" over demands for installing sprinklers. In response to Ms Jones' research Mr Malthouse said the government has taken steps to ensure the ""immediate safety of all high rise buildings"" following the Grenfell fire. He added: ""We are going to fully fund the removal and replacement of unsafe cladding, like the type used on Grenfell Tower, estimated at £400m. ""Sprinklers can be effective, but they are one of many fire safety measures that can be adopted. ""If local authorities have concerns about the costs of essential fire safety measures, they should contact us to discuss their position and any flexibilities we can offer.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Paris poised for maximum Covid alert,"Olivier Véran said infection rates in the capital and its suburbs are rising and a decision on imposing new restrictions will be made on Sunday. He added that a ""total closure of bars"" could be needed in the capital. France, one of many European countries that are seeing a rise in cases, recorded more than 13,000 infections on Thursday. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that surging figures in Europe should serve as ""a wake up call"". In a news conference on Thursday, Mr Véran said the Paris region passed three thresholds qualifying for a maximum alert on Thursday. One of these was the number of infections, which has now surpassed 250 per 100,000 people. ""We need a few days to confirm the trends, but if they are confirmed, we'll have no choice but to put it on maximum alert, from Monday,"" he said. According to Mr Véran, more than 30% of beds in Paris's intensive care units have been filled with Covid-19 patients. He warned that if the maximum alert was put in place, there would be no more family reunions and bars would be closed. Bars and restaurants in the region already have to close by 22:00. Similar restrictions have already been introduced in Marseille. Last Monday, Mr Véran announced bars, restaurants and gyms would close in the southern city for at least two weeks amid an upsurge in cases. On Thursday, France recorded 13,970 cases and 63 deaths. More than 31,986 people have died in the country since the pandemic began, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Elsewhere in Europe, the Spanish government has ordered a partial lockdown in the capital Madrid. Under the restrictions, residents will not be allowed to leave the area unless they have to make an essential journey. The UK has taken Poland and Turkey off its no quarantine list. Those arriving from the two countries from 04:00 BST (03:00 GMT) on Sunday will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Poland's infection rate has risen, while the UK government said it removed Turkey over concerns about the way the country reports its data.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Outrage as Emirates tells cabin crew to remove Taiwan flag pins,"By Simon AtkinsonAsia Business Reporter A leaked email says the airline was ""instructed by the Chinese government"" to ""follow the One China policy"". Crew were told to wear China's flag instead, but this directive was later withdrawn. Flag pins show passengers the nationality and languages of crew. The airline told the BBC there had been a ""communication error"". A spokesperson said that now no crew needed to wear any flag pin, whatever their nationality. But the airline did not explain why, if this was an airline-wide change in uniform policy, such a specific demand had been made to Taiwanese crew. The BBC also asked whether Chinese authorities had indeed complained about staff wearing the Taiwan flag - but the airline is yet to respond. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and insists that the self-ruled island is an inalienable part of one China to be reunified one day. 'Incorrect and inappropriate' The email, quoted by the South China Morning post and other media in Asia, said cabin crew were ""to follow the One China policy"" - a hugely sensitive diplomatic tightrope. ""This means you must remove the Taiwanese flag from your service waistcoat and replace it with the Chinese flag,"" wrote Nicola Parker, the airline's uniform standards and development manager. She added fresh stocks of China badges were being ordered. However, hours later, Ms Parker wrote a second email saying that the previous message was ""incorrect and inappropriate"", apologising for ""any upset I may have caused"". She added: ""Please refrain from wearing your Taiwanese flags on flights until further notice. Therefore no flag is required on your uniform."" But in a statement to the BBC, the airline apologised for what it said was a communication error. ""An internal email was sent to cabin crew instructing them to remove a flag pin from their uniform and replace it with another flag pin. This email was sent in error and has since been retracted. ""Our intent is to recall the flag pins worn by all our cabin crew as part of our uniform update. This is based on ongoing feedback and review from our teams. All cabin crew are no longer required to wear a flag pin as part of their uniform. "" Flying high On social media, users have responded by repeatedly posting pictures of the Taiwanese flag on the airline's Facebook account, with some also vowing to boycott the airline. China is a major growth area for several airlines, with industry body Iata predicting the country will replace the US as the world's largest aviation market in terms of number of flights by 2029. Emirates already flies dozens of flights a week between Dubai and the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Yinchuan and Zhengzhou. And the airline says it carried more than 1.3 million passengers and 106,000 tons of cargo on its China services in 2015.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boris Johnson and wife Marina Wheeler to get divorced,"In a joint statement, they said they are now in the process of divorcing, after the Sun newspaper broke the news of their split. The couple have been married for 25 years and said the decision was taken some months ago. Mr Johnson, long touted as a future Tory leader, quit the cabinet in July attacking Theresa May's Brexit plan. In a joint statement, he and Ms Wheeler said: ""Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate. ""We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way. ""As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead. ""We will not be commenting further."" Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler, a barrister, married in 1993 and have four children together, Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, a fellow student at Oxford. News of the split follows newspaper allegations about Mr Johnson having had another extra-marital affair. In 2004, the MP was sacked from a shadow ministerial role by then Conservative leader Michael Howard for allegedly lying over an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt - something he had denied as an ""inverted pyramid of piffle"". He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU. In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run. But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions. Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said: ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations. ""I'm frankly fed up with talking about Boris Johnson"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Cat ownership rise driven by men, survey suggests","The Pet Food Manufacturers' Association said the number of pet cats in the country has gone up by 500,000 to reach eight million in the past year. The rise was driven by one million more men getting a feline friend, the PFMA, which spoke to 8,000 households, says. Celebrity cat owners, such as Russell Brand and Ed Sheeran, may have also influenced the new pet owners, it says. About 17% of men in the UK (5.5m) now own a cat, up from 13% (4.2m) in 2016, according to the survey. Hugh Wigmore lives in London with his cat Nigel Harmsworth. ""I like having a cat because we have loads in common,"" said Hugh. ""We both love cuddles, jelly and the outdoors! ""We get on really well. I'd definitely recommend it to other guys. Nigel is fantastic."" Sam Sahota went the extra mile, adopting three newborn kittens which had been dumped in a dustbin, despite a vet saying they had no chance of survival. ""I had always been a dog man, but when my colleague found a box with three kittens inside, my natural instinct was to save them from certain death,"" he said. ""I fed them milk from syringes, I placed a clock under their blanket to replicate the heartbeat of their mother and spent hours a day raising them."" Now Sam adores owning cats. ""The thing I love most is how playful they are,"" he added. ""Their curiosity, the affection they show which is real, unlike a dog. ""Cats do not need the attention a dog does but when it gives you attention is not false. They select who they want to be with."" James Copeman, from Canterbury, said having cats made his house ""feel full"" and loves coming home to his two, Miles and Keiko, waiting at the door. ""We never had pets when I was young so it's something I've always wanted,"" he said. ""They always seem to know when you need a bit of attention after a bad day. ""I'd definitely recommend it but you have to be prepared for the wake up calls, smelly litter trays and scratched furniture!"" Mike Brooks, from Nottingham, has three cats and loves them as pets. ""I got a cat because I have always had cats since I was a child and they're wonderful creatures,"" he said. ""They're cute, usually cuddly (if you respect their wishes), generally low-maintenance, and there is nothing more satisfying than the purr of a happy cat."" Michael Bellingham, chief executive of PFMA, said: ""Pet ownership is a rewarding experience for everyone. It's wonderful to see that men are realising the huge benefits of pets with an increase in cat ownership in this sector."" The most popular pet in the UK is fish - 33 million are kept in tanks and ponds around the country - followed by dogs at 8.5 million. There are also 900,000 rabbits, 700,000 pet birds, 700,000 reptiles, 600,000 domestic fowl, 500,000 guinea pigs and 300,000 hamsters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pro-and anti-Spearmint Rhino protesters in Sheffield stand-off,"Spearmint Rhino supporters say it is ""not feminist"" to close strip clubs, but objectors say the club is demeaning to women and sited in the wrong place. The national chain's Sheffield club has been on Brown Street for over 15 years. Spearmint Rhino has declined to comment ahead of the licence renewal decision, due later this week. Yorkshire breaking news: 100 jobs axed at Poundworld HQ in Yorkshire; Rats allowed to run wild at York museum Roz Wollen, of campaign group Zero Option Sheffield, said some cities ""have taken the brave step, the right one, actually saying no to strip clubs"".

Sheffield Hallam University, leading objections, said a lap dancing club so close to a ""world class university"" was ""ludicrous"". 'Not feminist' But Charlie Murphy, of Sheffield Students' Union Labour group, said: ""Feminism is not about telling other women what to do with their bodies and what jobs to do. ""Women should have full autonomy. Shutting down a strip club claiming it is feminism whilst simultaneously putting women out of work is not feminist. ""All labour is exploitative. Claiming that women are being exploited by Spearmint Rhino is no different to saying you are being exploited when you work in a supermarket."" Single mother Rachel McCoy, 36, who performs at the club, described women in the industry as ""strong and supportive"". She said financially the job had ""transformed my family's world."" John Specht, Spearmint Rhino UK's vice-president, said the Sheffield club employs 13 staff and has 40 ""entertainers"", some of whom have worked there for ""over a decade"", the Local Democracy Reporter Service said.

Appeal after storm grounds seabirds in Pembrokeshire,"The charity rescued almost 500 of the seabirds from the cliffs and surf at Newgale in Pembrokeshire on Tuesday. Around 100 were put down either because of injuries or because it was deemed they would not survive. The rest have been taken to an animal rescue centre in Somerset with the aim of releasing them back into the wild. The RSPCA is returning to the area on Wednesday to see if any more are stranded. It said on Wednesday some birds were being collected from as far inland as Llandeilo and Llandovery in Carmarthenshire. It said it was the biggest bird rescue in the area since the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. There are an estimated 170,000 breeding pairs of the birds on Skomer and Skokholm islands off Pembrokeshire. Skomer warden for the Wildlife Trust, Chris Taylor, said: ""They are hardy little birds, really well designed for long distance flying."" But he told BBC Radio Wales the storm hit just as they were heading off on their annual migration to South America and many of those rescued would not have been very old. ""The young ones are probably the majority of birds that ended up on Newgale beach. ""Sadly this big storm, the biggest winds we've had on the island since March time, has hit them. It's really bad timing really. ""What I suspect is a big raft of birds, maybe resting at night, has been on the sea and then they've been caught up in the storm. 'Do our best' ""These sea birds need to be out at sea with the fish . . . they've got a massive journey to make before more storms come in so hopefully the RSPCA will release them as soon as possible."" The RSPCA is advising anyone who comes across a stranded Manx shearwater to let it know. Inspector Keith Hogben said: ""It is vital that we do our best to locate these birds as soon as possible as they are otherwise at risk with regards to predators, the weather, shock and hypothermia. ""We are alerting people that the juveniles may even be found further afield in Carmarthenshire and Fishguard in northern Pembrokeshire."" He said the birds had long straight slim wings and were black and white. Their feet are far back on the body enabling efficient swimming but it makes life on land difficult. They cannot walk easily and tend to be ungainly, shuffling and sometimes sledging along on their belly. ""If you live in the area and do come across them the best way to capture them without encountering their sharp beak is to throw something like a towel over them and then carefully put them in a box,"" he added. The RSPCA's 24-hour helpline number is 0300 1234999.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
South Korea warns Japan over comfort women review,"She called on Japan to embrace ""truth and reconciliation"". Japan apologised in 1993 to survivors of the many thousands of women who were forced into army brothels. On Friday Tokyo said it would set up a panel to review the evidence on which that apology was based. Some conservatives in Japan have claimed that the women, known euphemistically as ""comfort women"", were prostitutes - something fiercely denied by the women and by Japan's neighbours. President Park's warning came in a speech marking the anniversary of a 1919 uprising in Korea against Japanese colonial rule. ""Historical truth is in testimony from the survivors,"" she said. ""Japan would only bring isolation on itself if it turns a deaf ear to their testimony and sweeps it under the rug for political benefits."" President Park urged Japan to follow the example of Germany in repenting its past wrongs so that their two countries could ""move forward for a new era of co-operation, peace and prosperity"". ""I hope Japan extricates itself from denial of history and starts making a new history of truth and reconciliation"", she said. Some 200,000 women in territories occupied by Japan during World War Two are estimated to have been forced to become sex slaves for troops. Many of the women came from China and Korea, but also from the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. The 1993 acknowledgement from Japan was viewed as a landmark apology. Issued by then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono, the statement acknowledged that women had been coerced, and that the Japanese military had been involved in the establishment and management of the process. His statement was based in part on evidence given by 16 Korean women. However, Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said on Friday that a team would be formed to review the lead-up to the 1993 statement. He said the team would ""re-examine and understand the background"". He did not say whether Japan would issue a new statement following the review. Former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has urged against any revision of the apology. Mr Murayama, who was prime minister from June 1994 to January 1996, said that the Kono statement was based on evidence.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grape choke inquest: PC 'desperate' for help with girl,"Jasmine Lapsley was on holiday in Morfa Nefyn, Gwynedd, when she collapsed after eating a grape in August 2014. PC Aled Hughes was visiting friends next door and helped give CPR with his wife, a first aid trainer. The Caernarfon inquest heard Jasmine, from Liverpool, was flown to hospital in Bangor, where she later died. Giving evidence on the second day of the hearing, PC Hughes described how he found the young girl ""motionless"". ""Her lips were blue. She was not breathing. She was limp,"" he said. He said there was ""no sign of life"". Working with his wife Awen, they gave ""dozens"" of CPR cycles to Jasmine, he told the coroner's court. He said he was there performing CPR for 10 to 15 minutes, and ""it felt like a long time"". He added: ""I was very concerned."" His wife told the inquest she was concentrating so hard on trying to save Jasmine, it did not seem like a long time before community first responders arrived. ""I have never seen a child who wasn't breathing before. It was an awful situation,"" said Mrs Hughes. 'Crowd of people' But giving evidence, community first responder Rosalind Hemming described the scene as ""very confusing"". Community first responders are volunteers trained in life-saving first aid techniques and are dispatched by the Welsh Ambulance Service at the same time as an ambulance crew. ""When we arrived on the scene the patient, Jasmine, seemed to be lying in a whole crowd of people,"" said Mrs Hemming, who has been a responder for 10 years, and had herself received training from Awen Hughes. ""Awen was ongoing with chest compressions and her husband... mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. ""I asked 'shall we take over?' and she said no."" She later told the coroner that she should have been ""more forceful"" in taking control of the situation, but at the time she ""didn't know my position within the ambulance service"". She also denied an allegation made by Jasmine's family on Monday, that the first responders ""shrugged their shoulders"" when asked if they had suction equipment. ""We would never do that,"" said Mrs Hemming. The inquest continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cancer patient 'given drug overdose after hospital pharmacy error',"Barbara Curtis, 81, was being treated for acute myeloid leukaemia when the mistake was made by a pharmacy at Royal Bournemouth Hospital in December 2017. She died less than three weeks later on 17 January 2018. Both the cancer and the drug contributed to her death from sepsis, Bournemouth Coroner's Court was told. The court heard Mrs Curtis was being given palliative care to help her to continue living at home, and was put on a course of cytarabine. However, a mistake in the hospital pharmacy meant she was taking doses of 100mg of the drug, twice a day, rather than the prescribed 20mg. Pharmacy technician Katherine Kendall told the hearing she had amended the dose on the paperwork in error as she ""hadn't been paying the proper attention"". ""At the time I thought I was doing the right thing,"" she said. She added that it was a ""busy work environment"" and it was ""possible that contributed to what I did"". 'Horrified' The court heard Ms Kendall's amendment was checked by two other members of the pharmacy team who did not spot the error. Dr Renata Walewska, a haematology consultant who was treating Mrs Curtis, said she was ""horrified"" when the mistake was brought to her attention and alerted the patient and her family. She said the treatment, which Mrs Curtis had been receiving for four and a half days, was immediately stopped on 3 January 2018. She said Mrs Curtis had not displayed any side-effects at that stage but was suffering with an infection, which later deteriorated and she died in hospital. Pathologist Dr Stephen Holwill said her cause of death was neutropenic sepsis due to acute myeloid leukaemia treated with cytarabine. He said the leukaemia was ""on the balance of probabilities the greater cause of death"" but the cytarabine would have made a ""more than trivial contribution"". Expert witness Dr Lisa Lowry, a consultant haematologist, said Mrs Curtis was prescribed a small dose of the drug and 100mg was given to other patients receiving more intensive treatment. ""This turn of events would not have been unexpected with the correct dose,"" she added. The inquest continues. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Tupac-loving US public servant fired as emails emerge,"Jerry Foxhoven was ousted as Iowa's Director of Human Services in June after at least one member of staff complained to lawmakers. The Tupac super-fan also held ""Tupac Fridays"" in his office where he played the deceased rapper's music. State officials have not confirmed if the dismissal was related to his workplace hip-hop references. ""I'm a 66-year-old white guy from the Midwest who likes rap music, who likes Tupac!"" Mr Foxhoven told public broadcaster NPR. In 350 emails seen by NPR and news agency AP, the civil servant shared quotes and marked milestones in the life of Tupac (also known as 2Pac). ""I might seem a little down because today is the 22nd anniversary of 2Pac's death,"" he wrote once to a staff member. Mr Foxhoven also assigned Tupac Shakur as mandatory reading for his class at Drake University, where he taught law. Speaking with NPR, he said he used his love of rap music to ""reach out to our staff, tell them that I'm human, have a little levity"". In his final message, sent to 4,300 employees, he said he hoped everyone would enjoy the upcoming Father's Day, which was also Tupac's birthday and his two-year anniversary as director. ""Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back,"" he wrote, citing Tupac. ""It simply means that you are 2 steps ahead."" He also praised staff, saying that is was ""an absolute honor to lead such a dedicated and committed group of people"". More than a dozen people reportedly wrote back to praise him for the message, but he was asked to resign soon afterwards without any explanation from Iowa's governor's office. Mr Foxhoven, however, told the New York Times that the decision was probably a ""coincidence"". Iowa's Department of Human Services is currently at the centre of several controversies, including the mistreatment of boys at a juvenile home and a spike in deaths at a centre for disabled people. A spokesperson for Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds told AP that ""a lot of factors"" contributed to Mr Foxhoven's resignation. The governor's office has refused to go into detail, despite an Iowa law requiring state agencies to release ""documented reasons and rationale"" when employees resign instead of being fired. Mr Foxhoven, who will soon be turning 67, told NPR that he had not yet decided what to do next. Except for one thing: ""I will be listening to some Tupac on my birthday. That's totally true.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Banksy donates funds from anti-arms artwork sale,"The artwork, Civilian Drone Strike, was on display at the Art the Arms Fair art exhibition in east London. It depicts drones destroying a cartoon image of a house, while a child and her dog look on in distress. The exhibition was held alongside the world's largest arms fair, the Defence and Security Equipment International - both exhibitions closed on Friday. The art exhibition claimed to highlight ""the inhumanity of the arms trade"" through art, with work by more than 1,600 exhibitors from 54 countries. 'Shut it down' The money raised from the Banksy sale will be split between one of the exhibition's organisers, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), and the human rights group Reprieve. Andrew Smith from CAAT said the money would be used ""to ensure we mobilise even more people against the next arms fair, so that we can stop it from happening"". He added: ""It's time to shut it down for good."" During last week's Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) fair, Mr Smith said it was ""shameful that the government is welcoming despots and dictatorships to the UK to buy weapons"". He added: ""If the government cares for human rights and democracy then it's time to end its support for arms fairs like DSEI."" The DSEI fair featured a vast array of state-of-the-art military equipment, from tanks and armoured personnel carriers through fighter jets and high-speed inflatables, to sniper rifles and hi-tech protective clothing. In his opening address, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox emphasised the importance of the defence industry to the UK economy, with an annual turnover of £35 billion last year. The Department for International Trade's stand featured a Bowler off-road rapid intervention vehicle (RIV) complete with machine gun, a light artillery gun and an inflatable rescue launch as well as a series of unmanned aerial drones. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK defence exhibition like DSEI. ""Respect for human rights is a mandatory consideration in the process and a country would not be invited where that would contradict the UK's international obligations."" Bristol-based artist Banksy is well-known for his politically provocative artworks - and has gained global notoriety for his unique, stencilled artwork on public walls and facades. Two years ago, he offered a free weapons guide at his Dismaland theme park in Weston-super-Mare to coincide with the 2015 DSEI arms fair. He asked members of the public to disperse the guide for tracking manufacturers of weapons used against public protest, saying it was ""of limited use in Weston-super-Mare"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Single market membership 'probably unlikely',"Clwyd West Conservative MP David Jones said the government wants to achieve access to the single market ""on the best possible terms"". He spoke after Prime Minister Theresa May told the Tory conference the UK was going to be a ""sovereign country"" with freedom over immigration decisions. The single market requires people can live and work freely across the EU. Restrictions on the free movement of people was something which the victorious Leave referendum campaign had promised to restrict. The single market is the mechanism under which EU states trade with each other without charging duty. It also sets common standards for goods and services across the member nations to reduce bureaucracy. Meanwhile Mrs May has told BBC Wales she wants to listen to the Welsh Government's views on Brexit to ensure it is ""fully engaged"" as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. She announced on Sunday the UK would trigger Article 50 - which formally launches the two-year process of leaving the EU - by the end of March. Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Wales programme at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mr Jones said: ""Access to the single market is something almost every country in the world has got. China has got access to the single market. America has. India has. ""The question is the basis upon which we have that access. ""I think that what is fairly clear from the prime minister's speech yesterday [Sunday] is that membership of the single market is probably unlikely, but access to it is something that we want to achieve on the best possible terms. ""I think that our negotiating position is something that is going to develop. It's going to develop I think before Article 50 is triggered and it will continue to develop after Article 50 is triggered. ""This is going to be a very complex negotiation by any terms and I think to say our position is set in tablets of stone at this stage is really quite unacceptable."" Mrs May told the conference on Sunday: ""We are going to be a fully independent, sovereign country - a country that is no longer part of a political union with supranational institutions that can override national parliaments and courts. ""And that means we are going, once more, to have the freedom to make our own decisions on a whole host of different matters, from how we label our food to the way in which we choose to control immigration.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit Party joins cross-party alliance for voting reform,"The parties have signed a declaration calling for the first-past-the-post method for Westminster elections to be replaced by a proportional system. They say a ""large group of ordinary people"" should meet and hear from experts before recommending changes. The public backed keeping the current system in a referendum in 2011. Calls to ditch first-past-the-post method - in which the candidate who wins the most votes in each of the UK's 650 constituencies is elected - in favour of the Alternative Vote system were overwhelmingly rejected by 68% to 32%. But supporters of voting reform have continued to campaign for change, arguing first-past-the-post fails to properly reflect the number of votes cast for smaller parties across the country - disenfranchises voters in safe seats where one party has historically dominated. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage became a convert to electoral reform after UKIP - which he lead for many years - only won a single seat in 2015, despite getting nearly four million votes His new party and six others - also including Plaid Cymru, The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Women's Equality Party - have now combined to form the Make Votes Matter Alliance in a fresh effort to push the issue up the political agenda. A handful of Labour MPs - including former frontbenchers Ben Bradshaw, Jon Cruddas and Clive Lewis - have also signed up, as has Tory MP Derek Thomas. 'Evidence-based' They have signed an agreement setting out the principles they believe should underpin an alternative system, stating that it must ""ensure that seats closely match votes, with parliamentary representation at least as proportional as the Scottish Parliament"". The Scottish Parliament has used the Additional Member System - a form of proportional representation - since its inception in 1999. Under the system, 73 MSPs are elected for individual constituencies under first-past-the-post, and a further 56 are chosen through a regional list system in which parties are allocated MSPs in proportion to their vote share. Voters get two votes each. In an effort to build public support for a ""sensible"" alternative to first-past-the-post, the alliance says an ""evidence-based, deliberative process"" was needed - with members of the public taking the lead through citizen's assemblies based on juries. Citizen's assemblies have been used in Ireland to address contentious issues, such as abortion, and Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart is among those to suggest they could be a way of breaking the Brexit deadlock. As an alternative, the alliance said a constitutional convention could be given the task - although it said it must be led by citizens and not political appointees. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said the UK's ""antique undemocratic voting system"" had contributed to the ""disastrous"" state of the country. ""In 1867, the Representation of the People Act saw a massive expansion of the male franchise,"" he said. ""People in the future might well look back to this event and see in it the seeds of the same scale of transformation, with a similar approach.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BP given consent for deep-water well North Uist west of Shetland,"The North Uist well is about 125km (78 miles) to the north west of the islands, at a depth of nearly 1,300m. The UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said it had thoroughly examined BP's environmental impact and emergency response plans. Environmental organisations have expressed concern at the news. Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: ""Oil and gas plays an important role in our economy and makes a significant contribution to our energy security, but exploration should not come at a cost to the environment. ""That is why, before giving consent, my department has very carefully scrutinised BP's plans and their emergency response measures to ensure their operations are conducted to the highest possible standards."" BP said: ""We welcome the government's approval; we have worked closely with the regulators throughout the planning and approval process for this well. ""We are investing billions of pounds in the long-term future of our UK business and exploration is an important part of this. ""Ensuring our activities are managed safely and responsibly is our absolute priority - we have been exploring west of Shetland since the early 1970s and have safely produced over 800 million barrels of oil from the area."" WWF Scotland director Dr Richard Dixon said: ""New deep-water drilling is just not worth the risk because we should be phasing out our use of oil instead of chasing ever more difficult sources. ""A major spill from this well would be a disaster for fishing, tourism and wildlife, with oil washing up in the Northern Isles and as far away as Norway."" Jonathan Hughes, director of the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: ""BP is a company making baby steps towards diversifying into a sustainable energy generation business. ""This is a business model it will absolutely need to embrace if it is to have a long-term future as a global corporate success story. ""Drilling under highly risky deep water off Shetland - one of Europe's most important marine wildlife areas - is a retreat into the past for BP, but also a wasted opportunity for Scotland. ""Their investment could instead have been made in clean, renewable alternatives."" He added: ""If Scotland wants to lead the world in the energy revolution we really need to move on from old oil to new technologies, a shift which will create many more skilled jobs in the long term, whilst protecting our oceans for future generations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nicky Verstappen cold case killing ends in jail after 22 years,"Jos Brech was found guilty by a court in the southern city of Maastricht of sexually abusing 11-year-old Nicky Verstappen and abducting him in acts that led to his death. But he was cleared of manslaughter, because of insufficient evidence. Nicky Verstappen disappeared from a tent in a summer camp in August 1998. His body was found in woodland the next day, 11 August. How a cold case was cracked The killing remained unsolved for 20 years, leaving the boy's parents Berthie and Peter Verstappen and his sister fighting for justice. The case was highlighted by legendary crime reporter Peter R. de Vries who used his popular TV programme to keep it in the public eye. Progress finally came through DNA evidence and a change in Dutch law that allowed a suspect to be traced through the DNA of a family member. Dutch police in the south-eastern province of Limburg had collected plenty of DNA from the crime scene but needed a match. Voluntary mass testing of 14,000 men in the Limburg area followed and Brech was identified through a relative's DNA. It later emerged that a military police officer had stopped him riding a bicycle in the dark hours after Nicky Verstappen's body had been found. Berthie Verstappen said the sentence was not enough for the family but told reporters ""the court has ensured we have a perpetrator and no longer a suspect... we're happy with that"". How Brech was arrested Brech, a survivalist, was reported missing in April 2018 but a tip-off revealed he had travelled to northern Spain and had been living in a tent in the woods. A Dutchman had seen him in the village of Castelltercol, north of Barcelona, and had spoken to him in July. He was finally put on trial and denied killing the boy, claiming he had accidentally stumbled on his body and straightened his clothes. Asked why he never told anyone, he replied: ""Who believes an ex-sex offender?"" Prosecutors asked the court to jail Brech for 15 years for manslaughter, followed by compulsory detention in a psychiatric facility. However, the court agreed with expert testimony that said Nicky Verstappen may have died of lack of oxygen and his death may have been unintentional as a result of his attacker putting his hand over the boy's mouth during sexual abuse. But the chairman of the court was unequivocal in telling the defendant that ""without your actions he would still have been alive on 11 August 1998"". Brech faces 12 years in jail for kidnapping and sexual abuse and a further six months for possession of child pornography. His lawyer has said he will appeal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Strictly: Aston's exit shocks fans but who's to blame?,"Aston landed a score of four from judge Craig Revel Horwood and found himself second bottom on the leaderboard with partner Janette Manrara. After the public vote, the pair ended up in the dance-off alongside Mollie King and partner AJ Pritchard. Head judge Shirley Ballas chose to save Mollie and AJ. Aston and Janette performed a Viennese waltz, while Mollie and AJ danced the foxtrot. Who's to blame? Despite the public vote being responsible for who ends up in the dance-off, fans took aim at Craig, Shirley and Janette for Aston's early demise. Former judge on the show, Alesha Dixon, was one of those fans. Shirley also came in for criticism, with some saying: ""I reckon #ShirleyBallas may be finishing off the show for good! We need #Len AGAIN!"" although others defended her, with one fan describing the head judge as ""a class act."" Some pointed out that people couldn't moan if they hadn't bothered to vote. One fan questioned the ""lousy choreography"" of Aston and Janette's dance and the decision to do a ""Viennese waltz in a Michael Jackson costume"". But others laid the blame firmly at Aston's door. Strictly champion Harry Judd wrote that while a score of four from Craig was too low, Aston didn't do himself any favours. Gabby Logan empathised with Aston - she caused a stir when she was sent home from the show back in 2007 after a dance-off with Penny Lancaster. Aston himself has been upbeat about his exit, saying ""life is great, I'm gutted obviously but... I'm not sad that it's over, I'm happy that it got to happen!"" But BBC reporter Betty Redondo said: ""There was a palpable shock among all the other contestants,"". The official BBC Strictly Twitter account even posted: ""Gone too soon"", and ran clips of the other celebrity contestants, seemingly bewildered by the decision. ""I was crying my eyes out... I can't believe they're gone,"" said fellow contestant Debbie McGee. Alexandra Burke's dance partner Gorka Marquez admitted he was ""heart-broken"" to see the pair leave.

"Scottish wildcats 'not wild' about snow, says SNH report","By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter Other predators such as pine martens were photographed in thick snow in the Cairngorms National Park. Zoologists from the University of Oxford worked with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on the project. Thirteen ""wild-living"" cats were photographed during the study, with four of them identified as wildcats. The other nine were thought to be hybrids, rather than pure Scottish wildcats. Nicknamed ""Highland tigers"", only about 400 pure wildcats are thought to survive in the wild. Disease, habitat loss and cross breeding with domestic cats has caused a decline in pure wildcats. Twenty camera traps were set up at locations on the Seafield and Strathspey Estates between February to May 2010. The team from SNH and Oxford's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) chose a type of camera that used an incandescent flash rather than an infra-red flash, which they said gave better quality and colour photographs at night. The estates within the national park were picked because of sightings of ""wild-living"" cats by workers in summer 2009. More than 3,000 photographs were taken, with 1,019 showing wildlife. Twenty-seven different species were identified, including capercaillie and tawny owls. Rabbits were the most frequently seen animal. In a report on the project's findings, the scientists said further research was needed to determine whether any significant seasonal differences affected the success of camera traps set for wildcats. The report said: ""It should also be noted that no cat photos were taken when the snow was greater than four inches deep, despite photographs of pine marten and prey species being captured. ""The European wildcat is known to have trouble moving around in snow and it is likely that the Scottish wildcat has a similar problem. ""Therefore, it is recommended that camera trapping for this species is not carried out in heavy snow at is unlikely to yield good results."" The report quoted the 2002 research study - The role of snow cover for European wildcat in Switzerland. Scientists involved in the Switzerland study tracked wildcats that moved to areas free of snow in winter and spring, but returned to higher altitudes once snow had melted away. Among Claude Mermod and Martin Liberek's conclusions was that prey was more available higher up hillsides in summer. They also suggested that the cats were less likely to be disturbed by humans further up hillsides. Because of threats to Scottish wildcat numbers in the wild, a scientist who was involved in cloning Dolly the sheep 15 years ago has started work on a new technique to clone wildcats. Embryologist Dr Bill Ritchie said the project could help protect the species. Midlothian-based Moredun Research Institute is involved. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which owns the Highland Wildlife Park, has previously suggested cloning wildcats.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Ms Lapper was born with no arms and shortened legs, which she said became an issue for her son at school. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Parys's mental health problems began when he started at secondary school in Sussex and pupils would give him strange looks because of her disability. ""The teenage years kicked in. He went from a small school to a massive school which I think had an impact,"" she said. ""We all know teenage years are hard; they change.

White House defends Ivanka Trump's personal travel amid lockdown,"The president's eldest daughter and her family travelled from Washington DC to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster to celebrate Passover. ""Her travel was not commercial,"" the White House said. ""She chose to spend a holiday in private with her family."" Both the nation's capital and New Jersey are under stay-at-home orders. Ms Trump, her husband and fellow administration adviser Jared Kushner, and their three children went to ""a closed-down facility considered to be a family home"", the statement to US media said. The White House added that the ""travel was no different than had she been traveling to/from work"", and ""the location was less populated than the surrounding area near her home"" in Washington. According to current federal coronavirus guidelines, people should ""avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits"". There are currently 653,825 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the nation, with nearly 31,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Washington DC has been under a stay-at-home order since 1 April, with residents told to leave home for ""essential"" travel only. New Jersey has been a hotspot for the outbreak, with over 71,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,100 deaths - second to its neighbour, New York, which is the epicentre of the pandemic in the US. Shortly ahead of her trip, Ms Trump, who is a senior adviser to the president, had told her Twitter followers: ""Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so."" The day before Passover, 7 April, she also shared a tweet by New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy that asked residents to celebrate health workers by ""by staying home for them"". Last month, Governor Murphy called on residents with second homes in the state to avoid travelling until restrictions eased. The Centers for Disease Control's guidance for the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut region also urges residents to ""refrain from non-essential domestic travel"". Last week, Scotland's chief medical officer resigned after similar travel during the pandemic. Dr Catherine Calderwood had apologised for taking two trips to her second home and initially said she planned to continue in the role, but quit on Sunday.

Brit Awards 2018: Kendrick Lamar's drug and sex references were muted by ITV,"""What's the point in having Kendrick Lamar perform on #BRITS if you're going to mute him every other word?"" tweeted JP, voicing the discontent of many. Many assumed that Lamar's songs - Feel and New Freezer - were muted due to bad language. But it seems the main issues were references to drugs and oral sex. Some muted sections featured mentions of ""bad dope"" and ""cocaine white"". The US superstar himself actually changed the most overt bad language in his lyrics - but fell foul of the censor's button for the drug words and oblique slang references to oral sex. Lamar's performance at the Brit Awards in London was broadcast on ITV on Wednesday almost an hour past the 21:00 watershed. Yet the decision was made to mute the audio 10 times during his performance - recalling an appearance by Kanye West in 2015 that also fell foul of the broadcaster's censors. Asked about the decision to mute parts of the songs, ITV said the ceremony was broadcast ""to a wide audience"". ""We have always used a short time delay and audio muting to deal with language viewers may consider unsuitable,"" a spokeswoman said. Lamar's performance also included a man taking a baseball bat to the windshield of an expensive-looking sports car. On Thursday morning, media watchdog Ofcom said it had received 74 complaints from viewers about Lamar's segment - some of whom feared this might incite criminal behaviour and property damage, and some complaining about implied bad language. BBC music reporter Mark Savage described the car stunt as the evening's ""biggest metaphor failure"". ""His intention was to make a statement about the emptiness of status symbols and the trappings of fame,"" he wrote. ""But, with most viewers unable to hear his lyrics, it came off as 'I'm so rich I can afford to smash up this very expensive car live on TV.'"" The BBC understands the car in question was a £20,000 replica of a Lamborghini Murcielago. The end of Rag 'N' Bone Man's speech after he won best British single was also muted after the singer - real name Rory Graham - used the f-word. Yet Stormzy's use of an offensive Jamaican slang word went out uncensored when he took to the stage to accept the award for best British male at 20:32 GMT. ITV said: ""The use of this word during Stormzy's acceptance speech was not recognised at the time. We will address this for repeats.""

Police swoop on suspected darknet fake banknote buyers,"More than 26,000 fake banknotes had been bought from - and delivered by - the gang, according to the agency. The estimated face value of the notes was about 1.3m euros ($1.4m; £1.1m). A total of 11 arrests have been made and a further 33 suspects have been detained for questioning. Europol said a total of 36 homes, across Germany, Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain, had been searched. A print shop in Lower Saxony, Germany, said to have specialised in fake documents, has also been dismantled. To minimise the risk of the suspects alerting each other, the police carried out the raids over a short period of time between 9 and 11 December. The effort was a follow-up to an earlier operation, dubbed Deep Money, which had targeted the crime gang involved in making and distributing the fake currency. In September, it was announced that five suspected members of the Portugal-based crime ring had been arrested and materials including ultraviolet inks and holographic bands, involved in the production of the fake currency, had been seized. That had involved the extradition from Colombia of the alleged gang chief. A spokeswoman for Europol told the BBC that many of the counterfeit bank notes had been sold via Wall Street Market. The online marketplace had operated on the Tor network, which requires special software to access and meant the site had not been indexed by regular search engines such as Google. The fake notes had been traded for cryptocurrencies, which buyers had used to try to keep their identities hidden. Sales had been carried out via private messages and other encrypted chat platforms in a further effort to hide the activity. Wall Street Market was taken offline by the German Federal Criminal Police in May, after being in business for about three years. The authorities said that illegal drugs and malware had also been sold via the site. Earlier in the year, the European Central Bank reported that counterfeiting Euro bank notes appeared to be on the decline. It based its analysis on the fact that a total of 251,000 counterfeit banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in the first half of 2019 - about a third less than for the same period in 2017.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Port of Dover facing 'unnecessary holdups' on 1 January,"""Without this funding it's going to make the transition more challenging than it is today,"" said Doug Bannister. The government said it had already made ""unprecedented"" new investments in port infrastructure. Several UK ports, including Dover, are facing congestion already. And in two weeks' time, new rules will govern trade and travel between the UK and the EU. ""The port is as prepared as we can be. We've been at this for four years now,"" said Mr Bannister. He added that questions remained over how ready businesses were to trade under the new conditions. ""That is going to be the unknown... until we see it happening,"" he said. Around 9,000 trucks pass through the port of Dover every day, transporting nearly 20% of all the goods sold in the UK. Congestion and delays around the UK's ports have already caused concern there could be serious disruption when Britain's trading relationship with the EU changes at the end of this year. However Mr Bannister said that January was typically a slow period which might allow new systems to bed in before cargo volumes started to pick up again. ""We are trying to move ourselves through the greatest period of uncertainty that this facility has seen,"" he said. On Wednesday, the government turned down a request for £33m of funding to facilitate extra French passport checks on people travelling out of Dover. Dover had requested the extra support as part of the Port Infrastructure Fund, which is designed to smooth the switch to the new rules. After 1 January, anyone travelling from the UK to France will face stricter checks and stamps in their passports. ""Being denied the funding for this programme - what that does mean is that we could see increased friction and increased hold ups while we get through the opening period of the transition,"" said Mr Bannister. However, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, responding to a question in the House of Commons, said: ""The funding in the port infrastructure fund was specifically available for projects that were due to be delivered by July next year, when full import controls will be in place. Dover was bidding for some infrastructure that would be complete by 2023."" The government has made ""an unprecedented"" £470m available for new infrastructure in and around the UK's ports, a spokesperson said. Current congestion around the port of Dover was due to the extra pressure of the Christmas trading period, firms stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period, and overspill from problems in other ports including Felixstowe, Mr Bannister said. The UK and the EU are still locked in talks over a trade deal to take effect at the end of this year. Although the UK left the EU in January, an 11-month-long transition period was agreed during which previous trade relations would continue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Air pollution: Houses on polluted street face demolition,"Recorded levels of nitrogen dioxide on the A472 at Hafodyrynys were higher than anywhere else apart from central London 2015 and 2016. These far exceed World Health Organisation guidelines. Next week, Caerphilly council's cabinet will be asked to approve plans to purchase the 23 worst-affected homes. The A472, between Newbridge and Pontypool, suffers pollution from an estimated 21,000 vehicle movements a day. There have been many proposals for improving air quality, including buying and demolishing the houses and businesses, which would cost about £4.5m. This was the Welsh Government's preferred option. But the council initially rejected the idea saying it could only offer market value for a compulsory purchase. Leader Dave Poole said the low value of properties because of the pollution could put home owners into ""financial difficulty"" buying elsewhere. But after an agreement with the Welsh Government, the local authority now plans to buy the worst-affected houses on the south side for 150% of market value. ""The council has always maintained that we must put the interests of Hafodyrynys residents first,"" Mr Poole said. ""This proposal really is a 'win-win' situation for all concerned and we are pleased that the Welsh Government has responded to our calls for funding to provide residents with a fair financial package."" Deanna Hardwick, who lives on the road, said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the plans. ""This is my home, my children were born here and we do have a life here,"" she said. ""But on the other hand the road and the situation isn't going to get better any time soon, and it's made our properties worthless, so even if we wanted to move in the future we couldn't."" She said the thought of having to look for somewhere to live was ""very stressful"". ""Can we afford to buy somewhere?"" she added. ""My husband and I still have a mortgage and a long time left on it. ""I've got three small children and they would love to go outside on bikes. ""If we move and we do get the chance then they can get out and be more social."" Demolition of the properties would allow the council to achieve air quality compliance by 2022. A report will be considered by the council's cabinet next week before it submits a plan to the Welsh Government.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Drug mule cat gets caught in Russian jail,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring After a chase that was caught on camera, the cat was captured and an inspection of the collar revealed that it contained a brown substance suspected to be hashish, according to the Izvestia newspaper. The local prison service said there was another incident of a cat being used as a drug mule in the same institution in 2010, in which the hidden cargo was heroin, reports Ria News. You may also be interested in: The report explains that the cat belonged to one of the inmates. It was released to acquaintances in the outside world who kept the animal hungry for several days before it was let loose near the colony. The hungry cat was trying to reach its owner when it got caught. Twist in the tale Those details closely resemble a more recent case from 2018, which made headlines earlier in October. It was reported that the alleged feline courier in a drugs smuggling case in the Tula region escaped from detention, dealing a blow to the ongoing investigation. A former inmate hatched a plan, according to the Russian interior ministry, to establish a channel for delivering drugs using a prison pet. The animal which was born in the facility was taken out by an inmate upon his release and handed over to associates outside the prison. The new owners allegedly fitted it with a collar stuffed with hashish and amphetamine and sent it on its way back to the prison. But the furry drug trafficker was caught and placed under the care of a local animal centre. Two suspects were detained. When it became clear that the cat had escaped, a pet keeper explained that it was chased away by dogs. The cat was meant to be used as a key piece of evidence for both the prosecution and the defence. A lawyer for the defence told the Kommersant newspaper that he wouldn't now be able to conduct a planned experiment to see if the cat would have been able carry out the delivery.

Row erupts after nine die in south-east Turkish bomb,"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the ""terrorists"" behind the attack - implicitly blaming the Kurdish rebel PKK. Fighting between the government and PKK has escalated recently. But the group declared a ceasefire last month which is not due to end until next week. The PKK denied planting the bomb, blaming groups loyal to the government. The blast happened near the city of Hakkari, bordering Iran and Iraq, where Kurdish rebels have been active. The civilian minibus was passing through the village of Gecitli and the passengers are believed to have been villagers. The wounded included a 15-month-old baby. Denial Hakkari regional Governor Muammer Turker said Turkish troops were hunting those believed to be behind the attack. Prime Minister Erdogan said: ""These kinds of incidents will not deter us. Terrorism has a cost but it will not remain unanswered."" The PKK, designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the US, has waged a 26-year insurgency against the Turkish state which has claimed 40,000 lives. A ceasefire it declared in August is not due to expire until 20 September. The ceasefire followed a period of violence between the rebels and the military, which had escalated since the PKK called off a previous truce in June. The rebels suggested the attack may have been the work of state forces. ""We have nothing to do with this explosion and we do not target civilians,"" Roj Welat, a spokesman for the PKK, told the Associated Press. ""The Turkish government and the groups loyal to it are behind these attacks as part of their attempts to distort the image of the PKK,"" he said. Such allegations of black operations by the military to discredit the insurgents are commonplace in the south-east, said the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul. Proper investigations of such allegations are very rare, he added. Autonomy call In an interview for Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this week, PKK leader Murat Karayilan said the group would accept autonomous status for the Kurdish region like that possessed by Catalonia in Spain. Catalonia has its own police force and parliament. ""If we obtain a Catalonia[-style] autonomy, we would lay down our weapons and hand them over to the United Nations,"" he was quoted as saying. The PKK leader added that the group's strategy depended on whether or not Turkey continued ""attacks and detentions of Kurds"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish deposit return scheme plan praised,"By Andrew BlackBusiness presenter, BBC Good Morning Scotland Proposals for a drinks container scheme would see customers pay a small charge, which is refunded when the bottle is returned to a shop. Truls Haug, UK boss of Norwegian firm Tomra's deposit return business, said he was ""quite a fan"" of the plan. Scottish ministers are currently considering their next steps. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham has said the results of a recent consultation on deposit return show the public would back such a scheme, which under the current proposals would have a minimum deposit of more than 15 pence. One of the aims of the consultation was to help determine what range of materials - such as plastic, metal or glass glass - should be included. A decision on this will be announced at a later date. Mr Haug, whose company has a focus on making ""reverse vending"" machines, which take in used bottles, said of the Scottish government plan: ""I'm quite a fan of what they are presenting. ""I think if they act on what they have stated earlier, I believe this could be a leading example going forward."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""They are one of the first states that focus on the recycling more than reducing littering. ""If you focus on recycling, the littering will automatically be reduced. ""But if you only focus on littering, that doesn't mean you recycle the material. ""So I think they have the correct approach to a deposit return scheme."" The Scottish government has been working to take forward the scheme amid increasing concern about the amount of recyclable waste being buried in the ground. Mr Haug, managing director of Tomra Collection Solutions UK & Ireland, said the key to an effective deposit return scheme was to make it simple and include a wide a range of containers - like glass, plastic and paper. He said: ""Lithuania had a recycling rate of 34% prior to the introduction of deposit, and they reached about 90% within two years."" Scotland was the first part of the UK to commit to a deposit return scheme, and the UK, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have now set out their own plans. The idea of a UK deposit return scheme has seen some controversy, with some retailers accused of trying to water down the proposals.

Brazilian press reacts to latest leaked tape scandal,"The scandal erupted less than two weeks after Michel Temer took over as the acting president of Brazil. The story dominates the top headlines of the country's major media outlets, with many newspapers devoting several articles to the latest revelation. Right-leaning newspaper O Globo leads with the headline ""11 days later: Recording topples Juca, challenges Temer and alarms the PMDB"", in reference to upheaval now facing the country's largest political party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), to which both the president and the minister belong. O Globo's online coverage takes a different approach and highlights interim President Temer's reaction to the scandal. The site features an editorial entitled ""Temer's hour"", which argues that Mr Temer's presidency is legitimate but that he would be better off removing Mr Juca from office permanently. Many see this latest revelation as a serious challenge for the interim president. Carolina Bahia, a columnist for newspaper Zero Hora, writes that ""Michel Temer has hardly started to govern and already faces his first scandal"" in a piece entitled ""Juca is just the beginning"". Centre-left publication Carta Capital takes the same view, with the headline ""Juca: Understand the first crisis of Temer's government"". The article notes that Mr Juca saw President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment as an opportunity to divert attention away from the massive corruption investigation dubbed Lava Jato, or Operation Car Wash. Folha de Sao Paulo, which first published news of the leaked recordings, also notes the link to Ms Rousseff's impeachment. In his weekly column for Folha, left-wing politician Marcelo Freixo says the recordings ""show that the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff had nothing to do with combating corruption"". Several publications feature Ms Rousseff's reaction to the leaked tapes. Centre-right daily Correio Braziliense writes ""Dilma says the recording shows the need to remove her from post so as to stop the Lava Jato corruption investigation"", in an article entitled ""Juca's audio is evidence of a 'coup'"". There has been no lack of reaction on social media over this latest revelation in Brazil's political drama, with Mr Juca remaining one of the top trends on Twitter in the hours following the leak. President Temer is also the focus of attention, and the hashtag #ForaTemer [Temer Out] is prominent amongst those who oppose the interim government. Other Twitter users are highlighting angles that they say the newspapers have missed, namely that members of the Supreme Court (STF) may have been aware of Mr Juca's plan. US journalist Glenn Greenwald, who is based in Brazil, tweets ""Brazil's media keeps focusing on Juca's desire to end Lava Jato, ignoring his *way-more-important* conversations with military and STF judges"".

Stephen Ward: Lloyd Webber 'proud' as new musical opens,"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Joining the cast on stage at the curtain call, Lord Lloyd-Webber told the celebrity-filled audience: ""I'm very proud of this show."" One critic praised the ""instantly catchy"" songs while another found them ""below-par"". The show is booking at the Aldwych Theatre until 1 March 2014. The opening night audience included Dame Judi Dench, Elaine Paige, Arlene Phillips, James Corden, Jimmy Carr and film director Tom Hooper. Stephen Ward, an osteopath and socialite, was instrumental in the Profumo sex scandal, which threatened to topple the Conservative government in 1963. Put on trial for living off immoral earnings, Ward took an overdose of tablets and died three days after being found guilty. ""This was an iconic moment of the 1960s,"" director Sir Richard Eyre told the BBC on opening night. ""It's the watershed between a repressive Puritanism and an explosive political and sexual liberalism. ""I know it was 50 years ago, but if you look at events where the conspiracy of the press, the police and politics come together you have to ask 'how much has changed in the last 50 years?'"" The show presents Ward, played by Alexander Hanson, as the victim of a gross miscarriage of justice. It begins with him as a waxwork in the chamber of horrors at Blackpool's Madame Tussauds - stood next to Adolf Hitler. The Telegraph's Charles Spencer said Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical had ""delightful tunes, winning performances and an unexpected dash of mischief"". ""My hunch is that those who like Lloyd Webber best when he's doomy-gloomy won't warm to this show, but that those who have previously found him overwrought will find this sharp, funny - and, at times, genuinely touching - musical highly enjoyable."" He said also praised Hanson's ""superb"" Ward and the performances of Charlotte Spencer as showgirl Christine Keeler and Charlotte Blackledge as Mandy Rice-Davies. Ms Rice-Davies, one of the witnesses in the Stephen Ward trial, has been an adviser on the production, and attended on opening night. The Guardian's Michael Billington said the show ""undeniably belonged"" to Hanson, adding: ""It is not his fault if we feel that this story of the breaking of a social butterfly on a wheel needs a melodic astringency that is not exactly Lloyd Webber's forte."" The Independent's Paul Taylor said Lloyd Webber's ""eclectic score has its witty touches and the odd surge of poignancy"". But Variety's David Benedict wondered how the fallout from Britain's most notorious sex-and-politics scandal could have been ""turned into something so flaccid?"" He said: ""The cast do their level best and sing well but neither the meandering, below-par songs nor the slack storytelling create tension. ""Prior to opening, there was much internet chatter about the undramatic nature of the title. Sadly, lack of drama turns out to be the hallmark of the show.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Llandeilo bypass delayed until 2025 by Welsh Government,"Construction had been planned to start on the £50m Llandeilo road by the start of 2019. Plaid Cymru accused the Welsh Government of breaking a promise made in a budget deal with the party in 2016. The Welsh Government said it remained committed to the scheme. Residents in Llandeilo have been calling for action for four decades - the town suffers from congestion from lorries driving through the main street. The route, which is on the A483, is currently used as a route from Swansea to join the A40 to the Midlands. Transport Minister Ken Skates had promised ""shovels in the ground"" by the end of 2019. Earlier this year it was confirmed work had been delayed until autumn 2022 at least. But in a letter to the area's Member of the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, Mr Skates laid out a new potential timetable for the project, with short, medium and long-term measures. Constructing a ""Llandeilo relief road"" is listed as a long-term measure, pegged for at least five years away. Short-term measures, to be implemented within a year, include new traffic lights, removal of parking and loading bays on Rhosmaen Street and additional public parking. Medium-term measures would include ""footway enhancements"", improved bus connections from Llandeilo railway station and a ""Ffairfach relief road"" at Ysgol Bro Dinefwr. Mr Price, MS for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said: ""This is yet another broken promise and the Welsh Government has completely undermined the agreement it entered into with Plaid Cymru in 2016. ""To face a third delay on this project is completely unacceptable - particularly as air pollution levels are higher than the national standards, and the problem will be only be getting worse."" The bypass's inclusion in the budget for 2017-2018 had been criticised by Labour MS Lee Waters at the time, who warned about ""pork barrel"" budget deals. Mr Waters, who is now a deputy transport minister working in Mr Skates' department, cautioned against offering schemes ""for political parties to show they have exerted influence"". The letter added that a consultation event on the scheme had been delayed from earlier in the year, and is now being planned for September. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""To ensure we deliver the maximum benefits we are carefully following detailed appraisal processes, as well as ensuring the feedback from stakeholders and local voices is taken into account. This is in the context of restrictions in place from coronavirus which are affecting the way we can work. ""We continue to work with stakeholders, including Carmarthenshire County Council, to make improvements in the short, medium and long-term. We remain committed to delivering the scheme as part of wider efforts to improve transport in the area.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Culture shock for Stormont's youngest MLA, Megan Fearon","Mark DevenportPolitical editor, Northern Ireland@markdevenporton Twitter Whilst the 86-year-old Queen made her way through the rain towards Enniskillen, 20-year-old Megan Fearon was preparing to take her place as the youngest member of the Stormont Assembly. Ms Fearon has been co-opted as an MLA, replacing Conor Murphy in Newry and Armagh as part of the party's phasing out of double jobbing by its MPs. Sinn Fein say Megan's youth won't be any barrier to their new MLA doing her duty. Conor Murphy says he is ""delighted to endorse this bright, energetic and intelligent young woman... I know that going into the Assembly will be something completely new to Megan and, while this would daunt many of Megan's age, I am confident that she will rise admirably to any challenges set."" However a glance at Megan's Twitter account gives a sense of what a culture shock a new life at Stormont might prove for the young Sinn Fein activist. Back in May, she was stuck in the university library praying for the end of her exams. She messaged a friend: 'I am dead on thursday in Economics,have done hardly anything!! I'll be coming home on friday like a Zombie!!' As the end approached she continued: ""Time flies! This time tomorrow il have my economics outta the way and will officially be unemployed! haha"" It's fair to say that in early May Megan hadn't been briefed on her potential role in Sinn Fein's double jobbing strategy, as she tweeted: ""Can't sleep! On Google looking at ways to spend my life for the next few years at least! Really starting to love the idea of #TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language)."" In between tweets about Desperate Housewives and Sabrina - The Teenage Witch, Ms Fearon makes clear her views on feminism and republicanism and it's clear she has been a long term Sinn Fein activist. ' Back in April last year, prior to the Queen's historic visit to the Irish Republic, she commented: ""So its official..the queen will visit on 17th May, 37 years to the day after the dublin & monaghan bombings! I feel ill..."" That was then, this is now and I'm sure by the time she arrives in the Stormont chamber Megan Fearon will be on message - once Sinn Fein has worked out exactly what the party line is on Desperate Housewives.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Venezuela opposition wins EU's top human rights prize,"The president of the European Union Parliament , Antonio Tajani, said many people in Venezuela had been deprived of their fundamental freedoms. He called the president a ""dictator"" and said: ""We cannot remain silent."" The freedom of thought prize is awarded annually in memory of Andrei Sakharov, a Soviet scientist and dissident. Venezuela is mired in a deep political and economic crisis which has left the South American country deeply polarised between supporters of the socialist government headed by President Nicolas Maduro, and its opponents. More than 120 people were killed in protest-related violence during a spate of anti-government demonstrations earlier this year. 'Total support' Announcing the recipients of the prize, Mr Tajani said that ""we must defend democracy, freedom and human rights"". ""And, for that reason, we have decided to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the democratic opposition, recalling our total support for the National Assembly of Venezuela - a democratically-elected parliament - the only parliament democratically elected,"" Mr Tajani said. Mr Tajani was referring to the current stand-off between Venezuela's National Assembly, dominated by opposition parties, and the constituent assembly, made up exclusively of government supporters. The latter is a ""superbody"" and its powers trump those of the executive and legislative. The constituent assembly has been controversial from the start with critics of Mr Maduro denouncing it as a way to bypass the opposition-dominated National Assembly. While the Sakharov Prize praised the National Assembly for its ""exceptional contribution to the fight for human rights"", the prize is unlikely to change the government's attitude towards the opposition-controlled body. The government routinely dismisses criticism by international bodies as ""meddling"" or lies. In September, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza accused the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights of lying after the office published a report highlighting the excessive use of force by Venezuelan security forces at anti-government protests. The Sakharov Prize also praised the role of political prisoners in Venezuela and those protesting for freedom. The European Parliament said in a statement that it wanted to ""express its proximity to and pay tribute to the Venezuelan people: to all those who have been unjustly jailed for expressing their opinion, to those struggling to survive on a daily basis because of a brutal regime, to those families in mourning because they have lost loved ones in months of uninterrupted protests for freedom."" The €50,000-prize ($58,000; £45,000) will be awarded on 13 December in Strasbourg. Last year's prize was awarded to two Yazidi women who escaped sexual enslavement by so-called Islamic State (IS) in Iraq.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Q&A: What now for staff at clinical waste firm HES?,"Healthcare Environmental Services (HES) in Shotts served all its staff with redundancy notices a week ago. The firm lost its contracts with NHS Scotland and 17 NHS trusts in England after it was found to be stockpiling clinical waste. So what happens now for the failed company and the workers who have lost their jobs? Who is helping the former HES staff? A string of public bodies, including North Lanarkshire Council and the government agency Skills Development Scotland, are leading efforts to try and get new jobs for all the affected HES staff. Are the workers owed any money? The workers are owed wages which were due on 28 December last year and many are also due overtime payments. Will they ever see the wages owed to them? It is complicated. Normally when a firm goes bust workers can claim statutory redundancy from the Redundancy Payment Service (RPS), which is run by the UK government and paid for by the UK-wide National Insurance Fund. The RPS was set up to help to provide a way in which ex-employees could get the money they are owed in a much shorter timescale than waiting for a firm's assets to be sold, but there is a catch. What is the catch? The RPS cannot process a claim without a reference number from an insolvency practitioner and the directors of HES have not so far made such an appointment, and failed to answer questions on whether they will do so. The other issue is whether any insolvency practitioner would actually take on the job. Why wouldn't an insolvency firm want to take on the job? In short the problem is the tonnes of clinical waste from private contracts lying at the HES plant in Shotts. A recent legal test case made clear that meeting environmental regulations should be given priority by liquidators over paying back creditors. In addition, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has said that it will pursue any insolvency practitioner appointed by HES to ensure its enforcement notices over the storage of waste are complied with. All of this doesn't make the HES job very appealing for the insolvency trade and it may be the case HES directors are struggling to get someone to take on the work. What happens next for the workers? If no insolvency practitioner is appointed then one option open to the workers to raise an employment tribunal action against HES, either as a group or individuals, to get a redundancy payout. If the tribunal rules in their favour then the RPS would consider this ruling as an alternative to a reference number from an insolvency practitioner, and could then award the workers the money they are owed. And what happens to the waste in the HES plant? Sepa has said it is monitoring conditions at Shotts and at the firm's other Scottish site in Dundee, adding that it is investigating whether criminal offences had been committed.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Royals race America's Cup yachts around NZ harbour,"They joined the crews of America's Cup yachts for two races in Waitemata harbour off the coast of Auckland. Earlier, the royal couple visited an air force base, sharing parenting tips with serving airmen and women. Prince William joked that his eight-month-old son, Prince George, had already received a string of marriage offers in New Zealand. On Wednesday, Prince George attended his first official public engagement at a ""crawl-about"" with babies of similar age at Government House in Wellington. He will not be making any more appearances during his parents' 19-day tour of New Zealand and Australia, but has continued to be a focus of attention. Take care Prince William and Catherine took part in two yacht races on Friday, being pitted against each other on America's Cup class 80ft sloops. Catherine joked with her husband before the start, warning William to ""take care"" as they set off. He replied: ""Yeah, see you later."" Catherine was joined by Dean Barker, Team New Zealand captain and a crew member of his nation's 2000 America's Cup team. Their team won both races.

Storm Callum: Amber weather alert issued for Wales,"An amber warning for heavy rain has been issued for most of south Wales bringing an increased likelihood of travel delays, power cuts and potential risks to life and property. It comes on top of a yellow Met Office warning for high winds and heavy rain across most of the country. Arriva Trains Wales is amending services and ferry crossings have been cancelled because of the storm threat. The Met Office warnings run from the early hours of Friday into Saturday and a number of flood alerts have been issued across south and west Wales. The worst of the rain will be on south and south-facing hills, with 120mm to 160mm (4.7in to 6.3in) predicted, according to the forecaster. High winds with gusts of 50mph to 60mph around exposed coasts and hills are also forecast. Amber warnings can mean: Natural Resources Wales (NRW) warned that weather conditions at sea could also cause flooding with large waves, strong winds and a tidal surge. Those adverse conditions saw Irish Ferries cancel six crossings between Holyhead and Dublin while Stena Lines cancelled services between Fishguard and Rosslare. Due to the threat of coastal flooding, Arriva Trains Wales and Network Rail have amended services on the Swansea to Carmarthen line from 07:00 BST to 11:00 and after 19:00. Arriva said only very limited replacement buses will be available and advised people to check the latest advice before travelling. No trains will operate between Machynlleth and Newtown after 10:00 on Friday until Monday morning. Arriva has also cancelled services between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog on both Friday and Saturday. On Thursday, Rhondda Cynon Taf council had teams of workers filling 2,500 sandbags and asked residents to clear drains and gullies to help prevent flooding. Meanwhile Carmarthenshire council urged drivers to take extra care along the coast. NRW said its emergency response teams were checking flood defences, clearing gullies and ditches and installing temporary defences. With the storm set to move north during Friday and Saturday, electricity distributor SP Energy Networks issued advice in case of power cuts in North Wales. Director Stephen Stewart said: ""Even though power cuts are rare, during times of heavy rain and flooding they become more likely. ""Preparations are well underway to ensure we have engineers and equipment and customer care teams on hand to respond to faults should they come in."" The yellow warning runs from 05:00 BST on Friday until midnight on Saturday and the amber warning from 06:00 on Friday until 18:00 on Saturday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Private schools extend lead in entrants to university,"By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter Government figures show 85% of private school pupils went to higher education, compared with 62% of those from state schools by the age of 19 in 2013-14. The figures for entrance to the most selective universities were even starker at 64% and 23% respectively. Tuition fees, funded by state-sponsored loans, had just been raised to £9,000. The figures, published by the Department for Education, reveal a drop from 66% to 62% in state school pupils progressing to university between 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. It was part of a nine percentage point drop from 71% in state school pupils carrying on into higher education since 2009-2010, the figures showed. But overall there were still many thousands more state school pupils going to university in 2013-14 at 212,065, than private school pupils at 24,990. 'Opportunities' The report, Widening Participation in Higher Education: 2016, noted: ""The 2013-14 cohort was the first cohort where all students were affected by the change in tuition fees in 2012-13."" Ministers have repeatedly claimed that the introduction of higher fees did not deter pupils from heading to university. The figures were released days after maintenance grants were replaced with loans for students from poor backgrounds in England. They replaced payments of around £3,500 with loans, which will have to be paid back at the end of an undergraduate course, once graduates are earning more than £21,000. But the government highlighted that more disadvantaged youngsters, those on free school meals, are going on to university. Decline Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""We are seeing record numbers of disadvantaged young people going to university and benefiting from the real opportunities that our world-class universities can offer. ""But, with a gap still persisting depending on a student's background, there is still more work to do to build a society that works for everyone. ""Everyone in our country should be allowed to rise as far as their talents will take them, whoever they are and wherever they're from. We will not rest until every young person in our country has the chance to fulfil their promise."" Sorana Vieru, vice president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said: ""This government has continued with the coalition's rhetoric that high fees and debt have not put students off going into higher education. ""Despite research showing that students from non-selective state schools being the most likely to succeed at university, their participation rates have been in decline since 2010. ""It is clear that students from non-selective state schools are most likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""For a government that talks the talk on social mobility, it needs to seriously consider the effect its market reforms are having on higher education participation.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Groupe Eurotunnel bid to run French ports,"A tendering process under way will see the successful bidder awarded the Calais-Boulogne ports concession to run the ports for 50 years. Rival operator P&O Ferries said the move could raise competition issues. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said he was deeply concerned that increased competition would affect British ferry firms and put a squeeze on local jobs. The port is currently run by the Calais chamber of commerce, Cote d'Opale. Groupe Eurotunnel confirmed a bid would be submitted in the coming months. Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said the cross-Channel rail firm's parent company, Groupe Eurotunnel, would make the bid. He said the firm currently ran the cross-Channel shuttle service and also operated transport services and other port infrastructure around France. The Calais-Boulogne bid was ""entirely in keeping with the group strategy"" and the company had background and experience in the field, he added. He said: ""This is not us competing with P&O or with anybody on the [Dover-Calais ferry route] short strait. This is port infrastructure management and a completely different issue."" 'Deep concern' But Brian Rees, P&O spokesman, said the Office of Fair Trading had already referred Eurotunnel's recent purchase of former SeaFrance ships, which are now run as MyFerryLink Ferries, to the Competition Commission. He said: ""Given the tunnel's scale in the market as the biggest cross-Channel carrier and the fact they own ferries now, it raises questions about competition and regulation."" And he added that ""we [P&O] would be talking to our biggest competitor about our arrangements to use the port"", if the Eurotunnel bid was successful. Conservative MP for Dover and Deal Mr Elphicke, said: ""Eurotunnel effectively own the [former] Seafrance ferry company. Now they want to own the French ports of Calais and Boulogne."" He said: ""I am deeply concerned that this is too much control of the cross-Channel freight market in the hands of one operator."" He said the situation should be investigated by the Competition Commission and the European Competition Authorities. Mr Elphicke said the move could have an impact on ferry lines P&O and DFDS, which were predominantly British employers, and put a squeeze on British jobs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Ecuador sees massive surge in deaths in April,"The government said 6,700 people died in Guayas province in the first two weeks of April, far more than the usual 1,000 deaths there in the same period. Guayas is home to Guayaquil - a key port and the part of the country worst-hit by Covid-19. Footage obtained by the BBC showed residents forced to store bodies in their homes for up to five days. They said authorities had been unable to keep up with the huge rise in deaths, leaving corpses wrapped in sheets in family homes and even in the streets. Authorities last week began distributing thousands of cardboard coffins in Guayaquil. A dedicated helpline was also set up for families that needed a corpse removed from their home. Jorge Wated, the head of a police unit created to tackle the problem, said earlier this week that 771 bodies had been removed from houses in the city. According to the government's figures, 14,561 people have died in Guayas province since the beginning of March from all causes. The province normally sees 2,000 deaths a month on average. Ecuador as a whole has had 8,225 confirmed cases of coronavirus to date, according to Johns Hopkins University, though a lack of widespread testing means this is likely a significant undercount. Across Latin America, Covid-19 has been dubbed a rich person's disease. A virus introduced to the region by affluent parts of society who had been travelling abroad. The case of Ecuador is no different but experts have suggested that the country's deep ties with Spain and transport links between there and Guayaquil, a key port, could be partly responsible for higher numbers. Indeed, the first recorded case was of an Ecuadorean woman returning from Spain. But the high death toll is also a devastating consequence of the combination of an overburdened healthcare system and a deeply unequal society which means not everybody is able - or willing - to socially distance and stop work. Authorities argue they were quick to impose strict regulations and people chose to disregard measures but experts argue more could be done - and one thing that could help is testing. While Ecuador is not the worst offender in the region, low testing rates have made it very difficult to understand how the virus has moved through communities, some of which have been devastated by the high death toll. Ecuador's vice president, Otto Sonnenholzer, apologised to the nation earlier this month for the government's slow response to the pandemic. ""We have seen images that should never have happened, and as your public servant I apologise,"" Mr Sonnenholzer said. Guayaquil is densely populated and has high levels of poverty, with many residents living in close proximity.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Historic annual mop fair returns to Cirencester market place,"The fair is a tradition that dates back to the Middle Ages and involved farm workers, labourers and servants. Cirencester Town Council said more recently, the event has become a funfair for the community to enjoy. This year, Nichols Amusements of the Showmen's Guild is celebrating its centenary of running the event. This special anniversary will be announced by Cirencester's newly-appointed town crier John Lawrence to herald the opening of the week-long fair. Local historian Dr Robert Heaven said: ""For me, the arrival of the mop in Ciren always heralds the onset of Autumn. With nights drawing in and the air crisp with a slight chill. ""It cheers my heart to see the bright lights and to hear the sound of heavy machinery overlaid with the voices of excited revellers on the streets of our old town."" Dr Heaven said mop fairs date from the time of Edward III, and his attempt to regulate the labour market in 1351. After the Black Death pandemic decimated the workforce, hiring fairs introduced prospective employers to agricultural labourers and servants who would gather in the street and the market place, sporting a badge or tool to signify their skill. Shepherds held a crook or a tuft of wool, cowmen brought wisps of straw, dairymaids carried a milking stool or pail and housemaids held brooms or mops, hence the name ""mop fair"". Employers would move amongst the workers touting for work - discussing experience and terms, and once agreement was reached the employer would give the employee a small token of money, known as the ""fasten-penny"", usually a shilling, which ""fastened"" the contract for a year. The employee would then remove the item signifying their trade and wear bright ribbons to indicate they had been hired. The stalls selling food and drink and offering games to play would tempt the employee to spend their token money. The event became a major festival and eventually was condemned for encouraging drunkenness and immorality. Dr Heaven said: ""My earliest memories of the mop are watching its arrival on October Sunday afternoons and feeling a build-up of anticipation and excitement as each lorry and trailer pulled into the Forum. ""I remember next morning at school, when various tales, legends and apocryphal stories about the mop would be exchanged in the playground as we looked forward to late afternoon and the magic that had transformed our market place and the Forum. ""'Fun fair was a major feature from the outset, and records and early newspapers have many accounts of drunkenness and debauchery from the outset. ""I never experienced any trouble at the mop, other than a belly-ache from an excess of toffee apples and sticky pink candy floss.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Facebook rejects businessman's jab advert,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones wanted to raise awareness about the importance of being vaccinated and shared a picture of him receiving the jab. But when he tried to promote the post on Facebook, it was rejected because it said the content was ""shocking"". Facebook said it had made a mistake and the advert had since been approved. ""Our team processes millions of posts and images daily and occasionally we make a mistake. We have restored the ad and apologise to Mr Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones for any inconvenience caused,"" said a spokesman. Mr Emmanuel-Jones runs The Black Farmer, a firm selling meats and deli products from his Devon farm. He had his vaccination last week and posted the picture to his personal Facebook page. But he said he wanted to ""do something more to raise awareness"" and reach a wider audience. ""I have a high profile within the black community and there is a real issue with black and Asian people getting the vaccines, so I thought that there needs to be a counter to the anti-vax brigade,"" he told the BBC. Mr Emmanuel-Jones decided to use a boosted post, which is the simplest way to advertise on Facebook. Such posts differ from Facebook adverts because they are not created in its advertising management tool Ads Manager, and do not have all the same customisation features. To boost a post, a person has to decide three things: The resulting post, which is labelled as an advert when displayed in the news feed, must be approved by Facebook before it can run. Mr Emmanuel-Jones posted his vaccination picture on The Black Farmer Facebook business page with the caption: ""Just had my first vaccine everyone! The organisation is amazing. This is the #NHS at its best!"" He included the hashtags #theblackfarmer #stayhome #protecttheNHS #savelives But the advert was not approved and he received a message of explanation, which said adverts ""must not contain shocking, sensational, inflammatory or excessively violent content"". However, his post was accepted on Instagram. Previously, Mr Emmanuel-Jones had created a similar post about Black History Month without any issues, as well as running more traditional ads for his business. One advert showing raw sausages in a pan was rejected, which he thinks may have been misinterpreted by Facebook's systems. He revealed the problems with his vaccination advert on the BBC's Question Time, where he was appearing as a guest. Mr Emmanuel-Jones said the process had been frustrating. ""However Facebook is sorting out content, it is making some fundamental mistakes,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Newcastle cancer patients helped on road to recovery,"Daft as a Brush Cancer Patient Care was set up last year by former millionaire-turned-philanthropist Brian Burnie from Newcastle. Now the first volunteer driven vehicle to be provided by the charity has made its debut trip. It is now looking for volunteers to increase its services in the region. Brian Burnie sold his Doxford Park Hotel and Estate last year in a multimillion-pound deal. 'Immense' reward He invested all of the proceeds into the charity to provide a fleet of taxis for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The organisation is now hoping to create enough vehicles capable of transporting 50,000 cancer patients per year. Mr Burnie, said: ""We need lots and lots of volunteers. We're hoping to have a fleet of 25 vehicles over the next nine months so we're needing lots and lots of drivers. ""They're not really drivers, we've called them chauffeurs because they're moving VIP', very important patients. ""Daft as a Brush is going to be a thousand times bigger than Doxford Hall. I only wish I'd done it 40 years earlier. The reward that I get and all the other volunteers get is immense."" The first mode of transport to be put into use is called Starlight and is a seven-seat people carrier decorated with the Daft as a Brush characters. 'A big difference' The first patient to use Daft as a Brush's services was Eddie Carson from Winlaton, Newcastle. Last year Mr Carson had a mastectomy to remove a cancerous growth after he was diagnosed with breast cancer. He needed radiotherapy and was helped to and from his home for treatment by the charity. He said: ""Because of the mastectomy I was banned from driving for months, it was too much pressure to put on the arm so driving was out of the question. ""I was approached by somebody at the hospital and asked if I would be happy to be transported by a brightly coloured vehicle. It makes a big difference."" Mr Carson now wants to become a volunteer to help others. For more information on becoming a volunteer, visit the Daft as a Brush Cancer Patient Care website.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Redcar SSI: Two men killed in explosion near gas pipes at former steelworks site,"Fire crews were called to the old coke ovens at the SSI site in South Bank, Middlesbrough, on Thursday afternoon. It is believed the men were inside a cherry picker at a height, working on pipes near a gas holder when the explosion happened. The site was evacuated and police widened a 250m (820ft) cordon after flames were seen coming from the blast area. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: ""We will examine every single detail of the work that was being conducted. We will make sure we do everything to understand exactly what happened. ""It is impossible to imagine the pain and distress which this news will have brought the loved ones of those involved."" On Friday afternoon four firefighters remained at the scene ""on protective standby"", Cleveland Fire Brigade area manager Steve Johnson said. Dave Cocks, who used to work on the SSI site, said: ""It would appear that this terrible accident has happened in part of that gas-cleaning process. ""Clearing a site of this nature does take a lot of planning and preparation and there's no doubt over the last four years there will be areas off the plant where there would be materials that would need to be removed to keep the plant safe for demolition. ""The clearing of any industrial site does present certain risks and hazards that have to be eliminated wherever possible. ""Closing down an iron-making site of this size is very rarely done in the UK so the planning could take months or indeed years, and it could be years and years before we see the site cleared."" Cleveland Police has declared it a major incident. Det Supt Tariq Ali said: ""The families of those two men have been informed and our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time."" The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and all work on the site has been suspended. The South Bank coke ovens were part of the SSI complex, which had offices and a blast furnace in nearby Redcar. The steelworks announced its closure in 2015 when its Thai-based owners went into liquidation and 2,200 workers lost their jobs. In January, a deal was agreed to transfer more than half of the developable land at the former Redcar Steelworks to the South Tees Development Corporation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Da Vinci's art is star of Swansea's revamped Glynn Vivian gallery,"By Neil PriorBBC News The gallery closed its doors for a £6m refurbishment in 2011, shortly after celebrating its centenary. But the estimated three-year project was delayed by two years after the original contractors tasked with the renovations, Opco Construction, went into administration in 2013. The gallery's Grade II-listed status and difficulties working on a busy city centre site also caused further delays. However, councillor Robert Francis-Davies, Swansea council's cabinet member for enterprise, development and regeneration, believes the improvements have been well worth the wait. ""Having overcome these issues, the people of Swansea and visitors to the city have a lot to look forward to when the gallery reopens to the public this autumn,"" he said. ""Staff are busy working on a top quality exhibition, educational and workshop programme that will benefit many hundreds of thousands of people, and will also soon start an extensive programme of returning and unpacking our vast collection and preparing the exhibition, public and learning areas for re-opening."" Funded by the Arts Council of Wales, the Welsh Government, the Heritage Lottery Fund, conservation body Cadw, and Swansea council, the project includes a new lecture theatre, library, exhibition spaces and larger hold for the storage and conservation of delicate artwork. An extension links the 1970s and 1911 sections of the gallery, with a new entrance making the building fully wheelchair accessible for the first time. And first to be exhibited there will be 10 priceless Leonardo da Vinci drawings from the late 15th and early 16th centuries, loaned by the Royal Collection. The Italian, although a trained painter and best known for works including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, also expanded his activities into sculpture, architecture, engineering, botany, geology, zoology, mapmaking, hydraulics, optics and anatomy, and his principal tool of investigation was drawing. The drawings were originally bound in a single album, which was probably acquired in the 17th Century by King Charles II. Mr Francis-Davies said: ""These drawings from one of the greatest artists and intellectual minds the world has ever known will be of interest to both national and international audiences, so they're an ideal way to kick-start our plans to cement the gallery's reputation for cultural excellence."" The Edwardian Baroque gallery was built to house the art collection of Richard Glynn Vivian, after the son of industrialist John Henry Vivian gifted it to the city. As well as paintings by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Kyffin Williams, it boasts an international collection of porcelain and Swansea china. The Da Vinci drawings will be on display from 15 October.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly numbers boost,"The annual UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme found that the populations of 40 out of 57 species declined in 2016. But the small pearl-bordered fritillary thrived. The butterfly, which is commonly found in Scotland and Wales, saw its numbers more than double. Experts believe it benefitted from a warm start to the summer. Volunteers taking part in the monitoring scheme recorded a 109% increase in its numbers in Scotland between 2015 and 2016. Prof Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, said the small pearl-bordered fritillary usually flies in June and July in Scotland. He added: ""Over that period the weather wasn't too bad, it was warmer than average and a bit sunnier - good conditions for them to emerge and fly and get through the season."" Prof Brereton also pointed to the success of the northern brown argus, which saw a population increase of 38% in Scotland. That butterfly is also active in June and July. They were two of few success stories uncovered by the scientists however, who blamed the mild winter and cool spring for an overall decline in butterfly numbers. Mild winters can lead to increased disease, predation or disruption of overwintering behaviour, while cold springs can lead to shortened life spans. In Scotland, they found that the number of Grayling butterflies had dropped by 61% on the previous year. They also recorded a long-term decline in the abundance of large white butterflies - their numbers have fallen by 75% over the last decade. And the pearl-bordered fritillary - which emerges a couple of months earlier than the small pearl-bordered fritillary - saw its population tumble by 54%. Across the UK, scientists said butterflies suffered their fourth worst year on record last year. Prof Brereton, said: ""Worryingly, not even the pleasant summer weather of 2016 was enough to help butterflies bounce back from a run of poor years. ""The results show that butterflies are failing to cope with our changing climate and how we manage the environment. As butterflies are regarded as good indicators of environmental health this is hugely concerning for both wildlife and people."" The monitoring scheme is led by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It involves thousands of volunteers collecting data throughout the summer at more than 2,000 sites across the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham commented: ""Bad weather and a poor start to the year made 2016 a tough 12 months for Scotland's butterfly population. These difficulties can be clearly seen across the UK with some species reporting a decline to their lowest levels."" She said butterfly numbers were indicators of a healthy environment - and land managers could apply for funding to support butterflies through the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme (AECS). ""We also expect Scotland to participate in the three year UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme which will increase the monitoring and our understanding of butterflies,"" she added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent social services merger rejected,"Caerphilly council said pooling budgets posed a ""significant risk"" as it could be considered to be subsidising its neighbour's services. The Welsh government has previously encouraged authorities to work collaboratively to improve services. Blaenau Gwent council's cabinet will consider its position on Wednesday. A group of council officials have been looking since 2011 at the feasibility of merging the departments to try to improve services and save money. The report presented to cabinet members showed that in 2011/12, Blaenau Gwent reported an overspend on social services by £1,137,751 which is 3.22% of the total budget. In contrast, Caerphilly reported an overspend of £164,847 last year - 0.23% of the total - but in 2010/11 had a surplus of £994,287. Business case Keith Reynolds, Caerphilly cabinet member for corporate services, described the decision to reject a merger as ""the only sensible way forward"". He added: ""It was always going to be predicated on the business case for merging. ""In local government there are too many uncertainties ahead of us, including a comprehensive spending review by the UK government and the effect that could have on the Welsh assembly. ""Collaborative management should only take place where there is a robust business case."" Referring to the council report, Caerphilly's head of corporate finance Nicole Scammell said: ""One issue with the pooling of budgets is whether one authority could be seen to be subsiding another. ""Blaenau Gwent's social services budget situation is worsening. The two authorities financial situations have moved apart in the last two or three years. A fully integrated merger would be a significant risk."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Whilst we believe in good quality and effective local democratic representation, not all services should be replicated 22 times. ""This would not make good financial or organisational sense in the current economic conditions."" The spokesperson said it has supported collaboration with a ""generous financial settlement"" and has repeatedly urged councils to make the most of this and to use the time and money to invest for the future. ""While there has been some progress, more work needs to be done. ""We have recently announced £4.6m from the regional collaboration fund to help public services work together.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Egypt explosion: Tourists on bus injured near Giza pyramids,"South African tourists are among the injured. Most of those hurt suffered minor injuries, while three were treated in hospital, officials say. A device went off close to the museum fence as the bus was passing. It is not yet known who was behind the bombing but Islamist militants have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. In December, three Vietnamese tourists and a local tour guide were killed after a roadside bomb hit their bus. What do we know about the blast? A witness, Mohamed el-Mandouh, told Reuters news agency he had heard a ""very loud explosion"" while sitting in traffic near the site of the blast, which is close to the capital Cairo. The blast hit the bus which was carrying 28 passengers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Rania A Al Mashat said. Images taken after police cordoned the bus show a vehicle with windows blown out or shattered, and glass littering the aisle inside. A private car was also damaged behind the bus. According to state-run broadcaster Nile News TV, the bus was carrying 25 South African tourists and a security source confirmed for Reuters that South Africans had been aboard. Seven South African tourists and 10 Egyptian civilians were injured, Nile News TV says. The tourism minister said all of the people affected by the blast were being ""fully supported in their onward travels"". Critical time for tourism industry By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Cairo Egyptian officials hurried to confirm everything is under control. No life-threatening injuries, all the wounded in a stable condition, and no damage caused to the strategic tourist site. They wanted to send a clear message of assurance. But it's the second explosion in nearly six months near Egypt's most important landmark, the Great Pyramids, and once again questions are raised about how adequate security measures are in such a strategic location. The blast took place a few hundred metres away from the Grand Egyptian Museum, due to open next year. Officials confirm no damage was caused to the museum, expected to house the country's top antiquities. The timing of the explosion is quite critical. Egypt is getting ready to host the African Cup of Nations for football (Afcon) next month. Furthermore, the tourism industry, a lifeline to the struggling Egyptian economy, recently started to recover. Recent official figures show that growth rates are on the rise and tourists are coming back. This vital sector was hit hard in 2015 when a Russian plane was downed over the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, with 224 people on board killed. So the message behind this recent attack may be discouraging. No tourist comes to Cairo without visiting the Great Pyramids, and perhaps some of them might think twice now before heading to this historic site.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NI 100: BBC News NI marks a milestone in Irish history,"These were the words of King George V on 22 June 1921, when he officially opened Northern Ireland's first parliament at Belfast City Hall. Just over six months earlier, on 23 December 1920, the passage of the Government of Ireland Act at Westminster officially introduced partition in Ireland by legislating for two new home rule parliaments on the island, in Belfast and Dublin. It was this law that pointed the way towards the establishment of a separate jurisdiction - Northern Ireland. At the time, the future of Northern Ireland - born as it was shortly after World War One and in the midst of the Irish War of Independence between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces on the island - was extremely unclear. But, now 100 years on, Northern Ireland will mark its centenary, with events planned to look at its past, present and future. The anniversary is likely to reignite the debate on the partition of Ireland into Northern Ireland and the modern-day Republic of Ireland and how it has shaped life on the island. Likewise, here at BBC News NI, we'll be evaluating how Northern Ireland came to be and how decisions made 100 years ago reverberated across both the UK and the newly-created Irish Free State (later to be the Republic of Ireland). Across our digital output, on BBC Newsline and on BBC Radio Ulster, we'll bring you programmes, items and articles looking at the birth and evolution of Northern Ireland from its beginnings to the present day, as well as developments in London and Dublin. This week - which marks 100 years since the passage of the Government of Ireland Act - sees the beginning of that coverage, with more 100-year anniversaries to come in the coming months - whether that be opening of NI's first parliament, as mentioned above, or the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, which established a 26-country Irish Free State and copper-fastened partition. From today, you'll be able to read about the events that led up to partition, the major players, the simmering sectarian tension that led to trouble in Londonderry and more. Throughout the year our online coverage will be carried under the tag NI 100 and displayed on the news page, so you can all check here for the latest coverage throughout the year. Explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago in the company of Tara Mills and Declan Harvey. Each week a different piece of the story is added. But this is not about 1921, it's about how we got to 2021. You can listen to the latest podcast, and catch-up on previous episodes here.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ancrum Old Bridge rediscovered beneath the River Teviot,"Two years of work have led to the discovery of the ""lost"" medieval bridge in the River Teviot near Ancrum. Experts, using radiocarbon dating, have confirmed it is from the mid-1300s. They said that makes them the oldest scientifically-dated bridge remains found in their original position across one of Scotland's rivers. Historic Environment Scotland (HES) has funded the Ancrum and District Heritage Society's (ADHS) work - in partnership with Dendrochronicle and Wessex Archaeology - which led to the discovery. Built during the reigns of David II of Scotland and Edward III of England, the bridge is said to be of ""historic and strategic national importance"". It crossed the River Teviot, carrying the Via Regia (The King's Way), on its way from Edinburgh to Jedburgh and the border. It is believed James V would have crossed at the spot in 1526, as would Mary Queen of Scots returning from her tour of the Borders in 1566, and the Marquis of Montrose on his way to battle at Philiphaugh in 1645. Kevin Grant, archaeology manager at HES, said it was one of the ""most exciting and significant archaeological discoveries in Scotland in recent years"". ""This project shows that discoveries of immense importance remain to be found by local heritage groups,"" he said. He said it also showed what could be achieved by bringing ""archaeological science and expertise together with local knowledge"". Geoff Parkhouse, from ADHS, said: ""Ancrum Old Bridge now has a 14th Century date. ""In Scotland, there is not a standing bridge that is earlier than the 15th Century. ""In those times, during flood or highwater, the Ancrum Bridge may have been the only place to cross the Teviot between Hawick and Berwick, making it one of the most important structures in medieval Scotland."" Dr Coralie Mills, of Dendrochronicle, a consultancy specialising in tree-ring dating, said the structure showed the ""rare survival of part of an early bridge in a hugely strategic historical location"". ""The oak timbers are in remarkably good condition and provide really important local material for tree-ring analysis in a region where few medieval buildings survived the ravages of war,"" she said. Dr Bob MacKintosh of Wessex Archaeology said the site had been ""challenging to survey"". However, he said the results were ""really exciting"" with the bridge foundations being built using a method never previously found in an archaeological context in Scotland.

Amphibian that buries head in sand named after Donald Trump,"A newly discovered amphibian that buries its head in the sand has been named after him, apparently in response to his comments about climate change. The Dermophis donaldtrumpi, which was discovered in Panama, was named by the head of a company that had bid $25,000 (£19,800) at auction for the privilege. The company said it wanted to raise awareness about climate change. ""[Dermophis donaldtrumpi] is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and is therefore in danger of becoming extinct as a direct result of its namesake's climate policies,"" said EnviroBuild co-founder Aidan Bell in a statement. The small, blind, creature is a type of caecilian that primarily lives underground, and Mr Bell drew an unflattering comparison between its behaviour and Mr Trump's. ""Burrowing [his] head underground helps Donald Trump when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change,"" he wrote. The amphibian is not the first beast to be named after Donald Trump. Last year, Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, was discovered by biologist Vazrick Nazari in a collection of moths from the Museum of Entomology, at the University of California. The scientist said the moth's unique head colouring reminded him of the president. Other presidential animals Barack Obama boasts the title of being the most commemorated of all US presidents in scientific names, with 14 different species named after him. These include a trapdoor spider from California (Aptostichus barackobamai) and a small coral fish from his native state of Hawaii (Tosanoides obama). The fish has a small dot on the dorsal fin which reminded researchers of Mr Obama's presidential campaign logo. George W Bush and his vice-president Dick Cheney have also been honoured as slime mould beetles (Agathidium bushi and Agathidium cheneyi respectively). Researchers Kelly Miller and Quentin Wheeler were quick to express, though, that the animals they were named after had nothing to do with their views of the pair. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced. But Mr Trump, whose administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda, has accused those scientists of having a ""political agenda"" and cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the Earth's rising temperatures. ""I don't know that it's manmade,"" he said in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes in October. ""I'm not denying climate change but [temperatures] could very well go back,"" he added, without offering evidence. Last month, Mr Trump questioned a report by his own government that found climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars annually and damage health. ""I don't believe it,"" he told reporters at the time. After taking office he announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits countries to keeping a limit on rising global temperatures. He justified this decision by asserting that he had been elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris and the deal disadvantaged US businesses and workers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Diabetes burnout': The mental-health impact of diagnosis,"By Claire Kendall and Jeremy CookeBBC News Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 19, Naomi, now 33, says she reached a point where she simply could not handle ""the physical or mental challenges of diabetes any more"", a condition known as ""diabetes burnout"". About 250,000 people in England have type 1 diabetes, which means the body cannot produce insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar levels. It can lead to organ damage, eyesight problems and - in extreme cases - limb amputation. But for many there is also a significant psychological impact of learning to manage the condition. Naomi felt she could no longer bear testing her blood sugar levels many times each day to calculate how much insulin she needed to inject, even though she knew she was risking her long-term health and putting herself in extreme danger, at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can lead to a coma. And she became so ill she was admitted to an eating disorder unit even though she was not struggling to eat. The head of the unit, Dr Carla Figueirdo, says of her diabetes patients: ""These people are seriously unwell, seriously unwell. ""They are putting themselves at harm every day of their lives if they don't take their insulin. ""They could die."" Naomi's consultant at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Dr Helen Partridge, says the psychological impact of a diabetes diagnosis should not be underestimated. ""You've got to learn to live with it day in, day out,"" she says. ""It is not going away, unfortunately. ""And so, actually, the psychological aspect is huge."" 'Improve outcomes' The hospital is hosting one of two NHS England pilot projects looking at how to treat type 1 diabetes patients whose chronic illness affects their mental health. NHS England diabetes lead Prof Partha Kar says: ""The NHS long-term plan commits strongly on getting mental and physical health together. ""If we do tackle these two together, it will help improve outcomes."" Naomi, who has now left the unit, says: ""I am really grateful that I came here, terrifying as it was. ""It saved my life. ""And I am really grateful for the team here."" 'Choose life' The pilot scheme has helped more than 70 people like Naomi, many of whom, the team say, would have gone undiagnosed without it And Naomi herself now feels able to look to the future. ""Even if there is not a cure, there is still hope,"" she says, ""Always hope. And we get to choose life every day. ""So it is an opportunity to choose life.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Reality Check: How are English councils spending your taxes?,"Councils in England receive their money from: Schools, most of policing budgets and public health are funded by separate pots of money from central government. These are administered by councils, but they don't have much discretion over how they spend them. But council tax makes up the biggest chunk of money which councils have some freedom over how they spend. And this, along with business rates - a tax that businesses have to pay on their properties - and a few small grants from central government, has to pay for everything else, from libraries to bin collection to caring for vulnerable children. Councils give their business rates to the Treasury which keeps half and returns the other half to councils in the form of the Revenue Support Grant. They are then free to spend this money as they see fit. They also receive a few other small grants, some of which are paid for by the half of their business rates that the Treasury hangs onto. This week, local government's financial settlement for the year ahead was announced - but to see how the money is actually spent, we have to look at this year's figures. In 2017-18, English councils' core budgets totalled about £44bn - of which about £25bn came from council tax and £17bn from a combination of local business rates and the Revenue Support Grant. Here's how it was spent: The Revenue Support Grant - the money from central government which is not ring-fenced to spent for any specific purpose - has fallen dramatically over the past few years. Eventually it will be phased out altogether. As councils receive less money from central government, they rely more on the money they are able to raise through council taxes - but this varies around the country. Areas with less well off populations have fewer people paying council tax and generally lower tax rates, meaning they are less able to raise money this way. Can councils raise more? In 2015, government announced councils would soon be able to keep 100% of their business rates - something which is currently being piloted. This is welcomed by some who see it as a way of giving councils more freedom and a stronger incentive to grow their local economy. But critics say this would be a regressive move, since poorer areas are both less able to raise money through business rates and often have higher needs, making delivering services to their local populations more expensive. For example, areas with poorer populations will have more elderly people who require council-funded social care. In 2015, many councils were also given the power to levy a 2% council tax precept, ring-fenced to be spent on adult social care, every year for three years without having to go to a vote. The next year this was adjusted so councils could raise tax by an extra 3% for two years, meaning they could bring the extra money in more quickly.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis inquest to explore heading link,"Alan Jarvis played for Everton and Hull City in the 1960s and 1970s, winning three caps for his country. The 76-year-old, who was thought to have dementia, died at a nursing home in Mold, Flintshire, in December. Coroner John Gittins has opened his inquest at Ruthin. He said neuropathology had been undertaken and that Mr Jarvis' death and a possible link to heading a football would be explored further at a full hearing. Mr Jarvis, a midfielder, played for Wales against England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, earning his other caps against Scotland and Northern Ireland. His daughter, Sarah Jarvis, of Northop, Flintshire, said his family had arranged to have his brain donated to researchers at the University of Glasgow after his death. Ms Jarvis said Dr Willie Stewart, who is studying the possible link between heading a football and brain damage, examined it in January and passed his report to the coroner. 'Increase knowledge' She said she believed heading had been to blame for the difficulties her father faced in later life - including the loss of his speech. Ms Jarvis said the family hoped his inquest would increase ""knowledge"" and that, while heading has been banned for children under 12 during training, changes in the adult game might not be necessary. ""My family loves watching football, so it's nothing I would want to change, it's more awareness,"" she said. ""The only thing I want to come out of it, is to look after these players. ""I know they say the football was heavy back then, but now it's lighter and faster, so who's to say there's not still going to be the same amount of people coming through with dementia."" Dr Stewart's research featured in the 2018 BBC documentary Alan Shearer: Dementia, Football and Me. In 2019, a study he led found former professional footballers were three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population. The study began after claims former West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle died because of repeated head trauma. There remains, however, no definitive evidence that heading a ball causes dementia. Football authorities have said more research is needed, with the FA saying it is ""committed to doing all it can"" to help provide greater understanding of the issue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Schools need support not blame from Ofsted, says head","By Judith BurnsEducation reporter, BBC News It had a brand new building with state-of-the-art sports and computing facilities. Since then the proportion of students getting good GCSEs in English and maths has risen from 18% to 57%. But Stephen Ball, principal since 2011, knows there is room for improvement. He knows because he has a 20-year track record of turning round failing schools, and from experience he knows it will take him seven years to build ""an outstanding comprehensive"". He also knows it because Ofsted says so. The school's most recent inspection, in March 2013, was just 15 months after he took over. Rating scrapped Ofsted said the school ""required improvement"". So New Charter Academy is not among the 71% of English secondary schools rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"" by Ofsted. Mr Ball says there was ""an unreasonableness"" about Ofsted demanding excellence so soon after the new team took over. In an earlier inspection, the school was rated ""satisfactory"" - but that rating was scrapped by chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw in 2012 and replaced by ""requires improvement"". The intention was to encourage more schools to push for the higher rating of ""good"". But Mr Ball says constant changes to Ofsted's framework and to exam standards ""drain energy away from the core task which is teaching and learning"". Staff deterred In particular, he says, GCSEs have been made tougher so results have ""plateaued"". ""That's not the fault of the schools - it's a symptom of the way exams have changed."" He says changes to Ofsted's framework have turned it into ""a deficit model which seeks out what schools have failed to achieve rather than identifying what they have actually managed to do in terms of improving standards"". At New Charter Academy, 54% of students are eligible for the government's pupil premium payments, which support the education of disadvantaged youngsters. Mr Ball says Ofsted should do more to offer improving schools like his in deprived areas ""a climate of support"". This, he argues, would do more to improve teaching and learning than ""constant blame"", which he says can only deter staff from wanting to work in challenging areas and add to teacher shortages.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Estate agents urged to tell buyers about air pollution,"The industry trade body said providing this information should now be standard practice. ""Air quality is now public information, and it will never not be again,"" said Mark Hayward, chief executive of NAEA Propertymark. His comments came as a new website was launched which details air pollution by postcode. The site, called addresspollution.org, uses data from King's College London to give the level of nitrogen dioxide. House price hit? The website has been created by the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI), a not-for-profit campaign, the Times newspaper reports. The site is currently limited to properties in London. It shows the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the air and compares it to the World Health Organization's annual legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. Long term exposure to high concentrations of the gas have been linked to early deaths. Humphrey Milles, its founder, said he thinks it could have an impact on where new homes are built, and that data such as this should be used to determine where schools and homes for the elderly are built. ""The data shows this is isn't just something that you are exposed to on the road, this pollution is in the air in our homes,"" he said. Mr Hayward conceded that the move would be extra work for agencies and would come on top of a slew of extra information sellers must provide, such as energy efficiency data. ""It may not be popular because it's an additional piece of information,"" he told the BBC, especially at a time when the number of sales have fallen, hitting agencies' revenues. But he said agents may as well start now before they are forced to by law. He also said that, like energy efficiency information, it may be ignored by some buyers who are led more by their gut than data. ""No-one says I won't buy that house with the roses around the door because of a poor energy rating."" But more and more people are interested in air quality when it comes to choosing where to live, said Henry Pryor, a buying agent of 33 years. He says he has included pollution data in his reports for clients for the last five years. Electric car improvement People interested in air quality probably won't ask for discounts, but instead shun a particular area, which may depress prices, he said. ""It's not going to be a negotiating tool, it's going to be an informative tool."" Air quality may improve as more vehicles become electric. The number of electric car models available to consumers in Europe is expected to triple by 2021, the European Federation for Transport and Environment said in July. This shift could help areas with high pollution, said Mr Pryor. His clients in London often look to the city's congestion charge zone for cleaner air, he said, as well as homes near the city's parks. ""More and more people are interested in what they are breathing,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
John Boyega says father was stopped by police on way from church,"The Star Wars actor, who was a prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter protests in London this summer, plays a police officer in Sir Steve McQueen's new film series, Small Axe. His real-life character, Leroy Logan, was also an anti-racism reformer. Boyega stressed that black Britons had experienced the ""darkest scenarios"". ""I've been stopped and searched,"" the Londoner told the Radio Times. ""And my dad, who was a Pentecostal minister, got stopped on the way back from church. I was little. ""Everybody knows, especially if you grew up in Peckham, somebody who's gone through the darkest scenarios with the police,"" he added. ""I do. I know a few people."" His Small Axe film, entitled Red, White and Blue, follows Leroy as he attempts to reform the police force from within after seeing his own father assaulted by two officers. Leroy was appointed an MBE in 2001 for his contribution to policing, and retired in 2013 after 30 years of service. In June, stars of the movie world, including JK Rowling and Jordan Peele, praised Boyega for his emotional megaphone speech in the capital - following the death of George Floyd while in US police custody. Despite their support, he said he still fears his activism could negatively impact his career, but that it was a risk worth taking. ""You know that moment is going to go global and if I don't get cast because people or casting directors feel like it's too much friction for what they're trying to do. It is what it is,"" said Boyega. 'Fuming and angry' Working with Sir Steve on the new anthology series - inspired by the stories of black British culture - had been like undergoing ""therapy"", Boyega added. One of the most powerful scenes takes place in a police changing room, where Leroy finds racist graffiti on his locker. ""I don't remember filming that scene,"" said Boyega, of the intense on-set experience. ""I just remember fuming and being angry. ""I didn't see the locker room or the locker door until those cameras were rolling. So that reaction was all natural to the character and the choices I thought he would make."" The first Small Axe film, Mangrove - which premieres on BBC One on Sunday - stars Letitia Wright, who appeared in the 2018 superhero film Black Panther. It focuses on the trial of the Mangrove Nine; a group of black activists accused of inciting a riot at a protest 50 years ago. Wright told the Radio Times it was important that black British people were having their stories told on screen. ""So much gets lost within our black British history and it's important that a beautiful light is shone on these stories,"" she said.

Covid-19: Fewest firms planning job cuts since pandemic began,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News A total of 32,000 redundancies were proposed, up 9% on last January, despite new lockdown rules closing businesses across most of the UK. The figures suggest that the decision to extend the furlough scheme has helped to prevent wider job losses. The numbers were released by the Insolvency Service in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. Employers planning 20 or more redundancies are obliged to notify the Insolvency Service at the start of the process by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. This gives an early indication of the state of the labour market ahead of the redundancy statistics published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which can be several months behind. The numbers for January showed that, in total, 32,000 jobs were described as at risk in those plans. It is the lowest figure since the start of the pandemic, excluding December, which usually sees less activity because of the Christmas holidays. This was despite lockdowns across almost all of the UK, which closed schools and many businesses including restaurants, bars and retailers deemed ""non-essential"". ""This seems to suggest that the extension of the furlough scheme from 31 October to 30 April has been effective in preventing another surge in job losses,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. The lockdown last spring led to the largest increase in redundancies on record, with about 150,000 jobs at risk of redundancy in June and July. The latest data from the ONS showed a record 395,000 redundancies in the period from September to November. But these figures appear with a time lag, as they are based on a survey asking people if they have been made redundant in the previous three months - so some of those jobs will have been lost as far back as July. ONS weekly estimates suggest redundancies peaked in September, and have since started to come down. As Insolvency Service figures only cover firms making 20 or more job cuts, the total number of redundancies made is usually larger. However, individual employers often make fewer jobs redundant than the number they initially notify. Firms in Northern Ireland notify the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and are not included in the Insolvency Service figures.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Criggion museum bid for ex-WW2 and Cold War centre,"The Criggion radio station near Welshpool shut a decade ago and BT's site lease ended on Wednesday. The station's owner, Telereal Trillium, has decided to sell the property in four lots. Four bidders have been shortlisted by the company. It said the sale of the four lots should be completed by the end of June. Shrewsbury-based estate agents Balfour, which is handling the sale for Telereal, said each of the four bidders had put in offers for one separate lot each. 'Visitor attraction' County councillor Graham Brown, who is a member of a group that wants to develop part of the site into a museum to commemorate the communication centre's role in World War Two and the Cold War, said: ""The Criggion station has been left to rot since it was decommissioned 11 years ago. ""We developed an idea to create a community interest company to develop the buildings into a visitor attraction, museum, and education centre to preserve this historical site and regenerate the area's economy."" For 60 years the Criggion station and its three 700ft (210m) radio masts and three 600ft (180m) towers were a part of the scenery near Welshpool on the Powys/Shropshire border. Built in 1942 it was used during WW2 to keep the Admiralty in contact with Royal Navy ships around the world. When the war ended the site became a signal relay station for nuclear submarines during the Cold War, as well as for overseas telephone communications. The Omega project developed at Criggion in the late 1950s was a forerunner of the GPS system. The station closed in 2003 and the masts were demolished, but the 10 or so buildings were leased from Telereal Trillium by BT. Mr Brown said: ""Structurally, the buildings are sound as they are bombproof but the investment needed for a visitor attraction would be immense."" Museum bid A Telereal Trillium spokesman said: ""Following marketing of the site all interested parties were asked to submit bids by 11 April 2014. ""Over 10 submissions of interest were received including a number of bids from members of the local community. ""Four bidders have been shortlisted and the sales should be completed by the end of June 2014. ""The shortlisted bidders have a variety of plans for the site, with one party intending to create a museum. ""This process will allow it to be brought back into use so that it can once again make a contribution to the local community.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Guernsey sets reclaiming support threshold at £50k,"The reintroduced payroll co-funding scheme includes a new clause allowing the States of Guernsey to recoup Covid support at the end of the year. However, after criticism from businesses the States recognised profit up to this limit as ""personal income"". Coronavirus cases rose to 142 by Friday, six days after the bailiwick declared full a lockdown. The co-funding scheme pays 80% of Guernsey's £8.70 minimum wage to employees up to 42 hours a week, with businesses obliged to pay the remaining 20%. It is anticipated it will cost the States £2.5m per week and will open for claims on 1 February. 'Listened to concerns' The clarification to the scheme was made to account for business owners who do not pay themselves a regular salary, the States explained. Any support recovered will follow the submission of a 2021 tax return, meaning repayment would not be requested until 2022 at the earliest. Flexible payment arrangements will be available to spread any cost incurred, the States said. Profit will be calculated as a business' trading income, also known as turnover, minus business expenses like the cost of goods sold, wages, rent and utilities. However, businesses cannot claim a deduction for capital expenditure, like the purchase of a new car or computer. When a majority shareholder of a company is also employed by the business, their salary will be added back to the profit and support will only be reclaimed if the total exceeds the £50,000 limit. The recovery does not apply to charities or not-for-profit organisations, or any payments of financial support in 2020, the States said. Deputy Mark Helyar, who is leading on treasury matters for the Policy and Resources Committee, said the decision was made after the committee ""listened to the concerns that businesses have shared"". He said: ""We want businesses to prosper and the support recovery clause is about providing support where it is genuinely needed. ""With public finances under significant pressure, no-one in the community would want financial support to be handed out where it is not needed."" Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Microbreweries 'the way forward' after 11 open in year,"Figures from the real ale lobby group show 11 breweries opened in Wales over 12 months, with six of them in pubs. Wales spokesman Ian Saunders said: ""The interest in real ale is there and people are also very mindful of purchasing local products."" Last year a report showed 375 pubs closed in Wales from 2007-10. Launching the 40th edition of its Good Beer Guide, Camra revealed that Wales now boasts 52 breweries, helping to push the UK total to 1,009, the highest number for 70 years. Wales regional director Mr Saunders said the increase in people's loyalty to locally produced products such as food was starting to spill over in to what they drink, bringing an opportunity for small, local, brewers. He said: ""It is a growing trend. I'm hoping that its the way forward. Although alcohol sales in pubs are declining, the real ale percentage of that is on the increase. ""When I first moved to Wales, there were very local breweries and a lot of people I knew drank no real ale at all. ""Since local breweries have started, people have stayed loyal to them, because they are Welsh. ""Because of the interest in them, that has encouraged a few people to start their own microbreweries. ""Some free houses have decided to do their own beer. That's even more local."" Pubs sold off by pub chains against a background of continued closures offered opportunities for entrepreneurial landlords keen to offer a range of beers different from those of the big breweries, he said. He said: ""If that is bought by a private individual, they are free to do what they want."" However, lone microbreweries were unlikely to have the money to set themselves up in a pub from the outset, he said. He praised four rival breweries in north Wales who have joined forces to help reopen a pub dating back to the 1920s in Conwy. The Albion, which opened in January, is the idea of London-based Welsh businessman Arthur Ellis who bought the building last year and invited four microbreweries to sell their beers alongside each other. The new guide also features the campaign's UK pub of the year, the Bridge End Inn at Ruabon near Wrexham. The small community pub, which reopened three years ago, became the first Welsh winner of the award. In July last year, figures released by the Save Our Pubs and Clubs campaign, a coalition of groups that want the smoking ban to be amended, claimed 80 of the 375 pub closures in Wales from 2007-2010 were in the north.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bovis says it will fix home faults by end of 2017,"In its half-year results statement, the firm said it had identified the issues and they were ""all very fixable"". Some Bovis customers had complained about homes being sold unfinished, and had reported plumbing and electrical faults in new properties. The firm, which has already set aside more than £10m for the problem, saw profits fall 31% to £42.7m. It said this was due to several issues, including fixing the faulty homes, as well as the costs of defending itself from two takeover bids this year. Case study: Pritesh Patel, Bovis home owner: ""I moved into Whitehouse Park, Milton Keynes, last November. It is a large development with more than 4,000 houses planned. ""All the ones built in my phase have defective brick work, something that is hard to correct once it has been done. The damp-proof course in several houses, including mine, is missing, something that should have been obvious. There are so many faults. ""The floor joists are of a minimum specification and so further apart, so the floor boards are like a trampoline. ""Some of my neighbours have had faults fixed, but they have had to move out for this to be done, some for up to six months. I have been promised remedial action but it hasn't happened, even though I have been in touch with Bovis daily. ""There is no programme of work, so the people who shout the loudest have the quickest results."" The company said in a statement: ""We apologise to any customer who feels that they have not received the high standards in quality and service they deserve, but we are committed to resolving any outstanding issues for all of our buyers as soon as possible."" It added it had made ""significant"" changes to how it operates, and that a growing majority of our customers would now recommend us to family and friends"". Earlier this year, Bovis was a takeover target for two rivals - Galliford Try and Redrow. However, Bovis rejected both of their bids and eventually the two suitors abandoned their takeover attempts. Announcing its results, Bovis said it was ""strongly cash generative"" and would be returning £180m to shareholders through special dividends over the next three years. The average selling price of its homes rose 9% to £277,400. Bovis is aiming to complete about 4,000 properties a year, which is down from a previous target of between 5,000 and 6,000 completions.

Boston Tapes: Ex-IRA man loses fight over secret tapes,"Anthony McIntyre is among a number of ex-paramilitaries who gave confidential testimonies to Boston College about their role during the Troubles. The convicted murderer was also a lead researcher on the oral history project, known as the Boston tapes. The High Court has given him two weeks to apply to appeal the verdict. It means the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is not yet be able to examine recordings which have already been transported from the United States to Belfast. Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said: ""We will direct that the material should be held in secure storage, under seal, at the Royal Courts of Justice."" Anthony McIntyre was one of the main researchers in the Boston College project to compile an oral history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Originally from Belfast, he was jailed for murder in 1977. Boston College's Belfast project secured candid interviews with both loyalist and republican paramilitaries, who spoke about their personal involvement in Troubles-era violence. The interviews were arranged under the condition that the material would not be made public until the death of the individual interviewee. 'Mistakes' The recordings were held in a library at Boston College but in 2011, the PSNI began a legal bid to gain access to the tapes. The officers have already secured transcripts and tapes of interviews given by former IRA woman Dolours Price and high-profile loyalist Winston ""Winkie"" Rea. The British government then served Boston College with a subpoena seeking copies of Mr McIntyre interviews, but he tried to stop the process by seeking a judicial review. Mr McIntyre lawyers claimed police and prosecutors should not be allowed to access the tapes due to mistakes in an International Letter of Request (ILOR) which set out a list of alleged offences which officers are investigating. The ILOR list included a bomb explosion at Rugby Avenue in Belfast in 1976, but Mr McIntyre's legal team insisted that he was a victim in the bombing. 'Subterfuge' They also argued the ILOR was littered with other inaccuracies, including an armed robbery for which their client was never convicted and IRA membership charge of which he was acquitted. The Public Prosecution Service's legal team told the court that mistaken information in the original correspondence had been corrected and regularised. A PPS lawyer also rejected any suggestion the Rugby Avenue explosion was being used as an act of ""subterfuge"" to gain access to Mr McIntyre's Boston College tapes. A panel of judges at Belfast High Court ruled that any flaws in the ILOR process were not due to bad faith on the part of the authorities. They dismissed Mr McIntyre's application but said he would have two weeks to confirm his intention to appeal the verdict.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google faces French court claim over market dominance,"It claims that Google used its market dominance to block the development of rival services. An earlier complaint from 1PlusV and others, including Microsoft, triggered a European Commission investigation. It also faces a probe from the US Federal Trade Commission. Lost profits 1plusV, which runs the Ejustice.fr legal website and search engine, said that court action was the ""logical"" next step in its campaign to force closer scrutiny of Google's practices. ""Our actions benefit not just one company, but all players in the booming vertical search business,"" said 1plusV founder Bruno Guillard. It filed its initial complaint with the EC in February 2010 and a formal investigation was launched in November. Google was served notice of the claim on Monday. ""We have only just received the complaint so we can't comment in detail yet. We always try to do what's best for our users. It's the key principle that drives our company and we look forward to explaining this,"" the firm said in a brief statement. At the core of 1plusV's case is the claim that it lost revenue because Google prevented it from developing specialised ""vertical"" search engines. Black-listed ""Google employed a number of anti-competitive practices and unethical behaviour over a period of four years to cripple 1plusV's ability to generate business and advertising,"" it said in a press release.

It also accused Google of artificially pushing its services to the first page of search results.

In order to take advantage of Adsense, 1plusV said it was forced to abandon its own search technology and adopt Google's. Google's advertising revenues hit $8.3bn in the first quarter of 2011.

Brexit law 'constitutionally insensitive' to Welsh Government,"Their report criticises part of Brexit legislation that holds back to Westminster powers in devolved areas that are currently held at EU level. It has been dubbed a ""power-grab"" by Scottish and Welsh ministers. Ministers at Westminster say the devolved administrations will ultimately get more powers. But they say the functions should initially be held at Westminster to allow UK-wide frameworks in areas like farming to be developed. The report, from the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, says the ""main source of disquiet and disagreement"" between the UK and devolved governments ""derives from the lack of communication and established mechanisms for both proper consultation and shared decision making between governments"". MPs are due to vote on proposed changes to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill next Monday. 'Essential' Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ""At this moment, it is both essential and an opportunity to establish an effective system of intergovernmental relations which has always been missing from the UK's constitutional arrangements."" Referring to the part of the bill that covers powers in devolved areas, Mr Jenkin added: ""The dispute around Clause 11 is a perfect example of why this is needed. In the last Parliament, we recommended several achievable first steps toward such arrangements, which would be been extremely helpful right now. ""A system of mutual trust and effective communication and consultation is essential for the internal governance of the UK, now more than ever as we approach our departure from the European Union."" Analysis by James Williams, BBC Wales Brexit correspondent It is the detail not the principle of the proposed law that the Welsh Government objects to - as the first minister told AMs on Monday, ""we agree with the UK government that certainty is important"". In all, officials in Whitehall have identified 64 powers in areas under Welsh control that will return from the EU post-Brexit. First Minister Carwyn Jones thinks ""a responsible and mature"" way of dealing with those powers would be to allow them to flow straight back to Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh and London on the agreement that the respective governments leave them unchanged ""until such time as we are agreed that things should change"". As the EU Withdrawal Bill is currently drafted, those powers will all gather in Westminster, hence the first minister's talk of a ""power grab"" even though the Wales Office says they will eventually make their way to Cardiff. In private, Welsh ministers and officials are pleased with the ""warm words"" they've heard from the UK Government in recent months. But, unless a change in tone leads to a change on the face of the bill, the Welsh Government will remain opposed to the proposed law.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK film age rating rules get stricter for scenes of sexual violence,"The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) surveyed more than 10,000 people and found it to be among parents' main concerns. Any film showing sexual violence will now get at least a 15 rating rather than a 12 or a 12A. The BBFC also wants its ratings to appear on all streaming services. BBFC chief executive David Austin said a film like Keira Knightley's 2008 drama The Duchess, which was classed as a 12 at the time, would be made a 15 today because it included a rape scene. ""What parents told us was, that's too much for 12-year-olds,"" he told BBC News. ""It's enough that a 12-year-old knows that a rape has taken place. They do not need to see it, no matter how discreetly it's filmed."" In the survey, parents said they were worried about the ""sexualisation of society and what they called the pornification of society"", according to Mr Austin. ""They are worried about children growing up being exposed to too much too soon, and they want to hold onto their children's childhood as far as they can,"" he said. ""That's another one of the reasons why from now on we will not be classifying any depiction of sexual violence at 12. We will limit it to 15."" The BBFC also looked at other ""real life"" scenarios like self-harm, mental health and suicide, but said its existing rules were in line with the public's views. For example, viewers were happy that Netflix's To The Bone, about a young women dealing with anorexia, was given a 15. ""Parents and children said we were right to do this because that issue is not suitable when it's shown in that way for 12-year-olds,"" Mr Austin said. Viewers were less worried about less realistic action violence, such as that seen in James Bond or Marvel films, the survey found. Meanwhile, 95% of teenagers surveyed said they want online streaming services to carry the same age ratings as cinemas and DVDs. They already appear on many Netflix shows and films, but Mr Austin said they were working with Netflix to make it 100% - as well as working with other services. He said: ""We are going to be working in 2019 with some of the big platforms to fulfil what the public has asked us to do, which is to ensure those ratings are consistent when you view something at the cinema, whether you view it on DVD or whether you view it on a tablet in your bedroom."" The new guidelines will come into effect on 28 February. Films that would have a different rating Source: BBFC. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Tigers ‘ready for joint mechanism’,"“We agreed with Norwegian proposals for the mechanism before our departure,” head of LTTE’s peace secretariat S Pulithevan speaking from Geneva told BBC Sandeshaya (BBC Sinhala). He said 'now it was time for the governmet to respond positively'. Norwegian special envoy Erik Solheim told BBC Sandeshaya on Sunday that an agreement on the joint mechanism between Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers is expected to be set in motion within weeks. After a visit to a Muslim refugee camp in Puttalam, Solheim said that Muslims will also be included in the proposed mechanism. Norwegian visit Norwegian envoy on Monday met head of Sri Lanka government's secretariat for coordinating the peace process (SCOPP) Jayantha Dhanapala in Colombo. Dhanapala raised concern on the recent murders of two government officials in the east, Sharmini Serasinghe, press secretary for SCOPP told BBC Sandeshaya. The LTTE however, raises concerns of the difficulties that will be encountered in the implementation of the mechanism. “We have to see how the Norwegians are going to bring the parties of diverging views within the government to agree on the mechanism as the need of the hour,” Pulithevan said. Government’s coalition partner Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has strongly opposed a joint mechanism for tsunami reconstruction saying it would lead to the separation of the country. “There is no need for a joint mechanism. Tsunami relief work can be done through the Sri Lankan state machinery,” JVP's parliamentary group leader Wimal Weerawansa told a rally held in Maharagama. Structure Speaking with BBC Sandeshaya from Geneva LTTE’s political wing leader SP Thamilselvan said the LTTE itself suggested the inclusion of the Muslim members for the joint mechanism. The suggested Apex body would include one member from each community. According to Norwegian proposals the regional bodies to have ten members; five Tamils, three Muslims and two Sinhalas. District joint bodies will consist of District Secretary (DS), representatives from LTTE, Muslim community, Civil society and the UN organisations. World Bank is to be the custodian of the funds allocated for joint tsunami mechanism. The LTTE delegation, leaving for Colombo on Tuesday, is to meet Erik Solheim on Wednesday in Colombo. This is the first time the Norwegian facilitators meeting the Wanni leaders in government-controlled area.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Great British Bake Off: Andrew Smyth's parents speak of pride,"On Wednesday night viewers saw the 25-year-old secure a place in the final of popular program. Andrew is now the ""last man standing"" in the competition after Selasi Gbormittah left the famous tent. He was crowned star-baker in the patisserie-themed semi-final. Nigel Smyth and wife, Kay, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that they credit Andrew's success in the competition with his ""keep calm and carry on"" attitude in the face of pressure. Mrs Smyth said: ""He's the same person on television that we see at home. ""I don't think it's worth your while in Northern Ireland getting airs and graces, it's not the way people are here"". Mr Smyth said: ""I think we're all taking a bit of credit, we certainly gave him a lot of encouragement as a family. ""But he's been away from home now for seven years, so a lot of the credit has to go to himself. It goes down to a lot of determination and creativity."" Andrew, 25, is a Cambridge University graduate and now works as an aerospace engineer in Derby. While baking may be an unlikely hobby for an engineer, Nigel Smyth insists his son's career is an asset. ""He uses his organisational skills in his baking. Last night, his fondants at the end were precision. ""He just enjoys it. He is baking two or three times a week at the moment. ""The problem is there is a high expectation and everyone expects him to bring a bake to every event."" Tight-lipped on the final But Andrew's parents remain tight-lipped on which of the three finalists have won - it will be screened next week. Mrs Smyth said: ""It's been very exciting, but it was filmed quite a while ago. ""We had more tension in the weeks Andrew was actually doing it and ringing us every week. ""We wouldn't want to spoil the excitement for anyone else. ""Everyone in Northern Ireland has been so supportive, every where we go people comment on it and say how much they've been enjoying GBBO.

Brexit: Pound and shares jump on optimism over talks,"Shares in banks and housebuilders also soared as optimism about a breakthrough buoyed companies with a UK focus. It was hoped that a preliminary deal might be reached on Tuesday, ready to go before a summit on Thursday. Sterling rose 1.5% on the dollar to $1.28, and by a similar amount against the euro to 86.3 pence. On the FTSE 100, shares with a big exposure to the health of the UK economy rose sharply. Builders Barratt Developments and British Land were up about 6%, and Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland rose more than 5%. Next, ITV and Ocado were also big risers. ""A deal between the UK and EU was 60% in the price [of sterling] and now we stand to see if the remaining 40% come into play,"" said Stephen Gallo, European head of foreign exchange at BMO. Morten Lund, a senior forex strategist at Nordea, added: ""The reaction from the markets shows they want to get this deal over and they are ready to push the button at the slightest sign of a deal."" But he said he was ""a bit more sceptical about the outcome"" given how little time remained to negotiate and the difficulties of getting a deal through the British Parliament. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Shares and the pound jumped last week on growing optimism of a deal, only to slip amid signals from Brussels that the negotiations still had a long way to go. 'Right direction' But on Tuesday, Brussels' chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier sparked another rise on the markets when he said it was ""high time to turn good intentions [into] a legal text"". Irish PM Leo Varadkar said talks were ""moving in the right direction"". Boris Johnson has spoken to France's Emmanuel Macron and the BBC understands the two men agreed there was ""positive momentum"", although ""many hurdles"" must still be overcome.

Health expert raises Cwmfelinfach waste site concern,"By Jordan DaviesBBC News The rare weather phenomenon of temperature inversion could trap the plant's emissions over Cwmfelinfach, an Aneurin Bevan health board boss said. Residents raised the issue before Caerphilly council approved the plans in December. The firm involved said emissions would have a ""negligible"" impact. Dr Gillian Richardson, executive director of public health at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, has written to officials at Natural Resources Wales (NRW) recommending they ""exercise caution"" when considering granting the plant a permit. The environmental body is consulting on whether to approve the development. 'No safe threshold' Temperature inversion is where cold air is trapped in a valley by warm air above, preventing clouds and smog from escaping. Residents opposing the development have argued it could also trap emissions. The health board said temperature inversion was not taken into account in the original air quality assessment. It recognised that any emissions would be within legal limits. But Dr Richardson said new data showed the development would cause ""significant short-term local air quality deterioration within an area of deprivation, including vulnerable populations"". She claimed ""there is no known safe threshold of exposure"" to an emission like nitrogen dioxide, which can irritate lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections, such as influenza. The proposed plant would turn 100,000 tonnes a year of household, industrial and commercial waste, which would normally go to landfill, into fuel. The company behind it, Hazrem Environmental Limited, said nitrogen dioxide could be produced by any kind of factory. A spokesman said: ""The initial air quality assessment which was provided to NRW was based on a worst case scenario, as the exact specification of the dryer had not been received at the time of the permit application back last year. ""The dryer specification has now been decided on and the supplier has said that the NOx (mono-nitrogen oxides) emissions will be closer to 50mg/m3 rather than the predicted 300mg/m3 used in the air quality assessment. ""This updated information will be passed to both NRW and Public Health Wales for their consideration."" A Caerphilly council spokesman said: ""In considering a planning application such as this, a broad range of assessments and surveys, including those on air quality and transport are given careful consideration before a decision is determined."" NRW operations manager Jon Goldsworthy added: ""When we consider any application we look at the potential impact it could have and consult with health specialists. ""As part of the permit determination we will consider all the information available to us before we make a final decision.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
MH17 crash brings Ukraine conflict 'to West's door',"Commentators and members of the public are united on Ukrainian television channels in accusing the separatists and Russia of shooting the plane down. One theme that comes through strongly is the hope that the worldwide dimension of the tragedy might focus attention on Ukraine's problems. 'Turning point' One woman in the crowd of people laying flowers at the Dutch embassy in Kiev, told STB TV that the ""remote local conflict"" in eastern Ukraine was ""now knocking at the West's door"". A similar sentiment is common on Ukrainian social media, where users say the crash should be a wake-up call for the West and prompt it to impose tougher sanctions against Russia. The press also sees wider significance in the crash. One commentator in the popular daily Segodnya says the crash is a ""turning point"" in the conflict: ""From now on this is an international conflict. Whatever Russia says now, its propaganda will no longer work."" Another Segodnya writer hopes the West will send Ukraine advanced arms or even deploy troops. The generally pro-Russian daily Vesti says the crash may a mark a ""point of no return"", and Ukraine and Russia could descend into full-scale war: ""It could be a turning point in the situation in Ukraine, and even world history"". 'Political dividends' Not all of Russia's more tightly-controlled broadcast media lead on the story. Pro-government channels continue to press the official line that the separatists do not have weapons capable of shooting down an airliner, and that Ukraine is to blame. Pro-government dailies and tabloids accuse Ukraine and its media of trying to exploit the tragedy, while independent broadsheets provide more balanced coverage. Pro-Kremlin Izvestiya says: ""Kiev rushed to make political dividends from the tragedy, and the Ukrainian media unleashed a major campaign to blame the crash on the separatist militia."" The populist tabloid Tvoi Den says ""witnesses"" told it a Ukrainian military plane was seen tracking the airliner at high altitude. Analyst Alexei Arbatov tells the liberal RBK Daily that the implications for Russia could be ominous - ""if this situation ends up escalating into a new Cold War, the consequences for Russia would be far graver than they ever were for the USSR, since Russia is not a global superpower"".

Russia bans Azerbaijani tomatoes over 'pesticide concerns',"The move comes after Azerbaijan fought Russia's ally Armenia in a six-week war over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The prohibition comes into force on Thursday, which is the day Azerbaijan will hold a victory parade. Some analysts see the tomato ban as a riposte. The embargo is ""Russia's response to Azerbaijan's victory parade,"" Gubad Ibadoghlu, a policy analyst at the Baku Economic Research Center in Azerbaijan, told AFP news agency. But Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said the ban was necessary to ""prevent the import and spread"" of pesticides to Russia after it said it identified dangerous substances in recent cargo. Azerbaijan's tomatoes account for more than 30% of the fruit supplied to Russia. Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union until it proclaimed independence in 1991, and Russia has long been an important trading partner for the country of nearly 10 million people. Petroleum products are Azerbaijan's top export. Russia is keen to show it remains powerful in the Caucasus region but experts say the war revealed the limitations of its reach in its former empire. Analyst Gubad Ibadoghlu added that Russia - a key supplier of weaponry to Armenia - would see the display of Armenian military equipment seized by Azerbaijan during its victory parade as a snub. What happened in the conflict? Fighting broke out on 27 September between Armenia and Azerbaijan but it was the latest in a series of skirmishes and wars since the late 1980s. The two countries had never resolved the territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. That region is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is majority Armenian and it is largely controlled by Armenia. Azerbaijan is majority Muslim and has close ties to Turkey, while Armenia is largely Christian and allied to Russia. After six weeks, the fighting stopped at the end of November when both sides agreed to sign a Russian-brokered peace deal. Azerbaijan gained control of several areas, which it will hold onto, and Armenia promised to withdraw troops from them. Armenia says 2,425 of its soldiers were killed, while Azerbaijan claims to have lost 2,783 of its forces. At least 143 civilians were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced after losing their homes to destruction or leaving when soldiers entered their communities.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BBC to argue for licence fee to be linked to inflation,"The BBC commissioned the ""blue-skies"" report to explore future funding options, featuring views from a panel of independent economists, media experts and academics. It also recommended making better use of commercial revenues to boost funds. The BBC denied claims it backed the introduction of a subscription service. ""The report recommends that the BBC pursue an inflationary licence fee increase with greater commercial revenue. No subscription model is recommended,"" the corporation said a statement. It follows a report in The Sunday Times claiming the BBC was calling for the licence fee to be scrapped. The current fee has been frozen at £145.50 since 2010. It is up for renewal at the end of 2016, with some suggestion negotiations could start as early as this year. However the BBC's report looked at ideas for funding from 2020. A draft version also recommended the BBC consider coming out of public ownership and becoming a mutual, owned by its users, if an inflation rise for the licence fee was ruled out by the government. Director general Tony Hall recently defended the licence fee, suggesting it should be extended to include people watching programmes via the iPlayer service. ""There is room for modernisation so that the fee applies to the consumption of BBC TV programmes, whether live on BBC One or on-demand via the iPlayer,"" Lord Hall told a media conference in Oxford last month. Last week he confirmed BBC Three would be moved to the iPlayer in autumn 2015, with its budget slashed from £85m to £25m. BBC One drama will receive a £30m boost from the closure, in a move that is ""strategically right and financially right too"", the director general said. The BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, said the future of BBC Four was not certain either. ""We can't keep offering the same with less money. If future funding for the BBC comes under threat, the likelihood is we would have to take more services along the same route,"" he said. Meanwhile ministers are considering plans to make not paying the TV licence a civil offence, rather than a criminal one. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the proposal, backed by more than 100 MPs, should be part of talks surrounding the renewal of the BBC charter in 2016. In 2012 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence, more than one in 10 of the criminal prosecutions that year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"NI traveller community 'out of sight, out of mind'","The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission said it had found 13 systematic concerns around traveller accommodation. These included inadequacy of sites for travellers and racial discrimination. The report will be launched officially later on Tuesday. It makes 45 recommendations in order to tackle the problems it outlines. Les Allamby, chief commissioner, said travellers face ""the unpalatable choice of living in poor conditions to retain their culture or moving into standard social housing at the expense of their way of life"". 'Square pegs' ""We have found examples of inadequate facilities such as washing units not fit for purpose in the Northern Ireland climate, fire and other health and safety issues that need to be remedied,"" he said. ""The commission is concerned that legislation, policy and a lack of service provision amounts to an attitude of 'out of sight out of mind'."" He added that the commission had ""found an erosion of nomadic life through the policies and practices that have been developed and applied to travellers and travellers' accommodation"". ""This needs to change,"" he said. A traveller interviewed during the course of the investigation told the commission that ""all travellers are square pegs and (the public authorities) are trying to place them into round holes"". Another traveller said that those in the community can feel isolated when they move into a house. ""There's nothing to do... you walk out the door of a caravan everybody's there, but you walk out the door of a house and there's nobody there."" Among the other ""systematic concerns"" highlighted in the report was provision of traveller-specific accommodation, resources for traveller accommodation and a lack of emphasis on travellers being involved in the decision-making process. The Housing Executive said it would take the report's findings on board. In a statement, the executive said: ""We are already implementing many of the actions which are included in the commission's recommendations. ""As recommended in the report, we agree that increased participation and consultation with the Irish Traveller community is needed. ""In terms of the accommodation requirements of the Irish Traveller community, we are completing a needs assessment and will consult with the Irish Travellers and the wider community on housing need/ preferences and land availability.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
World Chess Championship: Magnus Carlsen retains title,"He beat Caruana in three time-limited games, ending the American's hopes of becoming the first US champion since Bobby Fischer won in 1972. This showdown followed a new record, in which all 12 matches of regular play were drawn. Carlsen told the BBC that the win was ""huge for me"". ""Fabiano played very well and he's an extremely strong player so it's very special,"" he said. ""It was very tense for these whole three weeks and there was no point in particular where I felt I was going to win the match. I didn't particularly feel that I was losing it either. It was always hanging in the balance."" Caruana, however, told Norway's NRK TV that he had had a ""bad day"". ""I didn't even put up a fight,"" he said. Carlsen, who has won the championship three times before and was the favourite to win the game, took a two-match lead and needed only a draw in the third tie-breaker to seal his victory. But Caruana resigned in the third as it became increasingly clear the Norwegian would win. Players needed to win the best of four of these shortened games to take the title. While there have been longer streaks of draws in chess, the lack of a win or loss in the entire championship battle set the new record. ""The match has made history, though of an ignoble kind,"" the World Chess broadcast's tournament report on the 12th and final regular game said, reflecting the frustration of some viewers after so many draws. Carlsen's tie-breaker victory came after he seemed to play for the tie-breaker event in the final regular game - drawing criticism from former world champion Garry Kasparov, who said the ""shocking draw offer"" showed he was ""losing his nerve"" and no longer favourite to win. Vladimir Kramnik, another Russian chess grandmaster, said: ""He might be tired of tension, fighting; maybe even of chess itself to a certain degree."" However, the Norwegian is ranked number one worldwide for fast-paced games, whereas Caruana is ranked at number 18. ""I'm a bit surprised that it's never occurred to anybody that I might know what's best for me,"" Carlsen told the BBC. ""It was a purely sporting decision and regardless of the result today I would have felt that it was the right one. After Carlsen's victory, Kasparov tweeted that his consistency was ""phenomenal"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New York sinkhole: Man's horror over fall into rat-infested chasm,"Leonard Shoulders was walking by a bus stop in the Bronx area on Saturday when the concrete cracked beneath his feet. A chasm up to 4.5m (15ft) deep swallowed Mr Shoulders, trapping him underground for about 30 minutes. New Yorkers have described reports of his ordeal as a ""nightmare"". ""Rats crawling on him, he can't move,"" his brother, Greg White, told CBS New York. ""He didn't want to yell because he was afraid there were going to be rats inside his mouth."" Firefighters were called to the scene, where a CCTV camera had captured the moment 33-year-old Mr Shoulders suddenly disappeared into the pavement. ""I looked down and the guy was only moving his hand,"" one witness said. Eventually, an emergency crew managed to rescue Mr Shoulders from the hole. Video showed him being wheeled into an ambulance on a stretcher. He was taken to St Barnabas Hospital after suffering injuries to his arms, legs and face. As of Thursday, he remained there in a stable condition, the hospital told the New York Times. ""He's traumatised,"" his mother, Cindy White, told NBC New York. ""He said he went straight down, and he was falling, falling, but the debris was falling and hitting him in the head."" The man's fall drew a visceral reaction from New Yorkers, many of whom described his ordeal as a ""nightmare"". Rats have long been prevalent in New York. Rodent experts say more rats have been coming out of hiding to find food during the coronavirus pandemic. More on rats in New York: Saturday's incident in the Bronx is under investigation. Local authorities said a section of the pavement had collapsed above a vault that was in a state of disrepair. A fence was erected around the building, which inspectors have ordered to be vacated. It is not clear who owns the building, nor who is responsible for maintaining the pavement in front of it. Mr Shoulder's family have been shaken by the incident, with relatives telling the New York Times legal action was being considered. ""It was like a one out of million chance of that happening,"" Mr White told CBS New York. ""I was shocked. I was surprised. But you know, he's breathing.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Turkish bus attack: 13 off-duty soldiers killed by car bomb,"The blast destroyed the bus carrying soldiers visiting a local market in the city of Kayseri. An army spokesman said civilians may also have been injured. No group has admitted carrying out the attack, but Turkish officials say it bears the hallmarks of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). It comes a week after 44 people were killed in a PKK attack in Istanbul. Regional governor Suleyman Kamci said the blast in Kayseri, a usually calm industrial hub in Central Anatolia, was carried out by a suicide bomber parked next to the bus near the entrance to Erciyes University. The soldiers were said to be on leave from a nearby military base. Seven people have been arrested in connection with the blast Images from the scene showed the bus reduced to a smouldering wreck with a massive hole punched in one side. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said the materials used were similar to those used in Istanbul. ""All indications at present point to the PKK,"" he said. President Tayyip Erdogan said that Kurdish militants were attempting to ""trip up Turkey, cut its strength and have it focus its energy and forces elsewhere"". Turkey has suffered a series of fatal bombings in 2016 at the hands of both the Kurdish militants and jihadists. Can Turkey break the wave of attacks? By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Istanbul It is now a depressingly familiar cycle for this country: A bombing, followed by promises from the government to eradicate terror and then reprisal attacks against the PKK. And yet the attacks keep coming - and Turkey keeps grieving. The condemnation after the violence seems frustratingly empty. How can Turkey break the wave of attacks? Security has been massively increased across Turkish cities - armed police roam the streets and new metal detectors have been put in place. But in a country of 80 million people, which borders Iraq and Syria and which has faced a decades-long Kurdish insurgency, only better intelligence can really stem this tide. Turkey's intelligence agency is powerful - and reinforced by its counterparts like the American FBI and the British MI6, which have representatives here. But there are clearly holes that are allowing attackers to slip through the net. And Turkey is paying a heavy price for the failings. Later on Saturday, a crowd stormed the Kayseri offices of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), parliament's second-largest opposition party. The HDP condemned the bombing in the city and called for an end to ""the politics, tone and language that creates tension, polarization, hostility, chaos and conflict"". The government imposed a temporary black-out on media coverage in the wake of the Kayseri blast. An instruction from the prime minister's office urged the media to refrain from publishing anything that may cause ""fear in the public, panic and disorder and which may serve the aims of terrorist organizations"", the Associated Press reported.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Q&A: A4e row,"What is A4e? The name stands for Action for Employment and the company's core business is helping people find work. It works with government, private firms, the public sector and others in Europe, Asia and Australia. Set up in Sheffield in 1991 to help retrain redundant steel workers, it expanded across the UK - where it has 200 offices and employs more than 3,500 people - and abroad. It has been working with UK governments since 1997. What happened? The firm is at the centre of two investigations - one a police probe into alleged fraud into its offices in Slough, Berkshire, the other involving a team of auditors from the Department for Work and Pensions. Four former members of staff were arrested on suspicion of fraud in February and bailed. It is understood the police probe does not relate to the company's work on the government's Work Programme. But the DWP launched its own investigation in March, following an allegation of attempted fraud in connection with its Mandatory Work Activity scheme. Why has it hit the headlines? Because the firm handles millions of pounds worth of government contracts for its welfare-to-work schemes - a key part of its policy to overhaul the benefits system. It is involved in the government's Work Programme - which sees contractors paid to help find work for the long-term unemployed. And its former chairman, Emma Harrison, was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron to be the government's ""family champion"" in 2010. She quit that role, and the chairmanship, in February saying she did not want the ""media focus on me to be any distraction for A4e"". What does A4e say? A4e says the alleged fraud being investigated by the police dated back to 2010 and had been uncovered by its own investigation. A4e chief executive Andrew Dutton said the company had ""zero tolerance"" towards fraud and was committed to using taxpayers' money to deliver the best public services. He said: ""I will not sit by and let these accusations discredit the hard work that our staff do to support thousands of people into work."" What does the government say? The Department for Work and Pensions says it is taking the matter very seriously and, if any evidence of ""systemic fraud"" is uncovered, it will terminate its commercial relationship with the firm.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Co-op Bank to shed 350 jobs and close branches,"As well as jobs lost due to the branch closures, the cuts also include middle management and head office roles. The bank said that, where possible, it would look to redeploy colleagues. Coronavirus is accelerating the trend away from the High Street to online. Earlier this month, NatWest said it was cutting 550 jobs in branches. The Co-op Bank's chief executive, Andrew Bester, said was ""very sorry"" for the cuts, which he also blamed on the current record low interest rates. ""We're not immune to the impact of recent events, with the historically low base rate affecting the income of all banks and a period of prolonged economic uncertainty ahead, which means it's important we reduce costs and have the right-sized operating model in place for the future,"" he said. ""We are responding to the continuing shift of more and more customers choosing to bank online, with lower levels of transactions in branches, a trend which has been increasing for some time, across the banking sector and more broadly."" The 18 branches being closed will shut by the end of the year. The bank said it had looked carefully at customer numbers using the branches before picking the 18 for closure. It said it was writing to affected customers to provide information about the alternative options available to them, including Post Office counter services, telephone, online and mobile banking. 'Particularly painful' Rob MacGregor, national officer at the Unite union, said: ""Unite is deeply disappointed that The Co-operative Bank has made the decision to cut 350 staff and close 18 bank branches. ""Job losses are always unwelcome, however given the repeated restructuring exercises that this workforce has been through over the past 10 years the news today will be particularly painful."" The Co-op Bank almost collapsed in 2013 when it uncovered a £1.5bn black hole in its accounts. At the time it was bailed out by US hedge funds. In 2017, the bank agreed a £700m rescue package to stop it from being wound up. The deal meant that the Co-operative Group's stake in the bank fell to just 1%.

Hillsborough trial: David Duckenfield case 'breathtakingly unfair',"Ben Myers QC made the claim in his closing speech at Preston Crown Court in defence of the 74-year-old. He denies gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans, on 15 April 1989. Mr Myers also said ""it must be one of the most heartbreaking cases ever to come before an English court"". He said it was obvious now, but not then, of the dangers of putting large numbers of people in confined spaces in pens. Football was plagued by hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s and was a ""world away"" from today's game, he said. ""It affected how police planned the event and how they would react as matters unfolded."" He said it was ""humbling"" to be addressing the court ""because of the scale of the case and the scale of the loss"". 'Decade of incompetence' The barrister told the jury failings at Hillsborough included faulty police radios, poor signage, a reduction in police manpower and stadium structure - none of which was Mr Duckenfield's fault. He said his client was an ""excellent police officer"" who less than three weeks to prepare for the game after being promoted. ""He was faced with something that no-one had foreseen, no-one had planned for and no-one could deal with."" Mr Myers said the jury was being invited to ""give him criminal responsibility for a decade of incompetence on the part of others"". The barrister told the court the case against his client, who chose not to give evidence, was heavily based on hindsight, adding: ""In the real world you get one go."" He said the Hillsborough stadium ""was potentially lethal"" and there had been a ""history of near-misses"". ""It's like giving a captain a ship that's already sinking and judging him on how well he sails it,"" Mr Myers added. ""The system he was working with was riddled with system faults. It's not a fair start."" At one point he turned to the defendant and said: ""Look at him now. Someone has to stand up for him. We do that, and we do it with vigour. He is an ageing man and not in the best of health."" Mr Myers said it would be ""very wrong indeed"" to convict Mr Duckenfield ""as a way of expressing"" sympathy over what happened. Mr Myers also said it was ""utterly wrong and deeply unfair"" that the jury was shown video footage of the disaster by the prosecution. He said: ""It is not right to bridge evidential gaps with emotion and strong feeling."" On Thursday, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" and should have made ""lifesaving decisions"". Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety Act. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Birth and death of stars captured by Very Large Telescope,"By Melissa HogenboomScience reporter, BBC News It also shows the remnants a supernova explosion caused by the death of a massive star that has run out of fuel. Located about 163,000 light-years away, the LMC is visible with the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere. The detailed image was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. Its nebulae - the thick clouds of gas around young and old stars - house active star-forming regions. Their brilliant glow is caused by the intense heat generated when new young stars are born, stars that burn very brightly but live relatively short lives when compared with our own Sun. Due to its unique shape, the cluster on right of the image has been nicknamed the Dragon's Head Nebula, though its official name is the catchy NGC 2035 (new general catalogue). Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer who worked at the Chile observatory for many years, said that a lot of imagination was needed to see a dragon's head. ""Most of these names were given when the telescopes were not as good as they are today, so you have to imagine a blurry thumbnail version of it,"" he explained. And the vibrant colours of the nebulae give clues to how hot the young stars are inside them. The blue stars are huge, hot stars that live a short but very bright life, while the redder ones are much colder. As a star ionises surrounding gas, it kicks the electrons out of atoms which then radiate light in signature spectral lines. The darker lines that are visible are clusters of dust mixed in with the gas - their darker colour results from light absorption rather than light emission. Once massive stars burn their fuel, they become increasingly unstable until they collapse and violently explode as supernovas, remnants of which are visible on the left of the image. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a small satellite galaxy - smaller than the Milky Way, or the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, which can also be seen with the naked eye. While it spans 14,000 light-years, the LMC contains less than one tenth of the mass of the Milky Way, which covers some 100,000 light-years. It was named after Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese-born navigator, who noticed the nebulae on his voyage to the Southern Hemisphere. Dr Hainaut said that pictures like this were very beautiful, like art. ""The next step is that you realise we are watching little pieces of the Universe next door. Just to see all these stars that are being born - it's a really nice story to see that our Universe is moving and evolving,"" he told BBC News.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Social care cuts 'major cause' of A&E problems,"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News Research by the charity showed the numbers getting help had fallen from just over one million three years ago to 850,000 last year. Age UK said the cuts were one of the major causes behind the growing pressures on A&E units. But councils said they had been left with little choice because they were ""chronically underfunded"". The overall cut in numbers getting help from councils represents a drop of one-fifth. But the research - based on an analysis of official figures - also provided a detailed breakdown of which individual services had been cut. It found between 2010-11 and 2013-14: Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Our state-funded social care system is in calamitous, quite rapid decline. ""The more preventive services like meals on wheels and day care are being especially hard hit, leaving the system increasingly the preserve of older people in the most acute need, storing up big problems for the future. ""Hundreds of thousands of older people who need social care are being left high and dry. The lucky ones have sufficient funds to buy in some support, or can rely on the goodwill of family, neighbours and friends. But there are many who are being left to struggle on entirely alone."" Previous research by the charity has shown there are nearly 900,000 people who do not get any help for their care needs. ""Until recently the impact of the decline in social care has been relatively hidden, but social care is a crucial pressure valve for the NHS and the evidence of what happens when it is too weak to fulfil that function is clear for us all to see,"" Ms Abrahams added. Over the past three months waiting times in A&E units have reached their worst level for a decade with hospitals reporting they are experiencing particular problems trying to discharge old and frail patients because of the lack of support available in the community. Vulnerable people Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said the system was ""chronically underfunded"". ""Councils have protected our most vulnerable people as far as possible, often at the expense of other services, and we will continue to prioritise those most in need. ""However, the combined pressures of insufficient funding, growing demand, escalating costs and a 40% cut to local government budgets across this parliament mean that despite councils' best efforts they are having to make tough decisions about the care services they can provide."" But a Department of Health spokeswoman said the April launch of the Better Care Fund - a £5.3bn pot predominantly funded from the NHS to encourage greater integration between health and care - would help. ""We know we need to work differently to respond to our growing ageing population."" She added the fund would ""focus resources on helping people to live independently, which will save money and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump Russia: FBI probed whether Trump was working for Moscow - NYT,"Law enforcement officials became concerned by Mr Trump's behaviour in May 2017, when he sacked FBI director James Comey, the paper says. The investigation reportedly examined whether Mr Trump was a national security threat. Mr Trump said there was no reason and no proof for setting up such a probe. ""This is absurd,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI,"" she said in a statement. ""Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."" In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had launched cyber-attacks and planted fake news stories on social media in a bid to boost Donald Trump and damage his rival for the presidency, Hillary Clinton. What did the FBI supposedly investigate? The New York Times report said the FBI investigation was a joint counterintelligence and criminal probe. The counterintelligence part sought to establish whether Mr Trump was knowingly aiding the Kremlin against America's interests, or ""had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence"". The criminal aspect concerned the president's sacking of Mr Comey, and whether it was an obstruction of justice. The ex-FBI director told a congressional hearing that Mr Trump told him ""I expect loyalty,"" and pressured him to end an inquiry into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. What happened to the inquiry? The paper says the FBI investigation was rolled into the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an inquiry into whether Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 US election. Mr Mueller was appointed within days of Mr Comey's firing. Mr Trump has denied any complicity with Russia, and called the Mueller probe ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". Nonetheless, the inquiry has put some of the president's closest associates in the dock. His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance and fraud crimes while his campaign chief Paul Manafort was convicted of financial fraud. The Times said it was not clear if the counterintelligence part of the FBI inquiry was still being pursued. The paper's report cited unnamed former law enforcement officials, ""others familiar with the investigation,"" and the congressional testimony of former FBI general counsel James.

"Britain's Got Talent: Complaints rise to 15,000 for Diversity performance","The number of complaints about the episode has shot up from 1,121 on Tuesday and 10,267 on Thursday. The dance saw Ashley Banjo being knelt on by a police officer, a reference to George Floyd's death in police custody. Media watchdog Ofcom said ""almost all"" relate to Diversity. Ashley's brother Jordan said on Wednesday that the response was ""sad, genuinely"". ITV said the performance opened up ""important topics of conversation"" and ""was complied for a family audience"". Ashley Banjo has explained that the group had wanted to use the routine to ""express how the events of this year have made us feel"". Jordan and Perri Kiely, two other key members, spoke about the performance and complaints on their Kiss breakfast show on Wednesday. ""It was really important, it was special to us, and we're all about positivity and love, and we got so much positivity and love back from this one,"" Jordan said. ""But we also got bombarded with messages and articles and horrible stuff about all of us, about our families, about how even now Diversity isn't diverse enough because there's only five white people in it. ""I can't speak for anyone else, but it's sad. It's sad, genuinely. I feel anxious and worried saying something like black lives matter when that's all we want, man. It's just love and positivity. No-one's saying only black lives matter."" Earlier this week, an Ofcom spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate."" The performance attracted both praise and scorn on social media for its political stance, with Ashley Banjo referring to both in a tweet after the show. Part of the performance saw Banjo lying on the floor while a dancer dressed as a police officer handcuffed him. Other performers crowded around with smartphones as if to film and take photos of the incident. The dance was also narrated, and included the line: ""What we thought we knew, some clearly didn't. Black Lives Matter."" The group, who won the talent show in 2009, then all took a knee before the song Black Lives Matter by Dax began, which features the lyrics ""I can't breathe"", the words Mr Floyd repeatedly said as he was restrained. A BGT spokesperson said earlier this week: ""Diversity's performance offered their take on the extraordinary events of 2020 opening up important topics of conversation. The show was complied for a family audience."" Ashley Banjo has taken Simon Cowell's place on the judging panel for this series after Cowell injured his back.

Chile country profile,"The exception was the 17-year rule of General Augusto Pinochet, whose 1973 coup was one of the bloodiest in 20th-century Latin America and whose dictatorship left more than 3,000 people dead and missing. Chile's unusual, ribbon-like shape - 4,300 km long and on average 175 km wide - has given it a hugely varied climate. This ranges from the world's driest desert - the Atacama - in the north, through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a snow-prone Alpine climate in the south, with glaciers, fjords and lakes. Chile is a multi-ethnic society, including people of European and Indian ancestry. FACTS Republic of Chile Capital: Santiago Population 17.9 million Area 756,096 sq km (291,930 sq miles) Major language Spanish Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 77 years (men), 82 years (women) Currency Chilean peso LEADER President: Sebastian Piñera Sebastian Piñera won the presidential election in December 2017, having already served as president for four years until 2014. Local markets soared on hopes of more investor-friendly policies expected to be introduced by the billionaire conservative. He faced major protests in late 2019 over price increases and social inequality, and agreed to a referendum that backed rewriting the constitution to remove guarantees for the private sector in the provision of some public services. MEDIA Chile's national and local terrestrial TV channels operate alongside extensive cable TV networks, which carry many US and international stations. Radio is an important source of news; there are hundreds of stations, most of them commercial. TIMELINE Some key dates in Chile's history: 1535 - Indigenous Araucanian people successfully resist first Spanish invasion of Chile. 1541 - Pedro de Valdivia begins Spanish conquest and founds Santiago. 1810 - Junta in Santiago proclaims autonomy for Chile following the overthrow of the king of Spain by Napoleon, but Spain regains control of Chile in 1814. 1818 - Chile becomes independent. 1879-84 - Chile increases its territory by one third after it defeats Peru and Bolivia in War of the Pacific. Late 19th century - Pacification of indigenous Araucanians paves way for European immigration; large-scale mining of nitrate and copper begins. 1891 - Civil war over constitutional dispute between president and congress ends in congressional victory, with president reduced to figurehead. 1970 - Salvador Allende becomes world's first democratically elected Marxist president and embarks on an extensive programme of nationalisation and radical social reform. 1973 - Chief of Staff General Augusto Pinochet ousts Allende in coup and proceeds to establish a brutal dictatorship which lasts until 1990. 1989 - Elections mark return to civilian rule.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
University of Wales Newport vice-chancellor Peter Noyes to stand down,"Dr Peter Noyes had recently claimed there was a ""conspiracy"" to force the university to merge with two others. The chair of governors praised his ""outstanding leadership"" during which a new city centre campus was created. Dr Noyes said: ""I am very sorry to be leaving an institution and a role I have loved but my family must come first at a time like this."" He will step down in July after 16 years at the university, the last six of which he has spent as vice-chancellor. Differing visions Dr Noyes has spoken of his concern over new finance arrangements by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (Hefcw) which could mean 20% fewer students next year. He has been critical of what he called a ""conspiracy"" against Newport to ""force us into a merged situation with the two other institutions,"" the University of Glamorgan and Cardiff Metropolitan University. He has said his preference would be the creation of a new entrepreneurial university for the region rather than a merger of existing institutions. In April, Newport learned it would lose 300 student places - a cut of 20% - in a new funding structure. Dr Noyes said at the time that he believed it was a move to force the university to merge. Speaking about his decision to step down, he said: ""I am sorry to be leaving in such circumstances and at such a critical time for the university. However I need to put all my focus on my personal life. ""It's the right decision for me but also for Newport. The institution needs someone who can give its future, and particularly the delivery of a new university for the region, their full attention. ""It's been an honour and a privilege to work with staff and students at Newport. I've learnt a lot and enjoyed my time here immensely. ""But to continue as vice-chancellor at the present time would not be fair on my family or on those who work so hard to deliver Newport's mission of widening access and social justice."" 'Huge turmoil' Dr Noyes, a chartered psychologist, held academic posts at the universities of Bristol and Gloucester before moving to Newport. He also sits on the board of Newport Unlimited, the city's urban regeneration company. Andrew Wilkinson, chairman of the board of governors at the university, said: ""Peter has provided outstanding leadership in a period of huge turmoil and the demands placed on him personally have been massive. ""The university owes him a huge debt of gratitude and we have total respect for the leadership he has provided. ""We will now seek to build on Peter's legacy and ensure the university continues to move forward and retain the momentum we have gained as a result of his tenure.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Dyffryn House, Vale of Glamorgan gets £600,000 award","The work on Grade II* listed Dyffryn House will restore its late-Victorian interiors designed in French Renaissance and English Baroque styles. The grant will also be used to employ an interpretation and learning officer and to train volunteers. The house near St Nicholas has been closed to the public since 1996, but is due to reopen to visitors next year. The three-storey mansion was built by coal tycoon John Cory in 1893 and is considered to be one of the most important houses of its period. It is the centrepiece of the 55 acre Grade I listed Dyffryn Gardens, now run as a tourist attraction by the Vale of Glamorgan council. The gardens currently attract 52,000 visitors a year and are regularly used for events. They also include an arboretum and an observatory run by Cardiff Astronomical Society. The Heritage Lottery Fund previously awarded a total of over £6.15m to restore the gardens' features and landscapes in 1997 and 2005. Dan Clayton Jones, chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) in Wales, said: ""This award is the final piece in the jigsaw of the restoration project at Dyffryn. ""The house is one of the most important to have survived from the period and reflects the enormous wealth amassed by John Cory over 100 years ago. ""We are delighted that the HLF grant will reopen the house and reunite it once more with the gardens as it was originally designed, creating one fantastic space for visitors to enjoy."" The council hopes the reopening of the house will double visitor numbers to the gardens within 10 years. Rhodri Traherne, the council's cabinet member for economic development and regeneration, said: ""Bringing the house back into use as part of the visitor experience at Dyffryn will be a significant development in making this an important heritage destination, benefiting not only Dyffryn but the region as a whole."" Staff at the attraction hope to build on the enthusiasm of 25 committed volunteers and more than 300 members of the Friends of Dyffryn Gardens to increase involvement of the local community. People of all ages will be encouraged to volunteer as researchers, flower arrangers, and tour guides in full Edwardian costume. Site curator Geraldine Donovan said a volunteer open day will be held on 5 May for people wanting to get involved. ""From the interest expressed so far by both friends and the community, we are confident that we will attract the new house volunteers which are essential to the project's success,"" she said. The restoration work is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012 to be followed by a series of events, activities, exhibitions and school visits.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
British Army to get 148 Challenger 3 tanks in £800m deal,"The Challenger 3 tanks will replace the existing Challenger 2 vehicles which have been in use since 1998. The vehicles will be produced at the Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) plant in Telford, Shropshire. Under the military restructure, announced in March, the overall number of tanks will be cut from 227. The tank contract is part of a defence review which will see the Army's size reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of an increased focus on drones and cyber warfare. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the Challenger 3 would be able to travel up to 60mph (97kph) with an increased range and be the UK's first fully-digitised tank. The digital elements mean the tank will be able to share data and information on the battlefield with attack helicopters and other ground vehicles. The contract will create 200 jobs at RBSL's plant, including 130 engineers and 70 technicians, the MoD said. It added it would also mean 450 new supply chain jobs spread across the West Midlands, Glasgow, Newcastle upon Tyne and the Isle of Wight. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the new jobs would ensure soldiers ""benefit from the very best of British engineering"". He added the new technology ""allows us to deliver immense warfighting capabilities in battlespaces filled with a range of enemy threats"". In the words of Ben Wallace, this announcement shows ""there is a future for tanks"". There will though be fewer of them. The British Army has 227 ageing Challenger 2 tanks. Only 148 of them will be modernised and they won't be entirely new. The Challenger 3 tank will use the existing chassis, but it will have a new digital turret and smoothbore gun. It will also have a more powerful engine. Will there be risks in bolting on new systems to the old? A similar plan to upgrade the Army's Warrior Armoured Vehicle didn't work out. That programme's now been scrapped. Ben Wallace insists it won't happen again. He says the Challenger 3 tank will deliver the most lethal tank in Europe. It's due to come into service by the end of the decade. In reality, designing an entirely new tank from scratch would have cost too much and taken too long. While buying a tank from another country - without creating British jobs - was clearly politically unpalatable. Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lt Gen Chris Tickell CBE, said: ""The integration of Challenger 3 is key to ensure our success and integration in the land domain, ensuring that we meet our international commitments and continue to protect the nation."" The Army expects to receive the first Challenger 3 tanks by 2027 with the final ones due in 2030. In November, RBSL was awarded a £860m contract to build 260 Boxer armoured vehicles for the Army.

Tory leadership hopeful Michelle Ballantyne defends benefits stance,"Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme Michelle Ballantyne said ""people can have as many children as they like"". But she insisted there was a question of fairness to people who are in work. Ms Ballantyne must secure the support of 100 party members to enter the contest officially. She has previously defended the ""two-child limit"" introduced to the benefits system under Universal Credit. In 2018 she told the Scottish Parliament that ""people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and don't claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have"". In the interview on her leadership bid, she told presenter Gary Robertson: ""What I said is that we need a level playing field. So people who are in work need to have the same opportunities as people who aren't in work."" Family income Ms Ballantyne said she was not telling people whether they should have children but ""it's about having a family income"". ""You can't go to your employer and say 'I've just decided to have another baby so could I have a pay rise please'. ""So this is about fairness."" If she secures the required support from members, Ms Ballantyne would join Jackson Carlaw in a contest to replace Ruth Davidson as Scottish Conservative leader. Ms Davidson resigned in August 2019, citing changes in her personal life and ""conflict"" over Brexit. Mr Carlaw has been the party's interim leader since Ms Davidson's departure. Grassroots members A number of MSPs and MPs have backed Mr Carlaw to take over on a permanent basis, but Ms Ballantyne said she was concentrating on winning support in the wider party. ""I don't know yet about the MSPs and the MPs,"" she said. ""But what I do know is that it's the grassroots, it's the membership that have been coming out in support for me so far and they're the people that I'm talking to. ""They're the people that really matter actually because we work for them."" Ms Ballantyne, the party's social security spokeswoman at Holyrood, has said it was important for the Scottish Conservatives to have a real contest for the leadership, not a ""coronation"" with only person considered for the job. Nominations close on 17 January. If there is a vote, the result will be announced on 14 February. Ms Ballantyne said her record of creating a manufacturing business, heading a charity and working in the health service would win support. She added: ""I do it and don't just talk about it.

Shafilea Ahmed death: Sister 'wrote of killing',"Shafilea's parents Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, deny murdering their daughter by suffocating her at their home in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2003. The prosecution at Chester Crown Court alleges Mevish Ahmed, 21, wrote to a friend detailing her sister's death. However, Ms Ahmed said the letters were ""free writing"" and ""fiction"". Prosecutor Andrew Edis said the documents, written in 2008, had only recently been shown to police by Mevish Ahmed's friend, Shahin Munir. He suggested to Ms Ahmed, who was 12 when Shafilea disappeared, that they were ""letters that you wrote to your friend about your sister's death"". ""These pieces of paper were about your parents killing Shafilea,"" he added. He said the letters included lines such as ""how did it happen?"", ""I wish I'd never seen it but I did"" and ""the same thing's going to happen to me"". However, she replied that they were ""not letters about my sister's death, they are free writing"". 'Chosen to lie' ""I write fiction, I write it quite a lot. Me and [sister] Alesha used to write fictional things and make-believe,"" she said. ""It's not necessarily associated with ourselves."" She added that she had been using drugs around the time the documents were written. Ms Ahmed was also asked about a telephone call made to Ms Munir during the second week of her parents' trial, in which the prosecution alleged her friend had apologised for handing the documents to the police. She initially denied any memory of the call but then said she had spoken to Ms Munir. However, she denied that, during the call, she had ""aggressively threatened"" her friend and demanded the handing over of diary notes made after a conversation about Shafilea's death in a park in 2008. The prosecution said to Ms Ahmed that ""you have made your choice - you have chosen to tell your parents' lies"". She said she was ""not going to sit here and lie"" and denied being scared of her parents. Mr Edis went on to question Ms Ahmed about her parents' relationship with her sister, asking her if, ""in the last year of her life, your sister had been happy and had a normal relationship with her parents?"" Ms Ahmed replied that she did. 'Run away before' Ms Ahmed added that she had last seen Shafilea on the evening of 11 September 2003. She told the jury that she had presumed Shafilea had ""run away"" and was staying with school friends. She told the jury that this was ""something that had happened before"". Mevish Ahmed is the second of Shafilea Ahmed's sisters to have appeared in court. Previously, Alesha Ahmed claimed she saw her parents Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, suffocate Shafilea with a plastic bag.

Her remains were found on the banks of the River Kent in Cumbria in 2004. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' over data collection,"Elizabeth Denham was giving evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into fake news. She said she was ""astounded"" by the amount of data held by companies such as Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, data brokers and political parties. She also added weight to calls for Mark Zuckerberg to appear before MPs. She stopped short of saying that he should come to the UK to answer questions posed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee's inquiry, something which has been demanded by MPs. But she did say that, in her investigation into Facebook's role, it was ""critical"" that she had direct access to executives based in the social media's new Mountain View offices. It would be ""very useful"" for Mr Zuckerberg to talk directly to MPs, she said. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) investigation into how the data of millions of Facebook users was harvested by an academic and shared with Cambridge Analytica was, she told MPs, ""unprecedented"", in terms of scale, cost and complexity. In October, the ICO fined Facebook the maximum of £500,000, over its involvement in the controversy. Ms Denham told MPs that Facebook needed ""to significantly change its business practices"". ""There is a fundamental tension between its business model and the protection of the privacy of users' data,"" she said. She also spoke about how she felt a new regulatory model was needed to deal with online misinformation and harmful and offensive user-generated content - one that was tougher on tech firms. ""The time for self-regulation is over. That ship has sailed,"" she said. She said that parliament needed to set the objectives, with a code of practice being drawn up by a hybrid regulator, combining the skills of Ofcom and the ICO. ""No country has tried this yet. It's quite controversial and the need to balance freedom of expression with the harms of the internet is hard,"" she told MPs. She also said that there needed to be an ""ethical pause"" to consider how political marketing should be conducted online in future. ""We have to ask whether the same model that sells us holidays, shoes and cars should be used to engage with voters"" she said.

"'It's Dr, not Ms,' insists historian","By Patrick EvansBBC News She tweeted after learning that the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail had proposed to change its house style to only refer to medical doctors by their titles. Instead, academics would just be called by their surname and prefix such as Mr, Mrs or Ms. ""It is outrageous,"" Fern told the BBC. ""This is our expertise and people need to know when someone is an expert. I am a firm believer that any academic - whether male or female - should have their title used as that is their qualification. That's what my tweet was about."" As is common on Twitter, a backlash ensued. ""A wave of men suddenly jumped into my mentions saying I was vulgar and immodest. It immediately then became a gender issue,"" said Fern. ""You're not better for being a Dr as you imply,"" wrote one detractor. Another tweeted: ""If you have to tell people you're an authority or an expert then you probably aren't."" #ImmodestWomen Fern admitted she was amused by the hostile reaction. ""I am lucky. I tend to just think it's hilarious,"" she said. ""Why are some men so threatened by female expertise? This is a very small section of men but they are very loud and very vocal and very aggressive."" In response to those decrying her as big-headed she decided to start the hashtag #ImmodestWomen. ""It's insane that women are qualified but feel they can only use the term Doctor at particular times. Women are still defined by whether they are married or not - for me my title is my identity, it is my career. ""I'm not going out on dates demanding people call me 'Doctor Fern' - and I think the people who assumed that were very strange."" Thousands are now joining in with her hashtag sharing their own stories. And women with PhDs have been adding ""Dr"" to their Twitter handles in solidarity. ""I will never not take pleasure from the moment that someone sneeringly looks at my left hand and says 'miss is it?' and I say, politely, 'Dr, actually'. I'm proud of it, and also value that it takes me out of a narrative that wants to define me by marital status."" tweeted Jo Taylor. ""Finally added 'Dr' to my Twitter profile after reading through these various threads. The idiocy on display is truly amazing,"" said Kavita Mudan Finn. ""The amount of women putting Dr in the handle was absolutely incredible,"" Fern told the BBC. ""You can clearly see that women have been taught to struggle with acknowledging their own authority and the huge backlash from lunatics online shows how women are taught to know their place,"" she said. In BBC style, the title Dr is used for doctors of medicine, scientific doctors and church ministers who hold doctorates, when relevant.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook security app used to 'spy' on competitors,"The cross-party group said that Facebook used its Onavo virtual private network (VPN) app to gather information on competitors. The MPs claim Facebook ""intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws"". The report, which is more than 100 pages long, also details the influence of fake news on the site in elections. Monitoring competitors The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee wrote that through the use of Onavo, which was billed as a way to give users an extra layer of security, Facebook could ""collect app usage data from its customers to assess not only how many people had downloaded apps, but how often they used them"". The report added: ""This knowledge helped them to decide which companies were performing well and therefore gave them invaluable data on possible competitors. They could then acquire those companies, or shut down those they judged to be a threat."" A graph the committee includes in the report shows an analysis of data collected with Onavo, detailing how commonly apps were used by Facebook owned and rival services. In 2013, Facebook offered to buy rival Snapchat for $3bn (£2.32bn). It acquired Instagram a year earlier for $1bn. In 2014, the company successfully acquired WhatsApp for $19bn in cash and shares. Limiting Vine The report also details the way the company could shut off access to its services to competitors. For example, in 2013 Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was informed about the launch of the Vine video service by social media rival Twitter. He was told via email that Twitter was going to allow Vine users to find friends on Facebook. ""Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends' API access today."" the email read - a move that would prevent Vine users from inviting their Facebook friends to the service. Zuckerberg agreed to the move, replying ""Yup, go for it."" Twitter eventually chose to close Vine in 2016. Whitelisting According to the report, as of November 2013, more than 5,000 apps on Facebook were ""whitelisted"", meaning that they could gain special access to user data and the data of those user's Facebook friends. Whitelisted companies included ride-hailing app Lyft, Airbnb and Netflix. An internal email discussed linking a yearly spend of $250,000 on advertising to maintain company access to user Facebook data. An email from Mr Zuckerberg, sent in October 2012, outlined his scepticism about the risk of data leaks happening between Facebook application developers. ""I think we leak info to developers, but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us,"" he wrote. Last year, Facebook was fined £500,000 by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The Information Commissioner's Office said that the social media giant had given developers access to user data ""without clear consent"". User data which was collected through a personality quiz was used by Cambridge Analytica to profile potential voters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New divorce form 'invites name and shame' of adulterers,"The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"". Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"". The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people. Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form. ""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said. ""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in."" 'An invitation broken hearts can't refuse' The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice. The guidance on the form highlights that it is ""not normally necessary"" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with. But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"". The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate. ""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained. ""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse."" If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs. According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015. Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. ""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815. Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"". ""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said. ""Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings."" Grounds for divorce in England and Wales: When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons: Source: Gov.UK A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms. ""As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so. This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Emmerdale is 'booziest' soap, study suggests","Emmerdale, EastEnders, Coronation Street and Hollyoaks were examined over a two-week period. The study also looked at exercising, drinking water and healthy eating. Emmerdale characters managed to consume 46 alcoholic drinks during the research period, with Coronation Street not far behind on 40 beverages. In a statement, a spokesperson for Emmerdale said it was a ""small community"", adding: ""Characters regularly meet in the pub where the focus is on story as opposed to alcohol intake. We present a balanced view of alcohol as we take our responsibilities for portraying alcohol consumption seriously."" Hollyoaks was named the healthiest UK soap overall, while EastEnders came second, followed by Emmerdale in third and Coronation Street in fourth spot. In total, 48% of activity in Hollyoaks was considered healthy, with EastEnders on 36%, Emmerdale on 18%, and Coronation Street on 15%. The Hollyoaks characters were the most active, with characters sitting down for just 15% of the episodes compared with Coronation Street's cast, who spent 31% on the couch. EastEnders characters enjoyed the most nights out, with 11 in total, while there were no evenings out on the town on Coronation Street. 'Play hard' Corrie's characters also consumed the most takeaways, while Emmerdale consumed the least. A spokesperson for Coronation Street said: ""We present a balanced view of alcohol consumption, healthy eating and the lifestyles of our characters as we take our responsibilities for these issues seriously. Characters do frequent the pub but we also see them engaging in exercise and we have explored lifestyle related health issues through many different storylines."" Lee Matthews of Fitness First, which conducted the study, said: ""While studying Hollyoaks, we saw that despite there being three big nights out, there were zero instances of smoking shown on screen. In comparison there were 13 instances of jogging, walking and playing a sport. ""Hollyoaks has demonstrated perfectly that we can play hard and still incorporate healthy habits along the way."" The show is aimed at a younger audience than the other soaps, which is reflected in its earlier broadcasting timeslot.

Harry Richford inquest: 'Lives at risk' over locum doctor recruitment,"Harry Richford's death after a series of failings at a hospital in Margate, Kent, was ruled ""wholly avoidable"". An inquest heard he was delivered by an ""inexperienced"" locum doctor who was new to the hospital. A national review into the recruitment, assessment and supervision of locums should be carried out, Christopher Sutton-Mattocks said in a report. The coroner wrote that particular emphasis should be considered upon the scope of locums' activities before they are left responsible for out-of-hours labour care. He issued 19 recommendations to prevent future deaths, including a request that NHS England and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists consider such a review, warning ""there may be a risk to other lives both at this trust and at other trusts in the future"". East Kent NHS Trust came under scrutiny after the inquest, in which Mr Sutton-Mattocks found more than a dozen areas of concern. An independent review will be held into maternity services at the trust after it was found up to 15 babies died there in recent years. The nationwide review should look at whether locums should be ""left responsible for out of hours care of women in labour"", Mr Sutton-Mattocks wrote. He said locum registrar Christos Spyroulis, who was in charge of delivering Harry on his third night at the hospital, appeared not to have had ""any assessment of his skills and abilities or any supervision"" after being hired. Failings in the way Harry was delivered led Myles Taylor, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, to conclude that Dr Spyroulis was ""inexperienced,"" the coroner found. 'Fully and swiftly' The inquest found these failings were followed by delays in resuscitation, led by another doctor. Expert evidence ""raises concerns that there may be a risk to other lives both at this trust and at other trusts in the future,"" said Mr Sutton-Mattocks. The majority of his recommendations were directed at East Kent NHS Trust, which said it accepted all the suggestions and had appointed a team lead by an external senior clinician to implement them ""fully and swiftly"". Locum doctors are now assessed before being left in charge overnight, the BBC understands. The Royal College said it is considering the coroner's recommendations and is already working with NHS England to improve maternity services at the trust. NHS England said Dr Bill Kirkup, who is leading the review of East Kent's maternity services, would also ""consider what wider regulatory or practice changes are needed to guarantee safe services at any other maternity units where concerns may arise"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poland must suspend judge discipline panel – ECJ,"The chamber was set up in 2017 by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, to handle disciplinary cases against judges. Opposition politicians and critics say this is an attempt by PiS to control Poland’s justice system. Now, the ECJ has ruled Poland must immediately suspend the chamber. It is the latest development in a long-running row between Poland and the EU over PiS’s radical judicial reforms. PiS is the governing party in Poland and controls its parliament. What did the court say? The European Commission asked the ECJ in January to consider the disciplinary chamber, arguing it was not up to EU standards of judicial independence. Judges chosen by the National Council of the Judiciary sit on that disciplinary chamber. But the PiS changed the law so that the parliament – which it controls – picks the member of that judicial council. This ECJ ruling states that the fact judges could be subject to such discipline from the chamber “is likely to affect their own independence”. And while each country in the EU has the right to organise its own judicial system, this disciplinary system “is likely to cause serious and irreparable harm” to legal order in the EU. Poland now has one month to comply with the European Commission’s request that the disciplinary chamber be separated from the parliament and from government, while the court makes its final ruling. After this time, the Commission can ask for a fine against Poland. What are the judicial reforms? PiS has introduced rules which mean judges can be punished for “political activity”. The nationalist party says the reforms are needed to tackle corruption. But critics and opposition members say it is an attempt by the party to control Poland’s justice system. In December, Poland’s Supreme Court warned the country may have to leave the EU if the judicial reforms continue. In recent days the party has also come under fire for changing the law so that May’s presidential election can go ahead – despite the coronavirus pandemic. Opposition parties say this is to boost the hopes of incumbent President Andrzej Duda, who is backed by PiS. But PiS say it is to protect the democratic process.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Litvinenko inquiry: Ex-spy 'investigating Stolichnaya vodka row',"Ex-FSB officer Mr Litvinenko was investigating a dispute over who owned Stolichnaya vodka, investigator Daniel Quirke told the inquiry into the death. He was asked to find intelligence on Russian minister Alexei Gordiev's involvement in the row he said. Mr Quirke also told how Mr Litvinenko had been ""spooked"" by the 2006 shooting of journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Mr Litvinenko, a former Russian security service officer who became a vocal critic of the Kremlin and fled to Britain, died of radiation poisoning after drinking tea laced with polonium at a hotel in London's Mayfair in November 2006. The barrister representing Mr Litvinenko's family claims he was murdered for trying to ""expose the corruption"" at the heart of Vladimir Putin's ""mafia state"". Mr Litvinenko was working for British intelligence agencies as well as private investigation firms during his time in the UK, the inquiry has heard. Mr Quirke, who worked for private security and investigations firm Risc Management, told the inquiry how Mr Litvinenko had been investigating a business dispute over Stolichnaya vodka, which involved the Russian government. A client of Risc Management had wanted information on Mr Gordiev's intentions over the row, he said. 'Scared of the state' ""The client wanted to know what kind of people they would be up against in the courts, were they going to pursue them, could it be stalled, what was going to happen in the long term,"" Mr Quirke said. Mr Litvinenko had identified Mr Gordiev as being ""corrupt"", the inquiry heard. Mr Quirke also told the inquiry how Mr Litvinenko had been ""scared of the state apparatus of Russia"". He was scared of Putin and believed he was a ""marked man,"" he added. Mr Quirke described Mr Litvinenko, who fled Russia in 2000 to seek asylum in the UK, as ""security conscious"" and was once spotted pacing up and down the street outside Risc's offices ""trying to throw off any tail that might be on him"". He also told the public inquiry how Mr Litvinenko had told him that Russian journalist Ms Politkovskaya had visited the headquarters of the Russian Security Service, the FSB. While there she she had been invited to fire a pistol in a shooting range but found the target had Mr Litvinenko's face on it. Mr Litvinenko believed this was a message to him, as the FSB knew Ms Politkovskaya was a friend of his, Mr Quirke said. Ms Politkovskaya, a leading critic of the Kremlin, was shot near her flat in Moscow in October 2006. The Litvinenko case",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Guildford Four man Gerry Conlon's 'living hell' revealed,"A letter written by Mr Conlon 12 years into his life term following the Guildford pub bombings in 1974 suggested he was thinking of killing himself. The wrongly-convicted men served 15 years before their release in 1989. It is widely regarded as one of the UK's worst miscarriages of justice. The letter was written from HMP Long Lartin in 1987 - seven years after the death in prison of Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, who was wrongly convicted on explosives charges after the IRA blasts. Mr Conlon wrote to the Irish tanaiste and foreign affairs minister Brian Lenihan: ""If nothing is done to help us, I must face another 18 years of a 'living hell'. ""I can assure you that I do not intend to serve it, I would much rather join my dear father. ""I can see that if my plight is not resolved in the near future that I will have to decide which form of protest I must take. ""This is not something I want to do but you can only suffer so much."" After reading the letter, Mr Conlon's sister, Ann McKernan said: ""Who could blame Gerry if he contemplated suicide, an innocent man who watched our innocent father die in a British prison? ""Gerry suffered so much with great dignity. I'm glad this letter has come to light because it shows that, even in the deepest despair, Gerry had a firm grip on the issues over his arrest."" Mr Lenihan's reply a month later tried to assure Mr Conlon of the support of the Irish government. He wrote: ""I understand the frustration which you now feel after 12 years of imprisonment. The widespread public sympathy for your predicament and support for your case, however, (may/can/should) be a source of encouragement for you."" The Guildford Four Five people died and more than 65 were injured in the Guildford explosions. When the Guildford Four were sentenced, trial judge Mr Justice Donaldson told them: ""If hanging were still an option, you would have been executed."" The Balcombe Street IRA unit admitted responsibility for the explosions in 1976, although no-one else was ever charged. After the BBC obtained papers at the National Archives under FOI, Mrs McKernan hired lawyers who said the documents showed ""possible alteration or suppression of evidence"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
High-rise flats approved for Bedminster shopping centre,"The revised proposal to transform St Catherine's Place in Bedminster, Bristol was approved on Thursday. The approved plans, which do not feature any affordable housing, include three tower blocks, the tallest of which is 14 storeys high. Initial plans were rejected following an appeal last month due to the adverse impact it would have on the local area. The majority of the 180 homes, comprising one and two bedroom apartments, will be based in the 14-storey tower block which will be built at the corner of Dalby Avenue and Stafford Street. The other residences will be located in a seven-storey high-rise at the bend of Dalby Avenue and a five-storey block on East Street. A small park and courtyard garden also feature in the approved design. An agent for Firmstone said the ""high quality urban regeneration scheme"" would ""revitalise"" St Catherine's Place shopping centre and make a ""huge difference"" to the local economy. However, some neighbours remained concerned about the high-rise build, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Seven residents who spoke against the proposal said it did not provide enough affordable housing or family homes, and the shadows cast by the tall buildings would harm the ""wellbeing and happiness"" of residents. In total the council received 59 objections to the revised plans from members of the public. A councillor also lodged an objection and 43 people wrote in support of the scheme. Bristol City Council has a 30 per cent affordable homes target for developments of more than 14 homes, but an independent assessment found it was not possible to guarantee any on the site at this time, according to an officer. Green councillor Stephen Clarke, who abstained from the vote, said: ""I'm desperate to support the shops in East Street, I can see them dying on their feet."" ""But I'm still very concerned about the height, scale and massing of the main block."" Some local business have supported the development. Simon Dicken, chair of the Bedminster Business Improvement District, said: ""I cannot overstate how much we need this development to turn around the fortunes of what at times can seem like a forgotten part of Bedminster."" It is understood the developer must review the provision of affordable housing twice during construction.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
ASA probes Home Office 'go home' van campaign,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it had started the inquiry into the Home Office's ""go home or face arrest"" vans following 60 complaints. The pilot scheme has faced criticism from the Liberal Democrats and Liberty. A Home Office spokesman said it was in contact with the ASA and would ""respond in due course"". The ASA said it had been ""flooded"" with calls in support of the scheme following its decision to investigate. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC Radio 5 live that the scheme would be rolled out nationally, ""if proved effective"". He said: ""Given Labour's open-door immigration policy, I don't see anything offensive as suggesting to illegal immigrants that their stay in this country might be shorter than they thought."" 'Misleading' claims The Home Office has said the pilot worked, but did not say how many people had left the country. Vans were driven around Barnet, Hounslow, Barking and Dagenham, Ealing, Brent and Redbridge as part of the campaign, which started on 22 July and lasted a week. In a statement, the ASA said the complainants - ""individual members of the public"" - had expressed concerns that the advert, in particular the phrase ""go home"", was offensive and irresponsible. It said complainants were concerned this was ""reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past and could incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multicultural communities"". ""Separately, some complainants have challenged whether the claim '106 arrests last week in your area' is misleading,"" the ASA added. ""They've also challenged whether it is misleading because it implies arrest is the automatic consequence of remaining in the UK without permission."" It added that one of the complainants was a former member of the ASA Council, Labour peer Lord Lipsey. 'National Front-style slogans' A Home Office spokesman said the 106 arrests referred to in the campaign were made across the six pilot boroughs between 30 June and 6 July. Labour's shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said: ""You've got to question the government's competence. We need effective action on immigration not offensive stunts."" Rachel Robinson, policy officer at human rights campaign group Liberty, said: ""Driving National Front-style slogans around ethnically-diverse areas was bound to cause deep offence."" Liberal Democrat business secretary Vince Cable has described the scheme as ""stupid and offensive"" and Brent Council leader Muhammed Butt said the project was ""an act of desperation"". Speaking on Radio 4, Lord Ouseley, a crossbench peer who is the former chief executive of the Commission for Racial Equality, said the advert was contributing to an ""element of racism and xenophobia"".

Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain,"But Glasgow is among the most vulnerable, the Centre for Cities study claimed. Its assessment looked at a range of factors including where declining government spending would hit hardest. The report also studied levels of employment, skills and private sector job creation in each city. Centre for Cities is a research and policy institute which seeks to improve the economic performance of UK cities. Its Cities Outlook 2011 index found that Aberdeen had the best growth prospects, followed by Bristol and Leeds. Glasgow rated above worst performers Sunderland and Merseyside because of its relatively strong skills base and the fact that its long term inequalities were diminishing. However, the report said the city's well known problems with welfare dependency left it vulnerable. The think tank said the weaker cities would require government support and a realistic plan of action, while the most promising cities should have more financial and political powers. The index placed Aberdeen second out of 63 cities for its employment. Aberdeen was also seen to have a high number of well-qualified residents and a good private business base. 'No surprise' Paul Swinney, of Centre for Cities, told BBC Scotland that Aberdeen was one of the least hard-hit cities in terms of recession. He said it would be ""insulated"" from the worst of public sector cuts, compared to other cities. Bob Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said ""We have long known that Aberdeen is one to watch. ""Our message is that providing the necessary support, which will help cities such as Aberdeen make an even bigger contribution to the country's economic recovery, will bring huge benefits to the whole country. ""We have a well-educated population here, we have a high employment rate, we are performing better than any other city in Scotland and if that pattern is to continue and improve we must have an infrastructure to support that."" And Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Future (Acsef) chairman Tom Smith said: ""These findings come as no surprise. The resilience of our local economy, largely due to our robust energy industry, is well recognised. ""It is, however, very welcome to receive national acknowledgement of our strong position.

Scotland's gone 'too far' on universal benefits says poverty advisor,"Naomi Eisenstadt told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme there should be more ""targeting"" of public money towards those who need it most. A independent report by Ms Eisenstadt, published earlier this week, urged the Scottish government to end the council tax freeze in 2017/2018. Ministers said they were committed to their universal benefits policies. Universal benefits include things like free prescriptions, free school meals and tuition fees. Speaking on the BBC Scotland programme, Oxford University research fellow Ms Eisenstadt, said: ""All universal benefits help everyone, not just the poorest. ""The difficulty is that there is a balance between the bureaucracy in administering means tested benefits, and sometimes the stigma associated, against how do you spend your money most effectively. ""I think we have gone too far in Scotland on the universal side and not far enough on the targeting. ""I think on the targeting we need to make the culture of public services more respectful and therefore avoid stigma that way."" Ms Eisenstadt, who was appointed by Ms Sturgeon in 2015 to provide advice on poverty and inequality, said she thought it was ""wrong"" that she got the winter fuel subsidy and that ""in times of austerity"" some pensioners had ""benefited enormously"". The Smith Commission has recommended control over the winter fuel payment, which currently rests with Westminster, is transferred to the Holyrood. The poverty advisor also reiterated her view that the council tax freeze ""does not help poor people"". She said: ""It does help better off people because housing hasn't been revalued for the last 25 years, so people living in the most expensive properties, where they have gone up in value, their taxes haven't changed."" ""The reason it's a disadvantage to poor people is that local authorities need the funding to fund services that mainly help the poorest people. ""I think that local authorities need more discretion over their spend and the way they get that discretion is by deciding for themselves what to charge for property tax."" Speaking at the launch of Ms Eisenstadt's report on Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed her findings and said the government would ""look at what we're doing well, and where we can improve"". Responding to the advisor's latest comments, a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We remain committed to our universal benefits policies such as free school meals, prescriptions and tuition fees to tackle inequalities. ""We welcome Naomi Eisenstadt's report and we will respond formally to it before the end of March, setting out how we intend to take forward its recommendations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Inverness Airport preferred site for air traffic hub,"Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the recommendation made in a study by consultants had been accepted in principal by its board. The project would be the first of its kind in the UK. Unmanned towers at the airports would feed information to the central hub at Inverness Airport. The towers would be located at Sumburgh in Shetland, Dundee, Wick John O'Groats, Kirkwall in Orkney, and Stornoway and Benbecula in the Western Isles. Prospect, a union representing workers involved in air traffic control, has criticised the choice of Inverness for the hub. It said the high quality jobs would be lost at the other airports. Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has raised similar concerns. 'Most compelling case' Hial said the centralised system would be phased in over a period of up to 10 years and that there were no planned reductions in staff numbers. The company, which is wholly owned by Scottish ministers, said air traffic control staff and unions, airport managers and senior personnel were involved throughout the process of identifying a location for the hub. The Scottish government and local politicians have also been kept informed, said Hial. Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: ""The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial's continued delivery of its core activities. ""We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required. Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective. ""Inverness is centrally located in relation to the other HIAL airports and has direct flights to Sumburgh, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula. It has road and rail connections with Dundee and Wick."" Hial's interim chair Lorna Jack said: ""We know that these changes will be challenging in those particular communities, but our overall aim is to future-proof the services that they depend on. ""We will now work with our colleagues and stakeholders to establish a centre of excellence that will deliver for the people and communities we serve."" Prospect negotiations officer, David Avery, said Hial's board had taken its decision without undertaking an assessment on the impact on local communities. He said: ""For our members this is far too late and it's clear that Hial intend to proceed regardless of what the report may tell them. ""Our members are highly skilled professional air traffic controllers who have significant operational and safety about the concept of remote towers and its implementation in Scotland.

Titanic Quarter bus lane tailbacks 'horrendous',"Motorists have complained of ""horrendous"" tailbacks on the Queen's and Sydenham roads following the introduction of a new bus lane. The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said delays had been ""greater than anticipated"" and it would revise traffic light timings in the area. The new road layout will accommodate Belfast's new Glider system. The Glider buses which will use the lanes have been described as ""a tram on wheels"" and will run approximately every seven to eight minutes, linking east Belfast, west Belfast and the Titanic Quarter with the city centre. However, on Thursday, Titanic Quarter commuters told BBC NI's Newsline programme the traffic problems are ""absolutely horrendous"". ""It's a bottleneck - hundreds and hundreds of cars,"" said one woman. Another told the programme: ""A usual journey for me would be 15, 20 minutes. It could be anything from 50 minutes to an hour now."" In a statement on Friday, DfI said it ""recognised the concerns of those caught up in traffic in Titanic Quarter and has made changes to try to alleviate the problem"". The statement requested patience from drivers, adding: ""Any change needs to be seen over a period of time to see what the impacts are on the traffic situation. ""At peak times, the road network in Belfast is at full capacity or over capacity. With new development the number of cars on our roads will continue to grow and this will make the situation worse if we do not act."" A spokesperson told the BBC that ""variable messaging signing"" had been added and changes had been made to traffic signalling in the area in an effort to improve the flow of traffic. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long said she believes the system needs to be temporarily suspended. ""Undoubtedly we need a rapid transport system... but this is not the solution. ""What we have here is gridlock, when a week ago we had free-flowing traffic,"" she told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. The East Belfast MLA said the congestion has created ""a very poor reflection on the Glider system before it has even started"". Mervyn Watley of Catalyst Inc said he and other businesspeople in the area are concerned that they may lose employees as a result of it. ""We're worried staff will just get fed up with this daily commute and look for other jobs,"" he said. ""Certainly Belfast needs a better transport system, but just looking at the queues, even if the buses were full every hour, we would still have congestion here."" Meanwhile, Translink and the Belfast Harbour Police both said they were working to improve traffic flow in the area.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Children in poverty in Wales falls to 23% after incomes drop,"The percentage of children from homes below the poverty line fell by 3% to 23% in the three years up to 2010/11, but it is above the UK average of 20%. Children are classed as being in relative poverty if they are from a household that lives on less than 60% of the median average income. The decline has been attributed to a drop in incomes across the board. The 23% figure - which represents about 100,000 children - does not take account of housing costs. The proportion of children in poverty after accounting for housing costs also fell after rising steadily during the last four years. It fell from 33% to 31% when new figures were published by the UK government on Thursday. The weekly income below which households are defined as being in poverty fell from £259 in 2009/10 to £251 last year as incomes fell across the population as a whole. Target The Welsh government has said it is committed to eradicating child poverty by 2020, although the Children's Commissioner recently expressed doubts about whether the target could be met. Plaid Cymru welcomed the figures, but said there was still a bigger chance that children would be living in poverty in Wales than in England or the UK as a whole. The party also warned of the impact of cuts to public spending. ""We are nowhere near reaching the benchmarks of halving child poverty by 2010 and ending it by 2020,"" said Plaid MP Hywel Williams. The Westminster coalition says factors such as drug addiction, homelessness and unemployment should be considered as well as income when defining child poverty. But Wales' deputy children's minister Gwenda Thomas said: ""Changing the definition of poverty is a distraction from the real need to tackle high levels of child poverty in Wales and the UK. ""The Welsh government remains fully committed to the measurement of poverty using a relative measure and to the aims of eradicating child poverty by 2020, to ameliorating the impacts of poverty, and to tackling the long term causes of poverty."" A Welsh government spokeswoman added that the figures were ""broadly welcome"". ""However, we remain cautious about some aspects of the figures. Levels of relative poverty can fall because of changes in middle incomes,"" she said. ""It will be important over the coming weeks to further analyse the reasons why these changes have occurred.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Glasgow's Burrell Collection becomes listed building,"Historic Scotland who made the award said it reflected the building's importance as an example of 1970s architecture. Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop called the building ""a masterpiece of structural design"". About 1% of Scotland's buildings are listed. The glass and brick building, which hosts the art collection of Sir William Burrell that he gifted to the care of Glasgow, is situated in the city's Pollok Park. The building opened in 1983 after a 13-year process to design and build a museum for more 8,000 paintings, pieces of furniture, and artistic objects collected by Burrell during his life. Cllr Archie Graham, chair of Glasgow Life which runs the museum, said: ""It says everything about the Burrell Collection building that is regarded so highly in its own right and is often named as one of Scotland's best. ""The A-listing from Historic Scotland allows us to celebrate this world famous building as proposals are brought forward for a refurbishment which will secure it for future generations."" Earlier this month trustees of the collection announced plans to upgrade and repair the 30-year-old building to make it fit for the 21st Century. 'Most impressive' Ms Hyslop said: ""The Burrell Collection is one of Glasgow and Scotland's most impressive buildings of its period and has contributed so much to our understanding of design thinking and the innovative use of interior and exterior space. ""The A-listing for the Burrell Collection is a fitting tribute especially in this its 30th year and recognises the significant contribution it has made to Glasgow's landscape and the aesthetic pleasure it has brought to many over the years."" Category A status is the highest level of architectural protection given to buildings, and makes up about 8% of 47,600 listings in Scotland. It is awarded to buildings which Historic Scotland determine have ""national or international importance, either architectural or historic"". Clare Price, conservation advisor with The Twentieth Century Society, said: ""We believe the Burrell Collection represents a unique contribution to twentieth century architecture in Scotland and to museum design internationally. ""The building's strength lies in its design: complementing the collection rather than competing with it, its sensitive palette of materials allowing it to blend with the landscape."" The collection attracts about 200,000 visitors each year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fly-tipping prosecutions fall by two-thirds in Scotland,"Responding to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, the Scottish government reported six successful prosecutions in 2017-18, compared with 18 in 2014-15. Campaign group Zero Waste Scotland described the fall as ""disappointing"". Council umbrella body Cosla said prosecution was just one of a range of sanctions that could be imposed. Zero Waste Scotland chief executive Iain Gulland said: ""The key to a successful litter prevention strategy is education, infrastructure and enforcement, so it's disappointing to see prosecutions decreasing, as they do form part of that mix. ""We have worked to prevent fly-tipping by working with partners to create tools to help tackle it."" Mr Gulland said those tools included the national Flymapper mobile phone app-based system, which allows councils to record fly-tipping incidents. He added: ""We are working to develop these tools further to provide more accessible and smart solutions for local authorities and other land managers to tackle litter and fly-tipping effectively."" Penalties for fly-tipping Those caught fly-tipping in Scotland are subject to a fixed penalty of £200. Penalties can be issued by the police, local authorities, and - since 1 April 2015 - by public bodies including Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. Someone convicted of fly-tipping can be fined up to £40,000. In addition, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and Revenue Scotland are able to recover landfill tax from illegally-deposited wastes. Source: Scottish government A spokesman for Cosla said all of Scotland's councils treated fly-tipping ""with the same degree of seriousness"". He added: ""The figures obtained in the FOI request refer only to cases referred to the procurator fiscal, so only give a partial view of the reality. ""Many councils address fly-tipping in the first instance in other and more cost-effective ways, such as fixed penalty notices, referral to community police or verbal and written warnings, with offenders required to remove and dispose of the waste lawfully."" Fly-tipping 'blight' A Scottish government spokeswoman said it had provided councils and Sepa with the powers to fine people who are caught fly-tipping. She added: ""Fly-tipping is illegal, dangerous and unnecessary. She added: ""Valuable resources which could be recycled are wasted and publicly-funded organisations and landowners bear the cost of cleaning up the blight that fly-tipping creates. ""Local authorities are primarily responsible for dealing with fly-tipping and the Scottish government has provided them and Sepa with the powers to fine people who are caught fly-tipping, with a minimum fixed penalty of £200 and up to a £40,000 fine if prosecuted.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Healthy breakfasts 'help pupils do well',"By Steffan MessengerBBC News It also found unhealthy food such as sweets had no positive effect. It is the first time a direct link between pupils' breakfast quality and consumption and their educational attainment has been demonstrated. The Cardiff University study asked 5,000 nine to 11-year-olds to list what they ate in 24 hours. The study involved more than 100 primary schools in Wales and built on research started 10 years ago. It found eating unhealthy items such as sweets and crisps for breakfast, reported by one in five children, had no positive impact on how they performed in tests. Pupils were asked to list all food and drink consumed over a period of just over 24 hours. Their results in Key Stage 2 teacher assessments were then followed up by researchers between six and 18 months later. The odds of achieving an above average performance was up to twice as high for pupils who ate breakfast, compared with those who did not. 'Concentration' Alongside the number of healthy breakfast items, other dietary behaviours - including number of sweets and crisps, and fruit and vegetable portions consumed throughout the rest of the day - were all significantly and positively associated with educational performance. Researchers claim the findings, published in the Public Health Nutrition journal, could have big implications for policymakers. Lead author Hannah Littlecott, from Cardiff University, said the odds of achieving above average performance were up to twice as high for pupils who ate a healthy breakfast than for those who did not. She said schools might see dedicating time towards improving health as an ""unwelcome diversion"" from teaching. But she added: ""Clearly, embedding health improvements into the core business of the school might also deliver educational improvements as well."" Co-author Dr Graham Moore said the data provided ""robust evidence of a link between eating breakfast and doing well at school"". In Wales, most primary schools offer a free school breakfast funded by the Welsh government. Kevin Davies, acting head of Ysgol y Wern Primary School in Ystalyfera, said it was obvious to teachers which pupils had not had a morning meal. ""By around 10am they start flagging. It has an effect on behaviour and concentration - some even fall asleep. ""So we have, in the past, taken them down to the kitchen to make sure they have something to keep them going until lunchtime."" ""It's clear to us that those who come to our breakfast club and have the balance of foods they need are more attentive and keen to complete their work and that persists throughout the day."" Public Health Wales welcomed the study's findings, saying they support the case for schools to consider measures to improve children's diets.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Parades Commission not going anywhere,"Mark DevenportPolitical editor, Northern Ireland@markdevenporton Twitter In the wake of the unedifying disturbances outside St Patrick's church in Belfast's Donegall Street, Mr Osborne has criticised the decision by leading unionists including Peter Robinson to put their names to an open letter which described his commission's decision to prevent a loyalist band from marching past the church as ""monstrous"". The letter to the Northern Ireland Office claimed the Secretary of State Owen Paterson had washed his hands in a ""Pontius Pilate"" way, ignoring the incompetence of the Commission. Once again it demanded the body's disbandment. Although parades remain the responsibility of direct rule ministers, the Stormont parties have been struggling to design a ""new and improved framework"" for marching ever since the Hillsborough agreement on justice in February 2010. A DUP-Sinn Fein working party set up then produced a draft bill in April 2010. It set out proposals for two new bodies, an office where people apply for permission to hold a parade or a protest, and an 11-strong adjudication body charged with deciding what happens in the event of a dispute. When Mr Osborne calls for the management of parades to be devolved, he isn't suggesting that MLAs should themselves make decisions about which marches can or can't go ahead. Instead he is arguing that they should take responsibility for setting up a new parades type commission, answerable to Stormont not the Northern Ireland Office. The problem with the April 2010 bill was that it didn't become law. The Orange Order rejected it after the DUP lost a tug of war within the Grand Orange Lodge with those who shared the doubts about the new structures voiced by both Traditional Unionist and Ulster Unionist politicians. The development of a new flashpoint at St Patrick's Church and the ensuing exchanges between unionists and nationalists, church leaders and the loyal orders makes the resolution of the running sores associated with parades more urgent. But as I wrote on 12 July, simply changing the name on the brass plate above a parading quango's door is no guarantee of success. Stormont returns next week. Whilst complaining about the secretary of state may provide an easy headline, the parties know any lasting solution will lie in local hands. Ordinarily MLAs would have a breathing space around now, with the marching season over, to revisit their proposals. But the fact that a march commemorating the Covenant is due to make its way past St Patrick's Church at the end of September complicates the situation. Peter Osborne could be continuing what he admits is the thankless task of adjudicating marching disputes for some time to come.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kanye West finally answers Jimmy Kimmel's Donald Trump question,"Kanye said he ""wasn't given a chance to answer"" when Kimmel asked why he thinks the president cares about black people. The rap star paused for several seconds before Kimmel cut to an ad break. He was asked again by a US radio station and after a 25-second pause, he replied: ""I feel that he cares about the way black people feel about him."" Kanye told 107.5 WGCI Chicago that Mr Trump knows he needs the support of black people. ""He would like for black people to like him like they did when he was cool in the rap songs and all this, and he will do the things that are necessary to make that happen because he's got an ego like all the rest of us."" Mr Trump has been referenced in rap songs by the likes of Kanye himself, Ludacris and Lil Wayne, mainly before he was US president, often referencing his wealth. Kanye added: ""He wants to be the greatest president and he knows that he can't be the greatest president without the acceptance of the black community so that's something he's going to work towards."" Kimmel commented on West's initial silence in an interview with The Daily Beast. ""I think Kanye is kind of in a perpetual state of being interviewed and he shares his thoughts constantly. So the idea that he needed to come up with the answer right there on the spot isn't necessarily something I agree with,"" said the late-night host. ""I felt that his silence answered the question in some ways."" During the radio interview, Kanye also spoke about his controversial comments in May suggesting that slavery ""sounds like a choice"" during an appearance on TMZ. ""I don't know if I properly apologised for how the slavery comment made people feel,"" he said. ""I'm sorry for the one-two effect of the MAGA [Make America Great Again] hat into the slave comment, and I'm sorry for people who felt let down by that moment."" West spoke directly to his fans: ""This is something about the fact that it hurt people's feelings and the way that I presented that piece of information. ""I could present in a way more calm way, but I was ramped up. And I apologise. That happens sometimes when people are... I'm not blaming mental health, but I'm explaining mental health.""

Lyra McKee: New footage released of suspected gunman,"The 29-year-old was hit by a bullet while observing a riot in the Creggan area in Londonderry. Det Supt Jason Murphy said he believed the man in the images to be in his late teens, relatively short in height and with a stocky build. The gunman is one of three men seen in the footage. He first appears on the left of the screen, walking with another masked man. In one of the images, the man appears to have a gun in his right hand. Earlier this week, the New IRA said its members had carried out the killing. A reward of up to £10,000 has been offered for information by the charity, Crimestoppers. On Friday, Det Supt Murphy appealed for anyone who recognises the men in the images to come forward and tell police. ""I believe the community has the information to help me unlock the key to Lyra McKee's murder,"" he said. ""I recognise people living in Creggan may feel it's difficult to come forward to speak to police. ""I want to provide a personal reassurance that we are able to deal with these concerns sensitively."" Analysis: Mark Simpson One week into the police investigation, detectives still have not recovered the weapon used in the attack. They are pleased that more than 140 people have provided them with information, but they need more. Forensic tests on the bullets fired suggest a weapon of similar calibre had been used in previous paramilitary-style attacks in the area. What detectives are doing now is piecing together the scientific and visual evidence, comparing it with witness statements, and seeing where it leads. The killing of Lyra McKee has kick-started Stormont talks which could potentially break the political deadlock. Police have their own job to do. And like the politicians, they have a long way to go. They are relying on the public for more information. Pictures of two other men, seen walking alongside the gunman shortly before the shooting, were also released. One is seen carrying a crate of petrol bombs, while the other is described as wearing dark skinny jeans, blue Nike trainers with a white tick and a white sole. He is also seen wearing a camouflage scarf or other covering across his face. Police say more than 140 people have provided images, footage and other details through the dedicated Major Incident Public Portal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Channel 4 breached Ofcom code with pre watershed X-Men,"The media watchdog highlighted six instances of violence which were ""unsuitable for children"". They included Wolverine growing talons and stabbing and killing a man. Channel 4 argued that the film has a 12A certificate and was ""carefully edited"" to reduce the level of violence. It listed 27 edits made to the film, and said the fourth feature film in the X-Men series was ""scheduled with care to avoid programmes specifically made for children"". ""Intense"" surgery The broadcaster also pointed out that the film, starring Hugh Jackman, which was shown on Sunday 26 August at 18:55 GMT, had been aired previously pre-watershed on Channel 4, and had not attracted any complaints. However, following up on a viewer complaint, Ofcom found various scenes of violence in breach of its guidelines. These included an ""intense"" scene involving a surgical procedure in which Wolverine's head and body are drilled with holes and two violent fights between Wolverine and his brother during which stab wounds are shown. Ofcom said while it took into account that Channel 4 had ""clearly taken measures to ensure the fantasy violence was toned down"", it said some edits were ""insufficient to address the ongoing violent themes throughout the film"". It said that almost 12% of the audience was aged 4-15 and viewers, particularly parents, would not have expected a film with such levels of intense violence to be shown at that time on a Sunday evening. ""Aggression and menace"" Ofcom also said that viewers had not been sufficiently warned about the nature of the content when the film was introduced as: ""Film fantasy action now on 4. Hugh Jackman seeks revenge as the troubled superhero Wolverine. X-Men Origins."" ""In Ofcom's opinion, this announcement did not make sufficiently clear that the film would have a dark and violent theme and scenes of violence, aggression and menace throughout,"" said the media watchdog. ""We also noted that Channel 4 has recently shown films which have a wide family appeal such as Inkheart, Ice Age: The Meltdown, Hairspray and The Golden Compass in similar time slots (although scheduled up to an hour earlier than 18:55)."" Ofcom found Channel 4 in breach of rule 1.3 of the broadcasting code, which states children must be protected by appropriate scheduling from material that is unsuitable for them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Concert marks 40 years since the Rolling Stones 'nearly' rocked Pembroke,"The gig was to take place in front of 12,000 fans but the old borough council refused permission for it to go ahead. Health and safety fears were blamed but fans back in September 1973 thought councillors were ""old fogeys"". Now a tribute concert aims to make up for lost time. Organisers said the anniversary concert by a tribute band would be a chance to see what had been missed. ""Pembroke Castle had hosted Hot Chocolate and other venues had regularly hosted chart acts, but nobody had at that stage had anyone near the Stones,"" said Malcolm Cawley - DJ BB Skone - who was 24 at the time. The Rolling Stones were organising an European tour and had been offered the chance to fill a gap in September. Word quickly spread as the promoters advertised the event, even in the national press. Permission had not been granted by the local council however as Ann Dureau, who was a councillor in her 30s on Pembrokeshire Borough Council at the time, recalled: ""The response was utter horror. The councillors said it would mean closing the whole of the main street and shop windows would have to be battened down. ""They were saying things like 'we'll be inundated by hippies and wild people'. ""There was a meeting and it was thumbs down completely when it came to the vote, although I voted for it. ""Young people couldn't believe that we'd lost such an opportunity and in retrospect it was a bold plan and it was a pity we didn't grab a chance to see what would happen."" Jon Williams, the current Pembroke Castle manager, said health and safety had been the main issue behind the council's refusal to grant permission but there had been other issues too. ""I think the promoter came to Pembroke Town Council very late in the day, about a month before the concert was due,"" he said. ""The council called an extraordinary meeting to discuss it and in the interim the promoter went on to promote the concert so by the time it go to the meeting I think the council's nose was out of joint a little bit."" Due to current regulations the castle can only accommodate 2,700 for the anniversary gig where Rolling Stone tribute band the Counterfeit Stones will headline. The band knew all about the cancelled gig in 1973 and singer Steve Elson - aka Nick Dagger - said: ""It's a beautiful place and it would probably have been one of their most memorable gigs from that period.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"University merger 'conspiracy', says Dr Peter Noyes","By Jordan DaviesBBC News Dr Peter Noyes says new finance arrangements by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (Hefcw) means 20% fewer students next year. Hefcw says universities will receive more income in the new arrangements. But Dr Noyes believes this is a move to force the merging of some universities in south east Wales. ""It is difficult to not come to the conclusion that there is some conspiracy against the university here in Newport and trying to force us into a merged situation with two other institutions,"" he told BBC Wales. He said the Hefcw had not offered any explanation why they are offering fewer places in the area. ""You have to try and then extrapolate from that and work out what are the reasons they might have. ""And the big one that I think is extant is the fact that they are trying to push the merger of the institutions in south east Wales."" Tuition fees He wants to see a new institution because the ""notion of bolting together three institutions lacks vision"". Last November, the Welsh government announced its desire to create a new ""super university"" in south east Wales, combining the University of Wales Newport, Glamorgan University and Cardiff Metropolitan University. The board of governors at Cardiff Metropolitan University have already said they are opposed to any new enlarged institution and say they are prepared to fight the move in the courts. Dr Noyes says his focus is on reversing the decision to fund fewer places before entering talks over wider changes. The Hefcw has allocated undergraduate places based on a new formula which has left Newport University with 311 fewer students next year. Aberystwyth University could potentially lose over 500 places, but will generate income through charging the maximum £9,000 in tuition fees. Hefcw says each university will receive more income overall for full-time undergraduate and PGCE students by 2014/15 than it would have done had the old funding system been projected forwards. In a statement, Hefcw added that following its advice in the summer of 2011 about the future structure of higher education, the education minister accepted the recommendation for the development of a ""strong, competitive"" university from the pre-1992 former polytechnics in south east Wales. ""In the light of the Welsh government's ongoing discussions with the institutions concerned, we do not believe it is appropriate for Hefcw to discuss reconfiguration in south-east Wales at this time."" The Welsh government says the re-allocation of student numbers is a matter for Hefcw, but that it believes the proposals are ""sensible and proportionate"". A spokesperson added: ""It is important to note that even with the re-allocation of student numbers every higher education institute in Wales will still be better off under the new fee regime than they would have been under the old funding system. ""This has been achieved against a backdrop of funding cuts to Wales in the UK Government's last spending review.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
CBI says leaving EU would have serious consequences for Britain,"In its latest report on the subject, the CBI accepts there are problems with EU membership but that these are greatly outweighed by the benefits. It says most of its members want to stay within the 28-country bloc. Those on the other side of the hotly contested issue say the UK would be better served through a more distant relationship with the EU. The CBI's report says the plan for a referendum on membership by 2017 means it is that essential business becomes involved in the debate. ""Just as 'more Europe' isn't the answer to every question, neither is 'no Europe',"" the report says. ""Being a member of the European Union helps British businesses to grow and create more jobs across the UK."" It says membership gives UK businesses access to more than 500 million customers within the single market, and the EU's size allows its trade negotiators go 'toe-to-toe' with global giants like the US and China to open up their markets. Helpful The CBI also says membership is good for households. It says that if membership is worth about 4-5% of national income, this would mean £3,000 for each household on average. However, the lobby group points to areas where renegotiation would be helpful, in particular on issues such as regulation of smaller firms. Will Straw, the executive director of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, commented: ""The CBI report blows a huge hole in the out campaign's argument. Being part of Europe boosts the UK economy by increasing our trade and investment in turn supporting millions of jobs here at home. ""We already have the best of both worlds, trading within the EU and other countries. Why would we put that at risk?"" Who are the groups campaigning to leave the EU? Vote Leave comprises a cross-party group of MPs and peers from the Conservatives and Labour, and UKIP's only MP Douglas Carswell. It is being run by Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group founder Matthew Elliot, who organised the successful 'No2AV' campaign in the referendum on Westminster's voting system, and Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove. It has the backing of three existing Eurosceptic groups: Conservatives for Britain; Labour Leave and Business for Britain, and is being funded by party donors. Leave.EU was formerly called The Know and rebranded when an amended referendum question was proposed. Founded by UKIP donor Arron Banks, it has been described by UKIP leader Nigel Farage as an ""umbrella group"" of anti-EU campaigners.

Honduras protests: Buildings burn during clashes over reforms,"Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from a number of buildings in the city after they were set alight. The protesters fear that the reforms could lead to mass lay-offs of teachers and doctors. They have been on strike since Congress approved the reforms. Demonstrations were also held outside the capital. What happened? A largely peaceful march against the reforms turned violent when a small group of hooded protesters clashed with riot police in the historic city centre of Tegucigalpa. At least four buildings were set alight, among them Tegucigalpa's city hall. Shop fronts were smashed and burning barricades erected to block key roads. Demonstrators also occupied the campus of the National Autonomous University in Tegucigalpa. Riot police fired tear gas and charged at demonstrators with batons. Dozens of people were injured in the clashes and one of them is in a serious condition. Police evacuated more than 250 people from the city hall after it was set alight by demonstrators throwing petrol bombs. Outside the capital, a woman gave birth in a crowd in the town of La Ceiba after being caught up in protests. What are the protesters' demands? The demonstrators want to stop two bills from coming into force which aim to restructure the ministries of education and health. The bills were passed on 25 April by the Honduran Congress in a tense sitting which saw some rival lawmakers push and shove each other. They still require one more voting session to become law. Doctors and teachers have gone on strike in protest at the proposed reform, which they say will lead to mass sackings in the public sector. They say that the restructuring is the first step towards the privatisation of education and health services. The government denies that the reform will lead to privatisation and layoffs. It says that the restructuring will provide savings of more than $300m (£231m) which it plans to invest in primary education, the construction of two hospitals and the improvement of neonatal care. What's the political background? Backers of the reform say the opposition Libre party is stoking opposition to the law for political purposes. The bills have the backing of conservative President Juan Orlando Hernández. During the protests, many of the demonstrators also demanded the resignation of President Hernández, who won a second term in 2017 in a disputed election in which his party was accused of fraud.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Duterte pulls police off controversial drugs crackdown,"The country's Drugs Enforcement Agency will take charge of operations instead. Police say they have killed over 3,850 people in anti-drugs operations since Mr Duterte took office last year. In January, he also suspended police from the war on drugs, calling them ""corrupt"" - but reinstated them again shortly afterwards. That suspension came after a South Korean businessman was kidnapped and killed by anti-drug police. The woman who kills drug dealers for a living Mr Duterte was elected last summer on a hardline platform promising to fight drugs, crime and corruption. His policy of endorsing extrajudicial killings in the war against drugs has drawn widespread international condemnation and also led to criticism within the country. In September, thousands attended rallies criticising his war on drugs - although thousands of others attended rival pro-Duterte rallies. Changing mood music Analysis by the BBC's Howard Johnson in Manila What we're seeing at the moment is an attempt by the government to restructure its war on drugs. A summer of bad headlines, notably the killing of three teenagers by the Philippine National Police (PNP) force, sparked street protests and condemnation from the Catholic Church. Over the last month the killings of drug suspects have seemingly slowed down while the PNP has launched a community drug rehabilitation programme. The mood music is also changing. The PNP said last week of the 6,225 drug-related deaths during its operations not one of them was an extra-judicial killing, while the president's long-term partner, Cielito ""Honeylet"" Avanceñahas, said she believed he would never order the police to kill drug addicts. It's all a far cry from the early days of President Duterte's term in office when he said: ""There's three million drug addicts. I'd be happy to slaughter them."" The most high-profile controversy this summer involved a boy killed in Caloocan on 16 August. Police said the 17-year old ran from them and then opened fire, so they shot him. Yet his parents denied he had any involvement in drugs. A witness said police tried to force a gun into his hand and CCTV footage shows a boy, said to be him, being dragged away by police, contradicting claims he ran. As a consequence, the police said 1,200 officers from the capital Manila would be retrained and then assigned to other units. While Mr Duterte still enjoys widespread support, a fresh poll this weekend showed trust and satisfaction in the president drop to the lowest levels since the start of his term. On Thursday, relatives of two people killed by police filed a case in the country's supreme court calling for the drug war to be declared illegal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The Men Who Own Scotland: Land reform on 'radical journey',"By David MillerBBC Scotland environment correspondent Paul Wheelhouse told BBC Scotland he believes the country needs a fairer distribution of land. He said the Scottish Parliament was ""on a journey"" towards radical reform. He said: ""I doubt anyone would design a system where you ended up with only 432 people owning half the private land."" He added: ""I wouldn't design a system where you ended up with such a concentration of wealth and ownership in such a small group."" But major landowners have defended their record, arguing their contribution to the economy of rural Scotland is ignored by politically-motivated land reform campaigners. Douglas McAdam, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, said: ""A recent survey of a cross section of our membership revealed their combined investment plans in rural development projects are in excess of £820m. Our very conservative estimate is that across the membership, that figure would be well in excess of £1bn. ""We will continue to put forward progressive proposals to government on land reform that will make a difference to Scottish rural life, rather than focus on out-of-date arguments."" The issue of land reform in Scotland is explored in a television documentary to be broadcast on BBC1 Scotland on Wednesday night. John Mackenzie, from Gairloch, owns 53,000 acres in the Highlands. In the programme he is asked whether he believes the concentration of land ownership in Scotland is ""fair"". He replied: ""It may not be fair, but is it fair that your wife may be prettier than mine? That you win the lottery when I don't? It's a concern stirred up, as far as I can see by those with axes to grind."" Another big landowner warns that any move to break up sporting estates would threaten the rural economy which, he says, relies on landowners with ""deep pockets"". Community aspirations Christopher Moran, of the Cabrach and Glenfiddich Estate, told the programme: ""The sort of investment that's necessary to bring about sustainable regeneration is substantial. ""If you end up splitting up estates like this, where is that type of investment going to come from?"" But Paul Wheelhouse has insisted change is needed. He is due to receive a report from the Scottish government's Land Reform Review Group in April. ""My party genuinely believes that there should be a fair distribution of land,"" he said. ""Communities should have access to land to fulfil their aspirations."" He added: ""I think if we don't see a fairer distribution of land, then we in parliament will have failed the people of Scotland.""

Motorway lessons proposed for learner drivers,"Lessons would be in a dual-control car with an approved instructor - currently drivers can only go on motorways once they have passed their practical exam. Other plans include a crackdown on dangerous drivers, by providing police forces with more money for enforcement. The proposals will be put out to consultation next year. There will be a £2m research project into how to improve motoring education for learner and novice drivers. As part of a wide-ranging strategy document - some of which applies to the whole of Britain and some to certain nations only - the Department for Transport also proposes: At present, fewer than half of learners pass their practical test first time - a statistic the government says it wants to improve. ""We will encourage a higher percentage of learner drivers to aim to pass their driving test the first time around, when they are truly ready for independent driving,"" the document states. ""In doing so, we will consider whether more should be done to support and reward a broader range of driving experiences, such as night driving and motorways, ahead of candidates obtaining their driving licence and whether restructuring the costs of the driving test would incentivise learners to undertake more pre-test practice."" 'No time for parents' Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the announcement of motorway lessons. He said: ""Mile-for-mile, motorways are our safest roads but can be intimidating places for novice drivers. ""The important thing is the official seal of approval provided by the approved driving instructor who will accompany them down the slip-road. ""This is definitely not the time to have mum or dad in the passenger seat."" Neil Greig, director of policy and research at the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ""Logistically, motorway driving can never be compulsory but for the many who live close to them, this offers a step change in their confidence and safety in our most important economic routes."" The strategy also sets out plans to give £750,000 to police forces in England and Wales to improve their ability to identify and prosecute drug-drivers. 'Hidden killer' AA president Edmund King said drug driving was ""the hidden killer"" and extra efforts to tackle it were ""welcome and overdue"". Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said Britain's roads were some of the safest in the world, but more could be done to improve them. ""We are delivering common-sense proposals that balance tougher penalties for dangerous drivers with practical steps to help youngsters and other more vulnerable groups stay safe on our roads."" Northern Ireland is responsible for its own road traffic legislation, including driver and vehicle testing, road safety policy and vehicle standards.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dalian Atkinson: Ex-footballer 'staggered' towards accused PC,"PC Benjamin Monk is charged with murdering the 48-year-old after the exchange in Shropshire in 2016. Witnesses said they saw him and co-accused PC Mary-Ellen Bettley Smith run away from Mr Atkinson ""as fast as they could"" on the night of 15 August. Both officers from West Mercia Police deny any wrongdoing. On the fifth day of their trial at Birmingham Crown Court, jurors heard from David Lewis, a resident of Meadow Close, Telford, where Mr Atkinson had arrived to visit his father at about 01:30 BST. He described the former Villa striker's mood as ""very unstable"" before PCs Monk and Bettley-Smith arrived, and recalled him kicking at his father's door. When the officers appeared, Mr Atkinson ""started to walk towards them,"" Mr Lewis said. ""When they got to the end of the driveway, they ran down the road as if they were frightened of something. ""Dalian suddenly started to almost run - he suddenly changed his pace of walking."" Although Mr Lewis did not see PC Monk discharge his Taser, he saw Mr Atkinson fall and a female officer raising a baton above her head and bringing it down twice. The court previously heard how data from PC Monk's Taser revealed how after two failed discharges, it had been deployed for more than 30 seconds - six times longer than is standard. Imprints of the officer's bootlaces were also found on Mr Atkinson's head from where he had been kicked. Mr Atkinson died at about 02:45 that morning. The court heard previously that the sportsman had a number of underlying health conditions but pathologists agreed he would have survived ""were it not for the third Taser deployment and the kicks to his head"". Jurors were also read a written statement from Mr Lewis' late wife, Janet. She recounted in her testimony seeing PC Monk appear to kick Mr Atkinson in a way ""similar to a footballer kicking a football with substantial force"". Her statement also said how ""even with my window closed I could hear the strikes administered with her [PC Bettley-Smith's] baton impacting on Dalian's body and clothing"". One of the first two police officers to arrive after Mr Atkinson was tasered told the court he heard PC Monk tell paramedics the ex-footballer ""may be a bit bloody as I had to kick him"". Defence QC Patrick Gibbs asked Pc Mark Bedford, who no longer works for the force, if the comment by PC Monk about the former striker being kicked to the head would have been useful information for paramedics to know. He answered: ""I would presume so. They would need to know the injuries he had got."" PC Monk, 42, denies murder and manslaughter. PC Bettley-Smith, 31, denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

New marine zone plans scrapped by minister,"Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. 'Strongly held views' The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Devon and Cornwall police officers tasked with call centre work,"By Simon HallCorrespondent, BBC South West About 50 officers have been diverted to process reports of crimes filed on the internet and by email. The force said ""the significant majority were on restricted duties"". Jan Goffey, mayor of Okehampton which has lost patrol officers to call centre work, said it was a ""very expensive way of doing filing work"". She said: ""It would be far better if they were doing the job they were trained to do which is help the public out on the streets."" More on how officers are being taken off patrol, plus more Devon and Cornwall news Roy Smith, whose fast food shop in the town had its window smashed, said: ""It seems a bit stupid. ""I know the police are underfunded and undermanned anyway, but when you've got things like this happening there should be some sort of presence in the town."" Former police and crime commissioner Tony Hogg said earlier this year the 101 service was currently not fit for purpose and had got worse. 'Operational risks' Devon and Cornwall Police has since encouraged people to use email or an online form to report crimes to cut delays calling the 101 non-urgent number. In a statement, bosses said: ""In response to the 101 delays, the force moved around 50 people including officers, PCSOs and other staff to assist the contact centre. ""The significant majority of these were on restricted duties therefore were unable to undertake front-line duties or their usual job role. ""The team have been recording crime information, to release our call handlers to answer 101 and 999 calls. ""This is a short term position and we expect all the staff to be returned to their original roles by Christmas."" Andrew White, chief executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, said he was ""delighted"" at the police's move because the 101 service had been ""unacceptable for too long"". He said: ""The delays that we had in getting crimes input to the system put the force at an operational risk. ""Important information was not being shared as soon as it should had been this risks offenders remaining at large and victims not being properly protected.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It comes after H&T revealed that the City watchdog was reviewing the short term cash loans it offered and could ask it to pay compensation. Boss John Nichols said the firm would work with regulators but that its cash-strapped customers would be affected. It has stopped offering short term cash loans while the review is carried out. Mr Nichols said he hoped these cash loans, which are separate to pawnbroking and typically amounted to about £500, would be available again from January. He admitted that the timing was a concern for the business, with pre-Christmas a busy time for giving short-term loans, and had come ""a bit out of the blue"" from the regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ""The unintended consequence is that people could go to unregulated lenders,"" he said. Regulation of short-term, high-interest cash loans has had a significant impact on the credit industry in recent years - particularly among big payday lenders, some of which have collapsed. Regulators have introduced stricter rules on ensuring that loans should only be given to those who can afford to repay. The company is working with the FCA to review its affordability checks for loans over the last six years, which Mr Nichols suggested had previously been given a clean bill of health. They relate to cash loans, sold from H&T stores, which typically required repayment within six to 12 months. Such loans would have relatively high interest, as they were available to people who might struggle to be accepted for a loan from the bank. Over the past six years the company said total customer interest payments were £24m. The review will consider whether any compensation should be paid. It said: ""Should any redress be payable, H&T anticipates being able to fund this from its existing financial resources."" Although the company said this area of its business only accounted for 4% of revenues, its shares fell by 25% in early trading before recovering later in the morning. Pawnbroking unaffected The pawnbroking arm of the business, one of the biggest in the UK, is unaffected. This will be a relief to some customers who were shifted over from rival Albemarle & Bond (A&B) when the latter collapsed in early September. Many were taken by surprise when A&B abruptly ceased trading, blaming ""significant"" financial losses. Some even feared goods such as jewellery and gold would never be returned. But H&T agreed to buy £8m worth of loans linked to customers' belongings - known as ""pledge books"" - from Speedloan Finance, which had traded under the name Albemarle & Bond. The deal meant customers of A&B could redeem or extend their existing loans at H&T's 248 UK pawn shops.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vauxhall: Crunch talks to save Ellesmere Port plant continue,"By Simon JackBusiness editor A board meeting of Vauxhall's parent company ended without agreement on its fate, although an announcement is expected within 48 hours. More than 1,000 people work at the site - with many more in the supply chain. The business secretary has met the management of parent company Stellantis three times in the last six weeks. The most recent meeting took place on Monday night, with talks involving government officials along with company management and representatives of the local authority. ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we're doing all we can to protect and create jobs, while securing a competitive future for the sector,"" a government spokesperson said. The BBC understands that there are three main options on the table for the Cheshire plant: While number three is obviously the outcome the government and unions would prefer, it requires confidence that the UK will be able to build the necessary battery production facilities to service this and other UK car plants. Currently, the only viable battery plant is in the North East, which works exclusively with its former owner Nissan. Under the terms of the Brexit trade deal, it is possible for batteries made in the European Union (EU) to be installed in UK-assembled vehicles for export back to the EU (where most are sold). But industry experts say the economics don't make sense as the batteries are heavy and hard to transport as they are not currently permitted through the Channel Tunnel for safety reasons. Doubts about the long-term future of the factory intensified after recent comments from the chief executive of the parent company Stellantis - the new name for the merged PSA and Fiat Chrysler. Carlos Tavares referred to the ""brutal"" decision for the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the EU. Government officials are aware that the future of car production in the UK depends on a rapid scaling up of battery production and it is widely hoped Chancellor Rishi Sunak will address the issue in his Budget speech next Wednesday, which is coincidentally the same day that Stellantis announce their annual results and operating review.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chinese investment in the US falls sharply in 2017,"The value of deals announced in 2017 fell by more than 90% from the year before, according to joint studies by the National Committee on US-China Relations and the Rhodium Group. The reports said policy shifts in both countries triggered the decline. China has curbed outbound investments, while the US is raising concerns about deals for national security reasons. ""This altered policy environment has already changed patterns of two-way [foreign direct investment] and will continue to reshape investment levels and composition in the future,"" the authors of the reports say. Chinese firms completed $29bn (£20.5bn) worth of investments in the US last year, down 35% from the record $46bn completed in 2016, the report found. But the 2017 figure was ""propped up significantly"" by deals carried over from the previous year, according to the study. If transactions announced prior to 2017 are not included, the value of completed deals fell by 74%. Chinese investment The decline followed a rapid increase in Chinese investment overseas over the last decade, which has fuelled worries both in China and in countries including the US, Australia and Germany. In late 2016, China's regulators moved to curb outbound investment, concerned in part by debt-fuelled acquisitions in other countries. That was followed by a crackdown on some of the countries biggest conglomerates. In the US, politicians have voiced concerns that Chinese companies, backed by the government, are targeting investments at military and security-related technologies. Last year, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which reviews transactions for national security risk, blocked almost $10bn worth of deals, including the sale of US semiconductor and aluminium companies, the report estimated. And this year several high-profile attempts at Chinese investment have been blocked - including the sale of money transfer firm Moneygram to China's Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba. US President Donald Trump has also asked his staff to identify new ways to limit Chinese investment in the US, part of a broader response to alleged theft of intellectual property that also includes plans for tariffs on $50bn worth of Chinese imports. The US Congress is also working on legislation that would give the federal government more power to review business deals for national security risks. The report on Chinese investment said that how far the US decides to go will have ""major consequences"" for future investment. About 140,000 people in the US are now employed by a firm that is majority owned by a Chinese company, many of them in sectors such as real estate, hospitality and entertainment, according to the report. Last year's investments, the vast majority by privately-owned firms, included a stake in Snapchat, the purchase of a business that leases commercial aircraft and acquisition of a portfolio of commercial property. As well as discouraging investments by the Chinese, US firms, which invested about $14bn in China last year, could become more hesitant to do business in China, the report added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Venezuela elections neither 'free nor fair', says US","The State Department said ballot papers had been manipulated and polling stations moved ""without public notice"". President Nicolás Maduro's supporters won 17 of 23 state governorships but opposition leaders have alleged fraud. The opposition Democratic Union Roundtable coalition has refused to recognise the result. Venezuela socialists win governor seats amid fraud claims ""We condemn the lack of free and fair elections yesterday in Venezuela. The voice of the Venezuelan people was not heard,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. She alleged there had been ""last-minute changes to polling station locations without public notice; manipulation of ballot layouts; and limited availability of voting machines in opposition neighbourhoods"". The statement also criticised a ""lack of independent, credible international observers"" and demanded a ""technical audit for the National Electoral Council's tabulation"". The National Electoral Council announced the election results and has been accused of pro-government bias by the opposition. President Maduro hailed the landslide as a victory for Chavismo, his party's brand of socialism named after former President Hugo Chávez. He said it was proof that Venezuela has ""the best electoral system in the world"". Conflict with Washington Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas The opposition in Venezuela was never likely to recognise an election that handed President Maduro such a wide margin of victory. Now their concerns have been echoed by the Trump Administration. The US has already imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan government and further action may now follow. None of this will come as a surprise to President Maduro. He generally thrives off the conflict with Washington and the EU. In the short term, he's simply pleased to have announced to the nation a significant victory at the polls, whether people believe the result or not. His government will now press ahead with the process of having the new governors swear in before the controversial new legislative body, the constituent assembly. The State Department described Mr Maduro's government as an ""authoritarian dictatorship"" and pledged ""the full weight of American economic and diplomatic power"" to ""the Venezuelan people as they seek to restore their democracy"". The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called for an audit of the electoral process. ""An election is only legitimate if it is free and fair, and from the start, this was neither,"" she said. A poll conducted by private firm Datanalisis before the election suggested 45% of voters intended to vote for opposition candidates and 21% for the governing socialist party candidates. However, another poll by the same firm had also suggested that President Maduro's popularity rose by six percentage points after the US imposed sanctions on him.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Edwin Poots: Arlene Foster's exit is 'rough and tumble' of politics,"In an interview with BBC News NI, Mr Poots said sometimes ""people are on the wrong side of it"". Mrs Foster announced her resignation as DUP leader and first minister last month after an internal party revolt. ""That is how politics is and we do not get involved in discussing internal affairs of the DUP in a public way,"" Mr Poots said. Mr Poots said he ""would assume at some stage it may well happen to me"". ""Politics is a rough and tumble game and sometimes people are on the wrong side of it,"" Mr Poots said. Mr Poots said he had spoken to Mrs Foster and would speak on a one-to-one basis ""in due course"". Mrs Foster is due to step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June. In an interview with the Sunday Life, Mr Poots indicated he will consult with the party about whether Arlene Foster should stand down as first minister earlier than her intended departure date. The DUP leader-designate said he wanted to split the DUP leader and first minister roles because he believes there is a ""real piece of work"" to do in building the party and he wants to give his attention to that. But he added: ""We will see in due course. But I move forward with the commitment that I wasn't going forward as first minister... if in the future members think it would work better with me as first minister, then we will have that discussion. But for this time, I don't have any interest or intent to do that."" Mr Poots also signalled he has no intention of collapsing Stormont over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border in the Irish Sea. He said Stormont is an asset in making the arguments against the protocol. ""It gives us authority to make arguments. It takes us right to the centre of government in the United Kingdom and I have made these arguments."" He said the arguments would be put forward forcibly and that legally, every course that can be taken to tackle the protocol will be taken. ""We will take every reasonable exercise that we can to ensure that we can inflict damage to the protocol,"" he said. Mr Poots has said he is keen to ensure a smooth transition when Mrs Foster steps down. He has been holding individual meetings with DUP assembly members, seeking their views before beginning any shake-up. His plans are thought to include changing the ministerial team, as well as the DUP chairs and vice-chairs of Stormont's committees.

Sky updates porn filter after row over blocking,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The filters are intended to allow parents to ensure children cannot view adult content. But the automatic blocking of all file-sharing sites meant that news site TorrentFreak and other legitimate sites were also blocked. Following publicity, Sky said that it had decided to tweak its filters to unblock the file-sharing news site. ""The categorisation of torrentfreak.com has now been updated so that the site will no longer be filtered by Sky Broadband Shield,"" the firm told the BBC. ""If at any time a website owner believes they have been unfairly filtered or miscategorised by Sky Broadband Shield, they can contact Sky and we will look into it as soon as we can,"" it added. TorrentFreak editor-in-chief Ernesto van der Dar welcomed the change of heart. Earlier he told the BBC that he was angry about the block. ""The problem with these filters is that they block many sites that are perfectly suitable for all audiences, simply because they are labelled a file-sharing site,"" he said. He said that Sky had originally told him that the site would remain blocked. A BBC investigation last year found that porn filters from other UK ISPs were blocking access to sex education and rape-victim support websites. Default censor Following pressure from the UK government, several of the UK's biggest ISPs have implemented new ways of blocking pornography. Prime Minister David Cameron had said that the ISPs needed to act to prevent children from ""stumbling across hardcore legal pornography"". Sky rolled out its filters in November. New subscribers have to opt out of its Broadband Shield default setting if they want to see adult content. In December BT announced its version, which is automatically set to be on for new customers Critics argue that the porn filters used are too sweeping and end up blocking too many legitimate sites. ""We are starting to see sites blocked which should not be,"" said Sebastien Lahtinen, founder of broadband news site ThinkBroadband. ""When the default position is to filter, a potentially high number of users might not be able to access a filtered site, acting as a form of default censor,"" he added. He said that it was relatively easy to side-step filters for anyone determined to do so. ""As soon as I type the filter name into Google it suggests the search term 'bypass'. The second result is a YouTube video of what sounds like a kid explaining how to work around it,"" he told the BBC. ""The key message needs to be that these are a tool to help parents not a replacement for appropriate education and supervision,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NHS Highland's management criticised for keeping members in the dark,"The criticism from MSP Hugh Henry came during a meeting of Holyrood's public audit committee on Wednesday. He attacked the way management held some of its discussions on arrangements for a £2.5m Scottish government loan. MSP Mary Scanlon was also critical. NHS Highland's chairman Garry Coutts said the criticism was ""disappointing"". He said staff and the senior management team were ""always open and accessible"" to board members. NHS Highland is facing a deficit of more than £12m to the end of the financial year. It has said it expects to break even. The £2.5m loan was secured to balance its books last year. Mr Henry criticised the way senior management had handled some of the discussions on the loan. He said talks were held informally, which meant there was not a record of them available for public scrutiny. The public audit committee convenor said: ""These senior officers are actually treating the board like mushrooms - they are best kept in the dark."" 'Open and accessible' NHS Highland's chief executive Elaine Mead and finance director Nick Kenton are to be called to explain to the committee the state of the health board's finances. In a statement, Mr Coutts said: ""I have been disappointed at some of the criticisms levelled at us and wish to outline exactly what happened with regard to brokerage."" He said the funding from the Scottish government was agreed on 6 March this year and was public information on 25 March. There were media reports on the agreement on 26 March. Mr Coutts said: ""Our staff and senior management team are always open and accessible to board members, local and national politicians, members of the public and the media. ""We have regular meetings with MSPs throughout the year, at which we answer any questions they may have. We welcome the opportunity to speak to the Scottish Parliament's public audit committee and to offer further reassurance."" Last month, Scotland's financial watchdog flagged up concerns about the accounts of NHS Highland. In a report laid before the Scottish Parliament, Audit Scotland highlighted weaknesses in the financial management of the health board during 2013/14. These weaknesses were a major factor in the board requiring brokerage of £2.5m from the Scottish government to break even. This was mainly due to overspend and weaknesses in financial management at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Other factors were increased spending on agency and locum staff, and meeting national waiting time targets.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Minister 'abducted' entrepreneur,"Munsiri Kankanamge Indika Dilruk Hemantha accused a close ally of President Mahinda Rajapaksa of threatening, abducting and trying to kill him. Hemantha who has bought the luxury vehicle from leader of the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) party, Ellawala Medhananda thero, said he was threatened to sell the car back by two senior JHU leaders. Minister 'superviced' abduction Environmental Affairs minister, Champika Ranawaka, and head of Environmental Authority, Udaya Gammanpila, personally supervised the abduction in which Hemantha was kept in a vehicle overnight, he told journalists in Colombo. The Buddhist monk-led JHU is a key ally of Rajapaksa administration. Dilruk Hemantha who regularly travels to Japan for business purposes said he requested his coordinator, Bandula Liyanage, to buy the luxury vehicle belonged to JHU leader on his behalf. ""Minister Ranawaka and Gammanpila threatened me to bring back the vehicle,"" Hemantha said. When JHU leaders were made aware that the media personnel were informed of the incident, Hemantha said, he was taken away by Ranawaka's supporters who constantly telephoned the minister and Gammanpila during the night. Life in danger ""Both Ranawaka and Gammanpila came twice to the car and talked to the abductors in Godagama and near Avissawella,"" he said. ""I feared my life was in danger when Minister Ranawaka threatened me to get into his vehicle in Godagama"". Later, Hemantha said, he was forced to make a statement to Homagama police denying media reports of abducting him. Hemantha who said he was shown the vehicle permit bearing Medhananda thero's name by the middleman who sold it for Rs. 13 million. ""Minister Ranawaka agreed to pay me Rs. 5.2 million but I disagreed,"" Hemantha said alleging that the monk MP has sold the permit to the middleman for Rs. 5.2 million.

Abandoned BBC Gardeners' World plot an 'urban veg hub',"By Matt LeeBBC News Online The show stopped filming at the Greenacre site in Edgbaston at the end of 2010, when it was relocated to Monty Don's own garden in Herefordshire. The land, which is owned by the nearby King Edwards School, has now been taken over by staff at the adjoining Winterbourne House and Botanic Garden, who have turned it into a hub for ""urban vegetable growing."" ""We want the centre to breakdown the misconception that you need an acre, a garden or an allotment to grow your own vegetables,"" said Anna Williams from the Winterbourne house team. ""There's an awful lot that you can do with just a balcony, like growing tomato plants and even if you've got a small yard you can get some planters and grow a great crop."" 'Chicken keeping' The Urban Veg project started on a small scale in March. Fifteen members of the Islamic community were invited to take up a plot in the walled garden at the Botanic garden to grow their own vegetables. Ms Williams said: ""Traditionally, people that come to visit botanic gardens are not necessarily representative of the communities which we live in. ""Birmingham is a very multi-cultural city and we felt that it would be great to break down those boundaries and get people into the garden who may have thought in the past it wasn't for them."" Winterbourne House said the success of that project led to them expanding it to other communities and taking over Greenacre. It said instead of inviting groups to take on plots as before, staff would maintain the garden and Urban Veg would be a training base. ""It's about fostering relationships with other community groups who want to start up their own initiatives where they live, but maybe they don't have the skills to do so,"" said Ms Williams. ""The courses will be available to anyone, whatever background, and will look at not only planting stuff in the ground but also bee keeping, chicken keeping, things like that."" 'Social reform' The garden will also be used to train 60 NHS staff from across the West Midlands region to become ""urban food growing champions."" Ms Williams said: ""After training here, they'll go back to their own NHS Trust areas to set up their own community garden groups to promote gardening for healthy living and healthy eating."" Winterbourne House was built in 1903 by British industrialist John Nettlefold, and Ms Williams said she felt Urban Veg was extending his legacy. ""He was active in the local community and felt strongly about social reform,"" she said. ""He was one of the first chairman of the Birmingham Housing Committee and he felt that everybody should have access to a garden and better living conditions. ""The idea here has the same ethic.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google shares drop on worries over advertising income,"Profits were $3.45bn (£2.05bn), but investors are preoccupied by Google's inability to maintain advertising prices. A widely watched measure, the average ""cost per click"", was down 9% from a year earlier. Another weak spot highlighted in the report was the firm's discounted sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo. Google sold the smartphone maker to Lenovo in January for close to $3bn, after paying $12.5bn for the firm less than two years ago. Despite investors' reaction, Google's chief executive, Larry Page, was upbeat: ""We completed another great quarter,"" he said in a statement. ""We got lots of product improvements done, especially on mobile. I'm also excited with progress on our emerging businesses."" However, Google continues to struggle with its ability to charge advertisers higher prices for mobile ads, which are increasingly important with more and more consumers accessing Google's browser through their smartphones. Advertisers have proven reluctant to pay as much for ads on mobile screens compared to Google's bread-and-butter desktop ads, which have been the main revenue generator at the firm. Rates for mobile ads can be half as much as on personal computers, according to Needham & Co analyst Kerry Rice. However, Google expects mobile ad prices to catch up with PCs eventually as it becomes easier for consumers to buy products using mobile devices, Google chief business officer Nikesh Arora said. 'A little bit dodgy' Google has greatly diversified its portfolio of products in recent years, speculatively branching out into phones, drones, Google Glass, and even thermostats and fire alarms, CNet technology analyst Larry Magid said. ""Some of these crazy ideas need to become less crazy and more profitable,"" he told the BBC. ""Their core business, what really brings in the money, that's beginning to get a little bit dodgy for them."" Google's results were not the only ones to disappoint investors on Wednesday. Technology giant IBM reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years. IBM attributed the drop in revenue, which went down 4% to $22.5bn, to weak hardware sales. Enterprise technology spending has shifted away from traditional computing giants as governments and corporations move towards online services, large-scale data analysis and IT security, FBR analyst Dan Ives said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Snowdon motorists 'towed' if they park illegally at Pen-y-Pass,"If follows chaotic scenes at Pen-y-Pass below the mountain last weekend, where vehicles turned the main road into a car park in places. It led to 180 vehicles being given penalty fines. Car parks at Pen-y-Pass will now be closed at the weekend, and only available for buses and taxis to drop-off hikers heading on to the peak. ""This is a 60mph area, and the irresponsible and dangerous parking we saw last weekend not only risked lives but also would have prevented emergency vehicle access,"" said Supt Neil Thomas, from North Wales Police. ""Anybody found to be parked on the clearway or causing an obstruction will have their vehicle removed at their own expense. Please heed the warning."" Pen-y-Pass sits on the main A4086 road between Llanberis and Capel Curig, and is where the Pyg Track path takes walkers to the top of Snowdon, making it one of the most popular destinations in the national park. However, all access to Snowdon and other popular peaks in the national park was closed in March, as part of coronavirus lockdown measures. Walkers and hikers were allowed back on the mountains when the ""stay local"" lockdown restrictions were eased on 6 July, while last weekend marked the start of the official school holidays for many visitors. Local residents accused visitors of treating the region with ""lack of respect"" after an estimated 500 cars lined verges and the roadside all down the pass. In addition to closing the pass car parks over the weekend, extra park-and-ride bus services will be put in place, running from nearby Llanberis and Nant Peris. Snowdon Sherpa buses will be running every 15 minutes between 06:45 in the morning and 18:40 in the evening. The buses link all the various Snowdon car parks with summit paths. ""These urgent measures will help to tackle the immediate challenge and we will continue to monitor and adapt as matters progresses,"" said Emyr Williams, chief executive of the Snowdonia Park Authority. The leader of Gwynedd council Dyfrig Siencyn added: ""We want people to be able to enjoy our stunning mountain ranges safely. ""Those who ignore the message by parking illegally on the highway on Snowdonia's mountain passes will face an on-the-spot fine or even being towed away by police.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Catalonia ex-officials freed by Belgian judge,"The judge said they could not leave the country without permission and had to give details of their accommodation. They had handed themselves in to Belgian police following an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia following an independence declaration. He has said he will not return to Spain unless he is guaranteed a fair trial. The five are wanted in Spain to face charges including rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. They are now expected to appear in court in Belgium within 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the five to Spain but, if they do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. ""The request made this afternoon by the Brussels' Prosecutor's Office for the provisional release of all persons sought has been granted by the investigative judge,"" said a statement by the Belgian prosecutor's office. Mr Puigdemont's political party, PDeCAT, said he had surrendered to police to show his ""willingness not to flee from the judicial process but to defend himself in a fair and impartial process, which is possible in Belgium, and highly doubtful in Spain"". Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia following a declaration of independence in the regional parliament. He sacked Mr Puigdemont, dissolved the parliament and called local elections for 21 December. The declaration of independence followed a referendum that the Spanish constitutional court had declared illegal. Mr Puigdemont's colleagues also listed on the EU arrest warrant are Meritxell Serret (former agriculture minister), Antoni Comín (former health minister), Lluís Puig (former culture minister), and Clara Ponsatí (former education minister). They all handed themselves in to Belgian federal police, accompanied by their lawyers, on Sunday morning and were questioned in a hearing lasting 10 hours. There were more protests in Catalan cities on Sunday against the detention of officials and activists held by the Spanish authorities. Protesters plastered city squares with posters depicting the detainees as political prisoners. Eight politicians are being held in an investigation into alleged rebellion and sedition linked to Catalonia's declaration of independence. Two activists are being detained in a separate investigation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Why charities are counting the costs of council cuts,"Patrick BurnsPolitical editor, Midlands It's the time of year when local authorities decide their budgets for the next 12 months, with an extra tightening of the belt dictated by George Osborne's Autumn Statement two months ago. But how are we to separate well-founded fears about the real impact of the austerity measures, from the torrents of political rhetoric on both sides of the argument? One minute council leaders predict ""the end of local government"", the next ministers warn them they must live within their means. I recall being challenged by BBC Midlands Today viewers after a report about cuts to council tax benefits. I explained the impact they might have on local claimants. More 'essential' ""What about us, the taxpayers, who foot the bill for all this?"" That was the challenge registered again and again in my inbox and in that of the programme itself. Some viewers argued that with the age of austerity had come a long overdue opportunity to tighten-up on benefits and non-essential council services. And there's the rub. How to distinguish between those areas of local spending which are more ""essential"" than others. The clearest definition is between statutory services like schools and refuse collection or disposal, and non-statutory ones including many of the adult services. Worcestershire County Council will decide next week whether or not to take £29m out of their budgets next year. Almost half, £13m, would come from Adult Social Care services, principally for elderly people and those with disabilities. Public satisfaction 'increased' One leading local charity could lose 50% of its funding from the council. West Mercia Women's Aid (WMWA) has been helping victims of domestic abuse, acting, in effect, as an agent of the council itself. WMWA warn this would lead to a scaling back of the support offered to recovering victims as well as slower response times from their 24-hour helpline. But the Communities and Local Government Department says it's all part of the drive to ensure everyone in the public sector does their bit to help pay down the deficit. ""Councils are successfully managing their budgets,"" says a spokeswoman. ""And, public satisfaction with public services has increased while council tax bills have been falling in overall real terms."" The department also points out that the average reduction in public sector spending power is 2.3%. Worcestershire County Council's reduction is 1.4%. Joining me in the studio for this week's Sunday Politics programme will be Jan Frances, WMWA's, chief executive; Jeremy Wright, Conservative MP for Kenilworth and Southam; and John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley. And I hope you will join us to, from 11:00 on BBC One Midlands this Sunday 9 February.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fifa indictment: What's in it,"By James ReevellBBC News Here are some of the key revelations from the US indictment against them. The charges They are more reminiscent of a mob film rather than the beautiful game: wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction of justice charges. If convicted the defendants could face 20 years in prison. South Africa 2010 World Cup The indictment alleges that Jack Warner, who was president of the federation that represents Central, North American and Caribbean football, Concacaf, accepted a $10m bribe from the South African government and Fifa officials to provide votes for the 2010 World Cup bid. The Copa America South America's regional football competition appears to have been the real money cow, with the US Department of Justice alleging that over a third of media rights were lost in bribes. 2011 Fifa presidential election Jack Warner allegedly tried to buy votes for the 2011 Fifa presidential election for a member of the Asian Football Federation. The report says that he invited voting members to a hotel room: ""Inside the room, Caribbean Football Union staff handed each official an envelope bearing the name of the member association that he represented. Inside each envelope was $40,000 in United States currency."" Bribes weren't just financial One alleged conspirator was reportedly bought an ""expensive painting from an art gallery in New York"" by one of the defendants, Costas Takkas. Other tournaments involved Pretty much any international tournament that was played in Latin America, the Caribbean and North America is said to have been affected. The Gold Cup, which features the United States and Mexico amongst others, is also named, along with Fifa World Cup qualifying matches. But Sepp Blatter was not In 164 pages, the Fifa president's name is not mentioned once. 'Major' US sportswear firm implicated The indictment includes allegations of bribery involving the sponsorship of the Brazilian national football team and a ""multinational sportswear company headquartered in the United States"". The company is not named, but there is widespread speculation it is Nike, who signed a deal with the Brazilian team in 1996 - the same year mentioned in the indictment. Nike has not confirmed it was involved, but said it opposed bribery and was co-operating with the authorities. Warner's family connection One of the highest-profile indictments is former Concacaf president Jack Warner. Mr Warner, who allegedly built a condominium in Florida for a family member using Concacaf funds, was one of the most powerful men in football until he resigned amidst a fraud inquiry. Two of his sons, Daryll and Daryan, pleaded guilty two years ago under indictments that have not been released until now. It has been speculated that the justice department has used informants as part of its case, with the Reuters news agency reporting in 2013 that Daryll had become a co-operative witness.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK diesel car sales fall by nearly a third in October,"The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) wants to see government-backed incentives to encourage people to buy low emission diesel vehicles. Overall vehicle sales fell by more than 12%, marking the seventh consecutive month of declines. The SMMT blamed a drop in business and consumer confidence for the fall. So far this year, new vehicle registrations are down by 4.6%. ""Declining business and consumer confidence is undoubtedly affecting demand in the new car market but this is being compounded by confusion over government policy on diesel,"" said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""We urge the government to use the forthcoming Autumn Budget to restore stability to the market, encouraging the purchase of the latest low emission vehicles as fleet renewal is the fastest and most effective way of addressing air quality concerns."" In its latest report, the SMMT said there were 158,192 new cars sold last month, a 12.2% decline. All sectors suffered declines, with business sales 26.8% lower, fleet sales down by 13% and private buyer demand falling by 10.1%. However, demand for Alternatively Fuelled Vehicles (AFV), including electric and hybrid, rose again, increasing by 36.9% to 8,244 registrations. Sales of petrol vehicles grew by 2.7%. ""However, these gains were unable to offset heavy losses in the diesel segment, as continuing consumer concerns resulted in its biggest hit yet, with demand down 29.9%,"" the SMMT said. Sales of diesel vehicles fell by 21.7% in September. 'Worrying news' The SMMT said overall vehicle sales for the year as a whole were set to come in at 2.565 million units, 4.7% down on 2016. The best selling model in October, and the year so far, was the Ford Fiesta. The EY Item Club described the sales figures as ""further disappointing and worrying news for the car sector"". ""Sales of diesel cars have been hit particularly hard by pollution concerns and air quality plans but the weakness in car sales runs significantly deeper than this,"" Consumers are ""uncertain"" and ""reluctant to make major purchases, it said, and ""car scrappage and trade-in schemes as well as discounting appear to have had a limited impact in getting pressurised consumers to splash out on a new car"", it added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Budget 2017: Tax on takeaway boxes to be considered,"In Wednesday's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to call for evidence on whether a tax on the use of the most environmentally damaging single-use plastics would help. Single-use plastics include packaging, bubble wrap, and polystyrene takeaway boxes. Greenpeace said ocean plastic pollution was ""a global emergency"". Meanwhile, Stephen Hammond, a close friend of the chancellor, has told the BBC the chancellor wants to use the Budget to ""attack problems"" that contributed to the Tories' poor election performance. He plans to use ""headroom"" in the public finances to target spending on housing and health, the former transport minister told Newsnight. 'Heartbreaking' The Treasury said the work on a potential plastic tax would examine the lifecycle of single-use plastics. It did not suggest the investigation would include plastic bottles, which can be recycled, although in practice many also end up in land-fill or the sea. However, the government has already said it would consider whether to introduce a ""reward and return"" scheme for plastic bottles to try to improve recycling rates. The Treasury said the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year in the UK would fill London's Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times, and cited the success of the 5p charge on plastic bags to illustrate the feasibility of a levy. Birds, sea mammals and turtles die from consuming or becoming tangled in plastic waste. Sir David Attenborough recently described the ""heartbreaking"" sight of an albatross feeding plastic to its young chick instead of fish. Sue Kinsey, senior pollution policy officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said plastic was a ""complete menace"" in the marine environment. ""It takes a long time to break down and it's almost indigestible if animals eat it. ""The real danger is that animals are starving to death with stomachs full of plastic."" 'Dumped rubbish' Tisha Brown, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the move ""recognises the significance of the problem and the urgent need for a solution."" But shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman criticised the government for ""warm words"" on the environment while underfunding services and failing to enshrine EU protections in UK law. She said: ""While we support initiatives to decrease the use of non-recyclable materials, the slump in recycling figures and significant increase in litter and dumped rubbish under this government requires a far more strategic approach."" The call for evidence is expected to be launched in early 2018.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ofwat blamed for high water bills by committee of MPs,"A report from the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the regulator consistently overestimated water companies' costs. It said many householders would be ""appalled"" to learn their water bills could have been smaller. Ofwat said it would ""carefully consider"" the PAC's report. Household water bills averaged just under £400 per year last year. Windfall The committee of MPs said Ofwat regularly overestimated companies' financing and tax costs when setting price caps. The PAC said this meant the companies had made windfall gains of at least £1.2bn between them. It is asking Ofwat to review the way it assesses companies' cost of debt and tax and report back on how it intends to improve. The MPs also said they were worried about customers in areas where water was scarce paying to develop new capacity, despite the possibility that water trading between companies would be brought in in the future. Monopoly Ofwat came into being to oversee the 18 privately owned companies that supply separate areas with water and sewerage services after the service was privatised in 1989. They currently operate as local monopolies but the government has announced plans to free the market for limited competition between suppliers by the end of this parliament in 2020. The choice will involve services such as billing and customer services, but not the water supply itself. In Scotland, business customers can already choose such suppliers. 'Priority' PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""Ofwat was set up to protect the interests of customers, most of whom have no choice over who supplies their water yet must pay bills typically running to hundreds of pounds. ""Many householders will therefore be appalled to learn these bills could have been smaller had Ofwat adopted a different approach to setting price limits for water companies. ""This approach must be reviewed as a priority."" Ofwat chief executive Cathryn Ross said: ""Holding companies to account and protecting customers is at the heart of what we do. ""That's why we've made sure bills will fall by 5% by 2020. We will carefully consider the thoughts of the PAC."" She added: ""If companies don't step up - we'll step in."" Consumer Council for Water chief executive Tony Smith said the PAC findings ""echo the concerns we have repeatedly raised with Ofwat that it has been too generous to water companies in past price settlements, to the detriment of water customers."" The consumer group added that Ofwat ""needs to... deliver a fair balance between company shareholders and customers"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Theresa May to visit Africa for first time as prime minister,"Mrs May will fly to South Africa on Tuesday before travelling to Nigeria and Kenya as part of a trade mission aimed at boosting post-Brexit fortunes. The prime minister said the trip would be a ""unique opportunity at a unique time for the UK"". She added the UK wanted to ""deepen and strengthen its global partnerships"" as it prepared to leave the EU in 2019. Mrs May will be accompanied to the three countries - all of them Commonwealth countries - by a 29-strong business delegation. Security issues will also feature on her agenda and she is expected to discuss the threat of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the role of British troops based in Kenya who are helping countries fight al-Shabab militants in Somalia. The PM's diary Tuesday - Mrs May will fly into Cape Town where she will meet young people, before delivering a keynote speech on trade and how UK private sector investment can be brought into Africa. After a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, she is expected to visit Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Wednesday - Mrs May intends to meet Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in the capital Abuja before meeting victims of modern slavery in Lagos. Thursday - In Kenya, Mrs May will meet president Uhuru Kenyatta before visiting British troops and a business school. A state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta will conclude the trip. Mrs May's visit to Nairobi will mark the first by a UK prime minister to Kenya since Margaret Thatcher in 1988. It is also the first to Sub-Saharan Africa by a British leader since David Cameron in 2013 for Mr Mandela's memorial service. Mrs May said a ""prosperous, growing and trading Africa"" was ""in all of our interests"", adding the continent's ""incredible potential will only be realised through a concerted partnership between governments, global institutions and business"". A Downing Street spokeswoman added: ""The PM will use the visit to announce further support to tackle instability across the region, because nations can't prosper without it."" During her time in South Africa, Mrs May is also due to present a World War One relic - linked to one of the worst maritime disasters in English waters - to Mr Ramaphosa. The SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight in 1917 killing more than 600 South Africans en route to the Western Front to support British troops. The ship's bell was given to BBC reporter Steve Humphrey in 2017 in a plastic bag at Swanage Pier, Dorset, after an anonymous phone call - and will now be handed back by Mrs May.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Shark nations failing on conservation pledges,"By Richard BlackEnvironment correspondent, BBC News The wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic and the Pew Environment Group say most of the main shark fishing nations do not manage fisheries well. Ten years ago, governments agreed a global plan to conserve sharks. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed each year, with nearly a third of species at risk of extinction. Many fisheries target the fins for use in shark fin soup; and a number of countries, including the US, have recently passed measures aimed at regulating the trade. Neither of the two countries catching the most sharks - Indonesia and India - has yet finalised national plans of action for protecting sharks. This was one of the main recommendations of the 2001 agreement under the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that sharks needed international management. Of the top 20 shark-catching nations, which collectively account for 80% of the global catch, only 13 have national plans in place. ""The fate of the world's sharks is in the hands of the top 20 shark catchers, most of which have failed to demonstrate what, if anything, they are doing to save these imperilled species,"" said Glenn Sant, leader of Traffic's global marine programme. ""They need to take action to stop the decline in shark populations, and help ensure that the list of species threatened by overfishing does not continue to grow."" Sharks are particularly vulnerable to overfishing because they live long lives and reproduce slowly. As well as intentional fishing, many are caught accidentally in large nets and on the hooks of longline boats targeting species such as tuna and marlin. Traffic and Pew are asking the FAO to review implementation of the 10-year-old agreement when it meets later this year. The 10 recommendations to governments agreed back in 2001 include identifying and protecting key habitat, ensuring catches are sustainable, and minimising waste and discards. Many sharks are top predators; and there is an abundance of biological evidence to show their removal can have major impacts on the rest of the ecosystem. ""Where shark populations are healthy, marine life beneath the waves thrives; but where they have been overfished we see that world fall out of balance,"" said Jill Hepp, Pew's global shark conservation manager. ""Shark-catching countries and entities must stand by their commitments and act now to conserve and protect these animals.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Carwyn Jones: Wales 'not too poor to be independent',"The former first minister said he believes that while the country would find it more difficult to borrow money, ""many other countries are in the red"". During a National Eisteddfod discussion, he said there was no future in ""England and Wales"" if Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the UK. Lecturer Jeff Williams-Jones said campaigners needed to make the economic case ""on evidence, not emotion"". While Mr Jones has previously said the ""shambles in Westminster"" is driving curiosity in independence, he said his personal view was Wales is best served as part of the UK. However, marches calling for Wales to break free have recently taken place in Cardiff and Caernarfon. ""Many other countries are in the red... that is not unusual,"" Mr Jones said. ""We are not too poor to be independent, no."" But Mr Jones warned if the country did go it alone, the economy would not be ""transformed overnight"", pointing to the years of economic troubles Ireland suffered before thriving. He emphasised he was not a supporter of independence and would prefer a more equal partnership between the UK nations. But Mr Jones said the consequences needed to be discussed because a ""chaotic Brexit"" could lead to the break-up of the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to leave the EU on the 31 October deadline, whether there is a deal in place or not. If this happens, Sinn Fein wants a poll on Northern Ireland leaving the union to join the Republic of Ireland. In Scotland, the SNP intends to hold a second referendum on independence. There would be ""no future for an England and Wales"" if Northern Ireland and Scotland leave, Mr Jones said, and if England decided to go it alone ""we may end up independent by default"". ""That is why we need to be ready to think about these things, and be ready to discuss the matter now,"" he added. His objection to independence was not ""in principle"" but for ""practical"" reasons, adding: ""If I was living in an independent Wales it wouldn't make me more of a Welshman than I am now."" Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts challenged his view, pointing to the Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia - as examples of countries that experienced rapid growth in the 1990s following the break-up of the Soviet Union. And Sion Jobbins, chairman of campaign group Yes Cymru, said there would come a time when Welsh Labour would need to choose between loyalty to their party and independence.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jeremy Corbyn sets out Labour's EU stance,"He criticised the EU over free trade, agriculture and Greece but backed its financial transactions tax that the Conservative government has opposed. Mr Corbyn was under growing pressure from MPs to clarify his position. It comes after he told the BBC his EU policy was ""developing"". In other developments: Since being elected on Saturday, Mr Corbyn's position on the EU has come under increased scrutiny. During the campaign he said he had ""mixed feelings"" on the union and suggested there were circumstances in which he would advocate a vote to leave. He has also insisted Mr Cameron should not be given a ""blank cheque"" in negotiations about the UK's EU membership ahead of a future in-out referendum. 'Damaging changes' Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said he would quit if Mr Corbyn called for a UK exit. On Thursday, Mr Corbyn, who told the BBC that Labour would not campaign to leave, wrote to the party's MPs confirming that it would be campaigning to stay in. This led shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden to agree to stay in his role. Mr Corbyn set out his policy in a Financial Times article, warning Mr Cameron against trying to ""weaken workers' rights"" as part of his renegotiations. ""Our shadow cabinet is also clear that the answer to any damaging changes that Mr Cameron brings back from his renegotiation is not to leave the EU but to pledge to reverse those changes with a Labour government elected in 2020,"" he said. He criticised the planned trade deal with the United States, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and said many people were ""appalled"" at the EU's treatment of Greece. And he said he would work with other EU nations to bring in a financial transactions tax, which is the subject of a legal challenge from the UK government over fears it would damage the City of London. ""Labour is clear that we should remain in the EU. But we too want to see reform,"" he wrote in the Financial Times. He added: ""If Mr Cameron fails to deliver a good package or one that reduces the social gains we have previously won in Europe, he needs to understand that Labour will renegotiate to restore our rights and promote a socially progressive Europe.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Female MPs write letter 'in solidarity' with Meghan amid media scrutiny,"Led by Labour MP Holly Lynch, the letter criticises the tone of recent stories about Meghan as ""outdated"", ""colonial"" and invading her privacy. ""It cannot be allowed to go unchallenged,"" the group of 72 cross-party MPs say. The duchess recently began legal action against the Mail on Sunday. It is accused of unlawfully publishing a private letter to her father. In the letter, shared on Twitter by Ms Lynch, the MPs say they ""share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation"" faced by many women in public life. ""With this in mind we expect the national media to have the integrity to know when a story is in the national interest, and when it is seeking to tear a woman down for no apparent reason,"" they say. ""You have our assurances that we stand with you in solidarity on this."" The MPs then pledged to use the ""means at our disposal"" to ensure the press accept her right to privacy, show respect, and that their stories ""reflect the truth"". Among the MPs to sign the letter were Labour MP Yvette Cooper, Lib Dem MP Angela Smith, and Tory MP Tracey Crouch. 'Colonial undertones' What else did the MPs say in the open letter? The MPs wrote: ""As women MPs of all political persuasions, we wanted to express our solidarity with you in taking a stand against the often distasteful and misleading nature of the stories printed in a number of our national newspapers concerning you, your character and your family. ""On occasions, stories and headlines have represented an invasion of your privacy and have sought to cast aspersions about your character, without any good reason as far as we can see. ""Even more concerning still, we are calling out what can only be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories. ""As women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged."" The letter follows an emotional ITV documentary last week, when Meghan and the Duke of Sussex described the pressure they had faced from intense media scrutiny. In the film, the duchess admitted motherhood was a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. She also said that she was not prepared for the intensity of the tabloid media scrutiny. In a statement released at the beginning of October, when Meghan launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday, Prince Harry said the ""painful"" impact of intrusive media coverage had driven the couple to take action. The duke later filed his own proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking dating back more than a decade.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sudan death penalty reignites Islam apostasy debate,"Dr Meriam Yahya Ibrahim was condemned to hang for allegedly leaving Islam and marrying a Christian man. The court said that by doing so, she had abandoned her religious faith and was guilty of apostasy, which carries the ultimate penalty under Islamic law in the country. But some liberal religious scholars have argued apostasy is not even a crime. They back up their beliefs by citing the Koranic verse which states: ""There shall be no compulsion in religion."" Other more conservative Muslims refer to the words of the Prophet Muhammad in the Hadith saying: ""It is not permissible to spill the blood of a Muslim except in three [instances]: A life for a life; a married person who commits adultery; and one who forsakes his religion and separates from the community."" Day of judgement Islam's legal system - Sharia - says apostasy covers a wide range of offences, including conversion to another religion, idol worship, or mistreating the Koran. While some scholars favour the death penalty, others say the punishment should be left to God on the day of judgement. The late Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious and political leader, famously denounced the author Salman Rushdie as an apostate for his novel The Satanic Verses - and said he should be killed. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan also uphold strict interpretations. In 2006, an Afghan, Abdul Rahman, who announced his conversion to Christianity escaped a death sentence and was offered asylum in Italy. Another Afghan citizen was granted asylum in the UK earlier this year after persuading the courts he faced the death penalty at home because he was an atheist. Meanwhile, non-Muslims such as the Bahai community have faced difficulties in countries including Egypt. 'Abhorrent' Human rights groups have condemned Islamic laws on apostasy. Amnesty International has described the latest case in Sudan as ""abhorrent"". ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice … should never be even considered,"" it said. When she was convicted on Sunday, Dr Ibrahim - who is said to be eight months pregnant - was given three days by the court to return to Islam. But she again affirmed her Christian faith, and her lawyer says she will appeal against the sentence. For now, her fate hangs in the balance. And the debate over apostasy - and whether she committed a crime in the first place - goes on.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Restricted embryo growth 'predicts miscarriage risk',"Scientists found that 78% of single-baby pregnancies which ended in miscarriage were in the smallest 5% of embryos. Researchers measured the length of more than 500 single and twin embryos during the first trimester. An expert said the study added to our knowledge of miscarriage risk. The research was presented at the British Fertility Society annual meeting in Leeds. The Nottingham researchers tracked the growth of 247 single and 264 twin embryos conceived through IVF, because this allowed them to know the embryos' precise gestational age. For each embryo, the distance from the top of the embryo's head to the bottom of its buttocks (the crown-rump length), was measured once during the first trimester using an ultrasound scan. The pregnancy was then monitored until birth. Poor growth Using the measurements, the researchers discovered that poor growth in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy was a good predictor of miscarriage. They calculated that 77.8% of single embryo pregnancies that miscarried were growth restricted, while 98.1% of single embryo pregnancies that did not miscarry were not growth restricted. This was not the case in twin pregnancies, however, where only 28.6% of pregnancies that miscarried were growth restricted. Ninety-eight per cent of twin pregnancies that did not miscarry were not growth restricted. Dr Shyamaly Sur, who led the research, said the findings should help to identify pregnancies at risk of miscarriage. ""There are various reasons why some embryos show restricted growth in the early stages of pregnancy. It could be down to an abnormality in the foetus or something in the environment of the womb."" Underlying causes ""More research is now needed to investigate the relationship between growth and the underlying causes of miscarriage in more detail. ""We are focusing on how blood flow to the womb lining and embryo quality influence conception rates and subsequent miscarriage."" Dr Raj Mathur, consultant gynaecologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said it was a very good study which made biological sense. But he said there were other factors to consider when looking at miscarriage risk. ""We also need to consider the woman's health history, look at the picture of the whole woman. ""This study adds to our knowledge about risk but we also need to look at blood supply to the embryo and whatever genes are passed on from the father too."" The study also found that twin embryos grew at the same rate as single embryos during the first trimester, which was not expected. ""There is something else going on with twin embryos.

Elections 2021: Tory Giles Orpen-Smellie wins Norfolk PCC election,"Mr Orpen-Smellie won after voters' second choices were included when no candidate polled more than 50%. In the first count, he led the contest with 45.1% of first votes and secured a total share of 63.3% when the second choices were added. Labour's Michael Rosen had 22.1% in the first count and increased his share to 36.7%. Turnout was 32.9%. The candidates eliminated after the first round were Liberal Democrat John Crofts in third place with 13.7%; the Greens' Martin Schmierer, who polled 10.2%; and the independent candidate David Moreland with 8.9%. People who voted for the three eliminated candidates as first choice saw their second choices brought into play. Under the supplementary vote system, second choice votes are only used if they are for the remaining two lead candidates. Mr Orpen-Smellie, who lives in Fakenham, is a former Army officer who served with the Parachute Regiment for 34 years. He is also a member of the Ministry of Justice's War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Tribunal. He will be taking office on 13 May. Lorne Green, who was elected PCC for the Conservatives in 2016, did not seek re-election this time. PCCs oversee the work of their local police force. Earlier in the count, organisers threatened to stop the process as some members of the political parties failed to observe social distancing. A loudspeaker plea for compliance was issued at the Norfolk Showground Arena, chosen to hold the count because of its spaciousness. BBC East's political correspondent Andrew Sinclair said ""a rather exasperated person said 'please observe two metres or we will have to stop the count'."" He said one person told him ""we had real problems with some of the candidates and their supporters yesterday when it came to social distancing"". ""They seemed to think it didn't apply to them,"" he said. Some of the ballots for the Norfolk County Council elections were counted there on Friday.

Supplier of halal meat containing pork DNA is named,"McColgan's Quality Foods Limited was the source of ""the very small number of halal savoury beef pastry products,"" said food distributor 3663. The County Tyrone company said it was co-operating with The Food Standards Agency. 3663 carried out tests on five products after suspecting the halal products may have contained horsemeat. A 3663 company spokeswoman said it was ""shocked"" to find pork DNA traces. Under Islamic law, Muslims are required to eat halal food - and eating pork is strictly forbidden. 'Swift measures' The 3663 spokeswoman added the affected products had been withdrawn from supply and were only distributed to prisons. ""The products in question are from one particular food manufacturer, McColgan's Quality Foods Limited, and have not been distributed to any other customer. All halal products from this manufacturer have been withdrawn"" 3663 said initial tests were carried out on the products after the manufacturer's name appeared on a report by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) following an investigation which discovered horsemeat in some frozen burgers. ""3663 recognised a potential connection between a supplier of halal savoury pie products for the Ministry of Justice and one of their halal beef suppliers mentioned with the FSAI report,"" the company said. 3663 said horsemeat was not found but ""disappointingly, we received evidence that within the products tested there were traces of porcine protein. McGolgan's, based in County Tyrone since the mid-1970s, employs about 100 people at its site on the Dublin Road, Strabane. A spokesman for McColgan's said: ""McColgan's has already taken swift measures to identify, isolate and withdraw all of the products which are supplied to the Prison Service while an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding this deeply regrettable and unforeseen incident takes place. ""McColgan's is keen to stress that at no point has pork of any kind been included in the recipes of any of the Halal-certified products it supplies."" The Food Standards Agency is now investigating whether the contaminated products were distributed more widely across the UK. Steve Wearne, from the Food Standards Agency, said it had called an urgent meeting ""of a range of suppliers"" on Monday where it would ""stress again the responsibility of all food businesses to ensure the food that they sell contains what it says on the label"". Islamic law Halal meat is defined as meat slaughtered by hand and blessed by the person doing the killing, however some Muslims believe a mechanised form is also now acceptable. The editor of the Muslim News, Ahmed Versi, said: ""This is very serious because no Muslim would ever eat pork meat - anything to do with pork - and it must be very distressing for those in prison who have been given this meat to realise they may have been eating food which was contaminated with pig.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Young 'to be poorer than parents at every stage of life',"The study, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), added that households actually grew richer during the financial crisis. But it said that the reason for the growth between 2006-12 was the increase in pension values over the period. And the slow rate of growth in overall wealth suggested that young people would lag behind earlier generations. Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report said: ""Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements."" Households aged between 45-54 saw the biggest increases in their pension wealth which rose on average by £38,000 over the period. Mr Innes added: ""Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier."" Vast range The report added that the range of experiences among the study group was vast - for example, a quarter of households aged 45-54 saw wealth fall by more than £69,000, while a quarter say their wealth increased by more than £138,000. The study also looked at people's attitude towards saving and pensions. 30% of individuals reported saving for an unexpected expense, 23% reported saving for holidays or leisure, 15% for planned expenses, 10% for other people and only 10% to provide a retirement income. Among households aged 25-34, nearly one-quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement. However, one third expected it would be their largest source of income after retirement. Despite new legislation that automatically enrols workers into workplace pension schemes, nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension. Rowena Crawford, a Senior Research Economist at the IFS and another author of the report, said: ""It is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income."" ""It will be interesting to see how these attitudes change as auto enrolment into workplace pensions is rolled out.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Brexit: Welsh resorts to 'benefit"" from EU exit uncertainty","The Easter holidays were due to be the first break after Britain left the European Union, before the government delayed the initial 29 March deadline. Tourism bosses say the weak pound and uncertainty could add to the 10 million annual overnight trips to Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance is positive there will be a ""Brexit bounce"". The drop in the value of the pound has made foreign holidays more expensive and many operators in Wales are reporting greater interest as 2019's holiday season begins at the Easter break. About 90% of overnight trippers to Wales are from the UK staycation market and that could rise with a scorching summer similar to last year. ""People are understandably nervous about going to Europe,"" said Andrew Campbell, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance. ""There is also a lot of uncertainty and people are holding on to their cash."" The alliance, which represents more than 7,000 businesses, spoke to delegates in Pembrokeshire on Friday about the ""opportunities"" for Welsh tourism because of Brexit. ""Since the decision was made to leave the EU, the tourism industry has benefited,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism liaison manager Dennis O'Conner. ""We have received lots of international visitors because the pound is so low and more and more people are looking at staycations."" 'Opportunity' One holiday letting company, FBM Holidays, which has 300 properties across west Wales, is preparing for its busiest year for three years, while the 350-cottage Bluestone resort is already ahead of its 2018 summer occupancy rate with three months remaining. The Caravan Club in Wales, as well as across the rest of the UK, has recorded its best quarter in a decade while bookings at Mark Whitehouse's holiday park in Fishguard is up 25% for this summer. ""It has given us a small window of opportunity to introduce new customers to UK tourism,"" he said. ""The hysteria will settle down and people will start going abroad again but hopefully we will retain a proportion of them."" 'Holding their breath' There is also a feeling in the industry that some holidaymakers are waiting to see the impact of Brexit before booking their summer break. ""People are holding their breath to see if there is going to be any impact on their income before they book their holidays,"" said Pembrokeshire Tourism chair Jane Rees-Baynes, who runs Elm Grove Country House near Tenby. ""People maybe waiting to see if they need to worry about passport queues and things like car insurance on the continent. It will be a lot more last minute this year.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pro-Putin social media campaign hijacked by critics,"By George Pierpoint, BBC UGC and Social NewsAnd Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The hashtag, which translates as #RussiaNeedsPutin, began as a choreographed political campaign by accounts linked to the ruling United Russia party ahead of the presidential election this year. The tweets praised Mr Putin's ability to unite the country and his role in guiding Russia through the turbulent post-cold war years. The hashtag has been among the top trending topics on Russian social media since 14 January, and has been used almost 7,000 times on Twitter in the same period. Although Mr Putin is running as an independent candidate rather than from United Russia, party-linked accounts began using the tag to coincide with efforts to collect signatures in support of Mr Putin's campaign for re-election. You may also like: Mr Putin needs 300,000 signatures from across the country to secure his place on the ballot for the election on 18 March. Many included the hashtag when posting photos of themselves pledging their support to the President at a number of registration points. Vladimir Putin has been in power, either as the Prime Minister or President, since the year 2000 and enjoys huge popularity with many Russians. However, those critical of the President seized the popularity of the hashtag to highlight issues facing the country and the restriction of political freedoms within it. A critic wrote: ""Russia needs roads, education, medicine, to fight against corruption, gasification, free higher education, alternation of power, parliamentary regime, freedom of enterprise and free media. This is what Russia needs and not Putin."" One Twitter user mocked those extolling Mr Putin's virtues: ""Don't know about you, but I want more violation of my constitutional rights, I want our country to degrade me and the people to become even more stupid. Mr Putin, may Russian Christ protect you!"" ""Corruption, rampant corruption, citizens' rights abuse, nominating only the 'right' people as candidates, ignoring public opinion, police brutality, low wages, arresting people at peaceful demos, yesyesyes, #RussiaNeedsPutin"" The rise and origins of the hashtag have sparked questions about the role of pro-Kremlin bots in amplifying the popularity of the term.

"Step down now, David Cameron urges President Assad","Thousands of people have died in fighting since a rebellion against the ruling regime began. The UK prime minister told a committee of senior MPs that ""the best path to peace"" for Syria was a ""transition at the top"", not a bloody revolution. He called the Assad regime, which has barred the Red Cross from the city of Homs, ""illegitimate and criminal"". Mr Cameron was addressing the Liaison Committee, made up of chairmen of the Commons select committees which scrutinise government departments. After a siege and bombardment of the Baba Amr district of Homs, lasting nearly a month, security forces moved into the area last Thursday following the withdrawal of armed rebels. 'No shift' Last month China and Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria. Russia said the document had singled out the government and did not contain measures against armed opposition groups, and China said ""imposing a solution"" would not help to resolve the issue. Activists say 7,500 people have been killed since the uprising began almost a year ago. The Syrian government blames ""terrorists and armed gangs"" for the violence. Mr Cameron, who spoke to Russia's Vladimir Putin following his victory in the country's presidential election at the weekend, said he had urged him to change his mind on the UN resolution but added: ""I did not sense any sign of a shift."" He told the MPs: ""I don't think we are ever going to agree on everything about Syria... but we need to agree that, at the very least, there's humanitarian access. ""I think they are absolutely wrong to take their position. They do have considerable influence in Syria. What they have done is very bad for their reputation across the Arab world. ""The Arab world is united in wanting to end the bloodshed in Syria."" The UN estimates 70,000 people have been displaced since the uprising began. Mr Cameron said: ""What's happening is absolutely appalling... The bloodshed being organised and carried out by this regime is criminal."" He added: ""The best path to peace for Syria is a transition at the top of the regime, with Assad going... the idea of transition at the top is a better outcome, and less bloody, than a revolution at the bottom."" Asked whether the UK could help to arm the rebels, as happened in Libya last year, Mr Cameron replied: ""At this point I think the right approach is to bring together the international community, put diplomatic pressure on the regime, work with the opposition to make sure they've got a proper outward face and then to work out what more we can do to help them pile the pressure on. ""I think we are at that stage, rather than going much further.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Lack of evidence' holding back cannabis medicines,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Multiple sclerosis patients and parents of children with severe epilepsy have been fighting for access to the drugs. The NHS England report found hospitals also had issues affording the medicines and getting hold of a safe supply. The report said the health service must support studies to gather evidence ""as soon as possible"". The law was changed in November 2018 to allow specialist doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis for the first time. The decision fuelled demand from parents of children with severe epilepsy, who were having hundreds of seizures a week, as well as patients with muscle stiffness caused by multiple sclerosis. But the demand rapidly turned to frustration as the drugs were hard if not impossible to get hold of. Some families admit to smuggling cannabis-based medicines into the UK and spending £1,500 a month on the drugs. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, ordered NHS England to investigate why the drugs were not being prescribed. The NHS review said the ""major hurdle"" was doctors being unsure of the benefits and long-term safety of the drugs - because of a lack of randomised clinical trials. These are the ""gold standard"" of medical research. And the review said the NHS must support such trials as well as look at other forms of evidence. Peter Carroll, the director of the End Our Pain Campaign, said: ""There are many positives in this review, in particular with regards to the evidence that can and should be taken into account relating to medical cannabis. ""But the fact remains that the families we represent are in urgent need of access to medical cannabis right now."" But even if doctors thought a cannabis prescription was appropriate, the report showed NHS funding was a problem and hospitals felt the costs were ""unsustainable in the long term"". There were also concerns the drugs - which are often unlicensed - are not of high enough quality. 'Too expensive' Meanwhile, the body that advises on best treatments, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has issued guidance to doctors. In the case of Sativex, a cannabis-based medicine for spasticity in multiple sclerosis, NICE said it was too expensive. ""We recognise that some people will be disappointed that we have not been able to recommend the wider use of cannabis-based medicinal products,"" said Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at NICE. The MS Society and Epilepsy Action charities both said they were disappointed by the guidelines. Follow James on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Legacy inquests: Families launch legal bid over funding,"By Vincent KearneyBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent It is a bid to force the release of funds for inquests into the deaths. Northern Ireland's most senior judge has requested funding for a five-year plan to hear all outstanding legacy inquests. It has been estimated the cost would be at least £10m. As part of the Fresh Start Agreement, the government pledged £150m for legacy issues. However, it said the money would not be released until there is a political agreement on how to deal with the past. Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan asked for the money that is needed for his plan to be released before an overall agreement is reached. But the request was blocked by First Minister Arlene Foster. Two months ago, Sir Declan called for urgent action, and said there is a legal obligation on the government and the Stormont Executive to ensure the inquests are heard. Lawyers representing the relatives of more than 30 people people killed during the Troubles have now initiated legal action. They are seeking a judicial review of the refusal to provide the resources needed for the inquests. The application has been made in the name of the daughter of one of 10 people shot dead by soldiers in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast in 1971. A hearing has been listed for 14 December. The lawyers are asking the courts to order the Department of Justice and the office of the First and Deputy First Minister, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness, to immediately implement the legacy plan. They are also seeking an order to compel the Northern Ireland Secretary of State to use his legal powers to direct that immediate steps are taken to implement Sir Declan's proposal. A lawyer for the families, Padraig Ó Muirigh, said the relatives felt they had no option but to go to court. ""This issue shouldn't be dependent upon a political agreement, it's a stand-alone issue,"" he said. ""We hope that the court directs that action is taken on this. ""These families have waited a very, very long time. There has been an unacceptable delay, their human rights have been breached. ""Going to court was an option of last resort, but we hope with the court's interference that this issue can move forward."" In September, Mr Ó Muirigh handed a letter to an official representing the secretary of state warning that legal action would be launched if funding for the inquests was not released within 14 days. The Stormont Executive and Department of Justice received similar letters. But in a statement released at the time, a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) made it clear that the secretary of state believed it is up to Stormont to resolve the issue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Disabled man's holiday prize 'not wheelchair friendly',"The man won a week-long, all-inclusive trip to France with Go Provence Supported Holidays, as advertised in PosAbility Magazine in December 2016. The resort was aimed at those with learning difficulties and disabilities, the advert said. The Advertising Standards Authority said it breached rules. Following a complaint from the man, the ASA ruled the competition was ""misleading"" because it appeared ""in the context of a disability lifestyle magazine"". Holiday company Go Provence said ""disability had a wide definition"" and readers would have needed to check to see if the accommodation was accessible. You may also like: Meet the man giving disabled kids a voice Watch: The learning disability rave It said it would have accommodated the winner's needs, but the man had decided not to accept the prize due to the additional costs this would incur. The company also stated that the advert appeared alongside images of a group on a rafting trip and people jumping in a lavender field, which it argued ""would lead readers to check whether the holiday would be suitable for wheelchair users"". PosAbility Magazine said it had not received any complaint about the competition, so it had not had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the complainant. It said it understood the accommodation offered was ""reasonably accessible"" and so the man may have been able to take up the prize. The magazine said the terms and conditions of the competition had stated the trip included kayaking, a mini cruise, swimming in nearby lakes and other activities. It considered the changes required from the winner were ""all related to personal preference and were not necessary to allow him to take up the prize"". 'Likely to mislead' But the ASA said the competition breached advertising standards because it appeared in a disability lifestyle magazine, surrounded by articles for physically disabled readers. This meant ""accessibility was a significant condition"" which would influence whether someone entered the competition, it said. It said the advert was not ""sufficiently clear"" that wheelchair users may be unable to access the accommodation, and it must not appear in its current form again. ""We told Go Provence and PosAbility to ensure that their future promotions included relevant applicable significant conditions where their omission was likely to mislead, including whether or not a competition prize was accessible for readers who used a wheelchair.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Spinal muscular atrophy: Families plead for drug to slow disease,"Families calling for Spinraza to be approved to treat people with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are set to protest at a meeting later. NICE previously refused to recommend it because of uncertainties over its long-term effectiveness and high cost. Parents say the drug could be life-changing for those with the disease. SMA is a genetic condition that makes muscles weaker and causes problems with movement. Katie Prescott's daughter Heidi, 11, has had the condition since birth, but was not diagnosed until she was three. ""She can't walk on her own, she has to hold on to me and can only take a few steps,"" Mrs Prescott, from Wolverhampton, said. ""She struggles with her arm strength, taking a jumper on and off is difficult."" Mrs Prescott added Heidi was mentally unaffected, very bright and aware of what was happening to her body. She has weekly physiotherapy and uses a standing frame. Mark and Panna Wilson, from Oadby, Leicestershire, said they were considering moving so three-year-old Aadi could access Spinraza. Aadi was diagnosed with SMA at 15 months and now struggles to breathe. Mr Wilson said: ""Aadi is a bright, funny, clever toddler, but his mobility has deteriorated, and that's difficult to manage as parent. ""There is a treatment that could change our life. ""We know there is no certainty and that Spinraza doesn't have the same effect on everyone, but it gives us hope."" Charity TreatSMA said Spinraza, the trade name of a drug containing nusinersen, could normalise protein levels in the gene that causes SMA and stop motoneuron degeneration. The charity has arranged for parents to protest outside a NICE appraisal meeting in Manchester later, calling for the use of the drug to be approved. Mrs Prescott's Labour MP Eleanor Smith raised the subject at Prime Minister's Questions in February, calling for the drug to be made available in England, as it will be in Scotland. An independent committee will meet in public later before making a recommendation in a private session. NICE will then publish a draft recommendation within a month. If no appeals are made, it will later be published as final guidance. Meindert Boysen, director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE, said it had been in discussions with the drug's maker, Biogen, about how it can address uncertainties and be made cost effective. Mr Boysen said it had ""taken us longer than we would have liked to get to the position we're in today"" but it was time for a ""meaningful discussion about Spinraza"" and ""what it would take to make it available to patients in England"". Doug Henderson, from Spinal Muscular Atrophy UK, said there were ""unacceptable delays"" in England, while Rob Burley, from Muscular Dystrophy UK, added: ""Without access to Spinraza, children may irreversibly lose the ability to walk, crawl and swallow.""

Barclays 'fails to fund' London cycle hire expansion,"A document from August 2011, released via a Freedom of Information request, showed Transport for London (TfL) had expected £10m from the bank towards phase three of the scheme. The roll out to south-west London was partly funded by local councils. TfL said they still ""expect to receive a contribution"" from Barclays. Barclays said they were were in discussions to finalise a ""legal amendment"" to the existing contract. 'Free advertising' The document obtained by the website MayorWatch, showed Barclays had pledged a further £10m towards the expansion, but the deal was never formalised by TfL. The deal signed by Barclays in 2010 secured £25m in funding for the first two stages of the scheme. London Assembly members have asked the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, why Barclays' logo appears on the scheme's livery in Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth and Kensington and Chelsea. Labour member Val Shawcross said the company had been handed ""at least £10m of free advertising"". She said: ""Not only does this undermine the whole point of bringing in sponsors to part-fund public transport projects, but it appears London boroughs - and their council tax payers - have had to stump up the missing money."" 'Expected contribution' Hammersmith and Fulham Council, Lambeth and Wandsworth councils collectively paid around £4m to the expansion, which took place in December. BBC London's political correspondent Tim Donovan said the rest of the money came out of TfL's budget. Martin Hoscik, from MayorWatch, said: ""The new document makes it clear that Barclays was expected to provide £10m for the third phase expansion and actually they provided... nothing. It looks like they benefitted from taxpayers PR."" In December, it was announced that Barclays would not be renewing its sponsorship when their current deal ends next year. Graeme Craig, director of commercial development at TfL, said: ""The heads of terms document was agreed and signed by TfL and Barclays in 2011 and set out the initial proposal for the additional £25m extension of the cycle hire sponsorship, subject to the agreement of a formal contract. ""They do, however, remain the sponsor of the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme until 2015 and we expect to receive a contribution from them for the phase three extension."" Following its decision not renew its sponsorship, Barclays agreed that the initial £25m could be used for phases one, two and three of the project until August 2015, if a new sponsor was not found before that date, this deal included a written commitment to pay on a pro-rata basis for the phase three expansion. ""This commitment was made in writing ahead of the Phase 3 launch and Barclays and TfL are in discussions to finalise a legal amendment to the existing contract accordingly,"" a representative of the bank said. ""Barclays has offered to exit early from the sponsorship agreement to enable TfL to secure a new sponsor at the earliest opportunity.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rochdale child sex ring: Appeal against sentences refused,"The men from Rochdale and Oldham were jailed for between four and 19 years for offences including rape and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child in May last year. Their lawyers claimed a breach in jury confidentiality gave a right to appeal. However, the Criminal Appeal Office said permission had been refused. At trial, Judge Gerald Clifton said the men treated the girls, some who were as young as 13, ""as though they were worthless and beyond respect"". After sentencing, Alias Yousaf, the solicitor of one of the convicted men, Adil Khan, said an appeal would be lodged. He claimed comments on Twitter by the far-right group Infidels of Great Britain and the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin, showed the jury's deliberations had been leaked. 'No evidence' The tweet led eight defence lawyers to ask for the jury to be discharged and a re-trial to be held. But Judge Clifton said there was ""no evidence to suggest a juror was at fault"" and allowed the case to continue. A spokeswoman for the Criminal Appeal Office confirmed that permission to appeal was refused to all nine defendants by a single judge. Following the refusal, the men have two weeks during which they can renew their application for permission to appeal. All nine men were convicted of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with girls under the age of 16. Shabir Ahmed, 60, who was regarded as the ringleader, was jailed for a total of 19 years for conspiracy, two counts of rape, aiding and abetting a rape, sexual assault and a count of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation. Kabeer Hassan, 25, of Lacrosse Avenue, Oldham, was sentenced to nine years for rape and three years, concurrently, for the conspiracy conviction.

Fruit-shaped sensor 'can improve freshness',"The device - which mimics the size, shape and composition of real fruit - is packed in with produce in transit and closely monitors its temperature. It comes in orange, apple, banana and mango varieties, and alerts firms to problems with their cooling processes, allowing them to take action. It could also lead to fresher fruit for consumers, researchers said. The project, which is still at the trial stage, is being conducted by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa). Communications spokeswoman Cornelia Zogg explained: ""Mangos, bananas and oranges have usually travelled long distances by the time they reach our shops. ""However, not all the cargo makes it safely to its destination. ""Although fruit is inspected regularly, some of it is damaged or may even perish during the journey. This is because monitoring still has significant scope for improvement."" Fruit destroyed The researchers say this creates risks for both suppliers and consumers. State food agencies can order container loads of fruit to be destroyed if it hasn't been stored at the right temperatures. And fruit which is overripe or not fresh can end up being sold to consumers. ""Cargo could be left outside during a layover, or you could have a power outage during transit, all of which affects quality,"" project leader Thijs Defraeye told the BBC. ""Exporters do have ways to measure freshness, but our sensor is more accurate because it simulates the characteristics of individual types of fruit."" To achieve this, the team X-rayed real fruits and modelled their shape and texture, he says. They then determined the exact composition of each fruit's flesh and simulated it in a laboratory, using a mixture of water, carbohydrates and polystyrene. The mixture was poured into a fruit-shaped sensor mould, created on a 3D printer. Mr Defraeye said: ""If something goes wrong, suppliers will be able to access the temperature data from the whole journey and work out what happened. ""We hope this will help them control their sanitary protocols and cut the cost and time of logistics."" Field tests for the sensors are under way and the researchers are looking for potential commercial partners.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Before leaving Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to improve children's oral health. Her government produced a green paper on tackling the causes of preventable ill health. But the Faculty of Dental Surgery says that while progress has been made, more needs to be done. Dentist no-shows Tooth decay is the leading cause of hospital admissions among five-to-nine-year-olds over the last three years, its report says. Yet figures show that 41% of under-18s didn't visit an NHS dentist last year. And the figure is 77% among children aged between one and two, despite guidance that all children should see a dentist at least once a year. The faculty has produced a report containing 12 recommendations to try to cut down on cases of tooth decay. These include: Prof Michael Escudier, dean of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""It is incredibly worrying that levels of tooth decay among children in England remain so high - especially when you consider that it is almost entirely preventable through simple steps, such as brushing twice a day with appropriate-strength fluoride toothpaste, visiting the dentist regularly and reducing sugar consumption."" He added: ""The scourge of child dental decay cannot be allowed to continue. ""Everyone needs to play their part in ensuring our children have healthy, happy teeth."" The Faculty of Dental Surgery said a campaign to remind people how often to take their children to a dentist, and the availability of free NHS dental care, was needed. The British Dental Association said many parents were not aware that dental check-ups and treatment for under-18s were free. And it called for investment in a national oral health programme for children in England, matching those already set up in Scotland and Wales, to help children develop good habits from an early age. 'Scandal' BDA chairman Mick Armstrong said: ""It's a scandal that tooth decay remains the number one reason for child hospital admissions. ""We will not see real progress until ministers start going further and faster on prevention."" The Department for Education said schools in England had to provide pupils with a nutritious school meal and restrict foods high in sugar from lunch options. A spokesperson said: ""This includes a ban on drinks with added sugar, chocolate or sweets in school meals and vending machines. ""Additionally, we are in the process of updating these standards to further reduce the sugar content of school meals.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New whisky distillery built at historic Lindores Abbey,"Building work has begun at a site next to Lindores Abbey in Fife where whisky production dates back 500 years. The project is the brainchild of Drew McKenzie-Smith, whose family have owned the 12th Century abbey and neighbouring farm for more than 100 years. He hopes that the multi-million pound distillery and visitor centre will be up and running by next summer. The finished whisky product should be available by 2023. It will bring the history of Lindores Abbey full circle, as the earliest written evidence of whisky distillation in Scotland originates in its ruined grounds. An exchequer roll records that in 1494 one of the abbey's Tironension monks, Friar John Cor, paid duty on malt to make ""aqua vitae"" for King James IV. The distillery will be constructed on the site of a 200-year-old farm steading, which was built from the abbey's stones and located next to the ancient monument. Experts are now carefully demolishing the building before using the same stone to rebuild, convert and enlarge it into a modern distillery. Mr McKenzie-Smith, a farmer, said that the distillery will use barley produced on his own fields to make the whisky. ""We'll be using the same fields that the monks used 500 years ago to make 'aqua vitae',"" he added. ""We'll be using the same fields under the same sunshine."" And he hopes the project could safeguard the future of the ruined abbey, which is the final resting place of the ill-fated first Duke of Rothesay. It was also visited by William Wallace and King John Baliol before it was sacked at the behest of the reformer John Knox in 1559. A royalty from the sale of every bottle of whisky is likely to go into a trust that will preserve the abbey. Mr McKenzie-Smith said: ""To us, the history of Lindores Abbey is just as important as the plans we have to create a distillery. ""If it wasn't for the expertise of the Tironesian monks who came to Scotland in those dark and frightening medieval times we may not have the advanced industry we do today."" He hopes the development will draw tourists to the area around Newburgh. ""We believe a whisky distillery and visitor centre will help drive tourists to this part of Fife and, in turn, have a positive impact on the local economy,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gay marriage ban 'step too far' says Archbishop of Wales,"Dr Barry Morgan says the freedoms of the church would be curtailed by a ban. The UK government announced the Church in Wales and Church of England will be banned in law from offering gay marriages. Other religious organisations will be able to ""opt in"" to holding ceremonies. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said both organisations had ""explicitly"" stated strong opposition and would not be included. The plans are due to be introduced before the next election, in 2015. ""I think that's a step too far,"" Dr Morgan told BBC Radio Wales. Nurture ""This seems to exclude the possibility in the future."" He said although the Church in Wales was not currently contemplating offering same-sex marriages, he said the church believed in ""nurturing family life"". He said the law had ""curtailed"" the church's freedom. ""There are those of us who think it ought to be a free choice and this increases the hurdles for people to pass,"" Dr Morgan said. ""It will have to get the legislation changed in parliament and change its canon law - and it might be harder to change the law of the land than canon law. ""In my personal opinion it's a great pity it's illegal for us not to even have the possibility to do it. ""It should be left for us to opt in or opt out."" Some religious groups, including Quakers, Unitarians and Liberal Judaism, are in favour. Mrs Miller promised a ""quadruple lock"" to protect religious freedoms. Mrs Miller said: ""I am absolutely clear that no religious organisation will ever be forced to conduct marriages for same-sex couples, and I would not bring in a bill which would allow that. ""European law already puts religious freedoms beyond doubt, and we will go even further by bringing in an additional 'quadruple legal lock'. But it is also a key aspect of religious freedom that those bodies who want to opt in should be able to do so."" Prime Minister David Cameron said last week that he believed same-sex marriages should be allowed in churches - but only if there was a ""100%"" guarantee that no church, synagogue or mosque would be forced to hold one against their wishes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australia growth rate falls short of forecasts,"The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.6% compared to the previous quarter and 2.3% year-on-year. Most analysts had forecast a quarterly growth of about 0.7% and an annual expansion of close to 2.6%. Australia's economy has also been hurt by a global slowdown which has seen its mining boom wane recently. ""It looks like household consumption has probably been the main disappointment in the actual quarter,"" said Su-Lin Ong, an economist with RBC Capital Markets. ""It very much confirms the idea of an economy that is running around sub-trend pace and has a number of challenges,"" she added. 'Not good enough' Australia's economic growth over the past few years has been powered by the success of its mining sector. Booming demand for its commodities from emerging markets such as China and India helped the country wade through the global financial crisis. However, a recent slowdown in growth in those economies has impacted the sector and as a result Australia's overall economic growth. At the same time, despite efforts by policymakers, non-mining sectors of the economy have not grown fast enough to offset the slowdown in mining. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the latest growth numbers were ""not good enough to deliver the jobs that people want"". Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said: ""The economy looks like it's still stuck in first gear."" ""Mining investment is coming off, maybe not as quickly as people have been worrying about, but it's that growth transition, the pick-up in the non-mining side, where the evidence is still mixed,"" he added. Growth boost? The numbers come just a day after Australia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low 2.75% The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last cut the rate in August, when it lowered borrowing costs by 0.25%. On Tuesday, the bank said ""the full effects of these decisions are still coming through"". Some analysts suggested that if growth continued to remain weak, the bank may be prompted to cut rates further to try to boost the economy. ""The RBA is obviously reluctant to cut further, but if you've got sub-trend growth and very well-behaved inflation, there's got to still be scope to move if necessary,"" said Ms Ong of RBC Capital Markets.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Motorola phone 'brazen copy' of iPhone X,"Many phone-makers have copied the look of the iPhone X, which has a smaller bezel around the screen and a ""notch"" at the top that houses a camera. However, reviewers said the new Motorola P30 was a ""brazen"" and ""egregious"" rip-off of Apple's flagship device. Lenovo, which owns the Motorola brand, has not yet responded to the criticism. Motorola was a pioneer in the mobile phone industry, but its sales fell in the smartphone era and its handset division was sold to Google in 2012. The division was then sold to Chinese computer firm Lenovo in 2014, where it has continued to produce smartphones running the Android operating system. Commenting on the similarity between the Motorola P30 and the iPhone X, technology blogger Marques Brownlee called it the ""most shameless rip yet"". News site Mashable said Motorola ""even went so far as to adorn the screen with a wallpaper that's a dead ringer for Apple's default wallpaper"". News and reviews site Technobuffalo said the design was an ""egregious clone"" that was ""nearly impossible to distinguish"" from the iPhone X. Tech news site The Verge pointed out that Google's image recognition algorithms described photos of the P30 as ""iPhone"". ""The growing number of identikit smartphone designs is a depressing trend and it's little wonder consumer apathy is on the rise and replacement rates are slowing,"" said analyst Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""One starts to wonder whether Jony Ive's design group at Apple has become the de facto owner for the reference design for all high-end smartphones. ""Phone makers need to innovate and find ways to differentiate if they want to maintain consumer desire to upgrade their phones,"" he told the BBC. On Thursday, Lenovo posted an operating profit for the first quarter - after making a loss the previous year. Bloomberg attributed the rise to an increase in sales, but also cost-cutting measures in its mobile division. Lenovo plans to sell the Motorola P30 in China, but has not announced its availability in other countries. The device is expected to cost about $350 (£275) - less than half the price of Apple's flagship device.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
State school numbers rise at Cambridge,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News family and education correspondent The university also says one in four are from ""disadvantaged backgrounds"". Cambridge has faced accusations of being socially exclusive and this year ran a scheme ensuring more places for poorer youngsters. Applicants have not been put off by ""false perceptions"", says director of admissions, Sam Lucy. Record numbers The official admission figures for 2019-20 will not be published until next year, but the university says the proportion of state school students among its UK intake will be the highest in records going back to the 1980s. Last year, about 65% of students starting at Cambridge were from state schools - but this year's figure has risen to 68%. Four years ago, there were 62% of students from state schools. This shift has seen Cambridge's intake, in terms of state-educated pupils, becoming more similar to other Russell Group universities. About 7% of pupils in England are in private schools - but that figure rises to more than 15% by sixth form. Leading universities have been under pressure to ensure fair access to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Access scheme For this year's intake, the university offered 100 places only available to deprived students. This provided a second chance for disadvantaged students who might have got better exam results than expected, and who could re-apply after they had their A-level grades. This has contributed to more students from poorer backgrounds going to Cambridge this year, with the university saying about one in four new students will be classified as disadvantaged. The university defines disadvantage using measurements such as the ""Index of Multiple Deprivation"" and whether students live in areas where not many people go to university. Cambridge says it wants this to rise to one in three new students coming from ""under-represented and disadvantaged"" backgrounds. The university does not have official figures yet for numbers of ethnic minority students beginning in the autumn, but says it expects a ""significant increase"". Dr Lucy, head of admissions, said: ""It is deeply encouraging to see that our actions to provide educational opportunity for all those who have the potential to study here are paying off."" She said the university wanted to ""make our student population truly representative of the UK population"". ""This has included challenging false perceptions that put off applicants.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Criticism over lack of detail on Lake Vyrnwy estate future,"Llanwddyn community council claims land owner Severn Trent has ignored requests for a public meeting on the water company's future strategy. But Severn Trent said it was developing a longer term plan which it would consult the local community about. The estate, valued at £11m, was withdrawn from the market in June 2013. The proposed sale of the estate was announced in 2010 - and was described as the biggest in living memory in Wales and England. A year later, United Utilities and RSPB Cymru were announced as preferred bidders for 12,000 acres of agricultural holdings on the estate, while FIM Sustainable Timber and Energy LP was named the preferred bidder to develop the 5,000 acres of commercial woodland. But United Utilities pulled out of the sale which led to Severn Trent Water taking all the land off the market in June 2013. Andrew Johnson, chair of Llanwddyn Community Council said: ""Since the sale fell through and the estate was taken off the market in May 2013 things have only got worse. ""There is no communication with the people that live and work in the area despite requests for a full public meeting."" The council has called on Severn Trent Water's chief executive, Liv Garfield, to visit Lake Vyrnwy to meet with the community. 'Community updated' Mr Johnson added: ""We are not looking for Severn Trent Water to spend millions of pounds, just to be fair to the people who live and work in the area relying on visitors to the estate. ""A clean, tidy, well-presented and managed estate working alongside and in partnership with existing organisations whilst encouraging investment and growth for one of Wales most natural and beautiful areas is all we ask."" But a spokesman for the water company said it continued to work with the local community in Lake Vyrnwy. ""There are long standing management and tenancy agreements in place which have not changed,"" said the spokesman. ""Since the estate was taken off the market, we have kept the community updated. ""Our aim is to make sure the estate continues to be a very special place to live, work and visit. ""The proposed meeting with the council was postponed because we're developing a longer term plan which we will invite the local community to consult on in the spring.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Apple design chief Jonathan Ive is knighted,"The 45-year-old said the investiture in front of the Princess Royal was ""really thrilling and particularly humbling"". Now based in the US, Apple's senior vice-president of industrial design flew in to the UK with his wife and eight-year-old twin sons for the event. He was born in Chingford, east London, and studied at Newcastle Polytechnic. Sir Jonathan had a brief chat with Princess Anne and later revealed they had talked about how often he comes back to the UK while she spoke of her iPad. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the New Year Honours list for services to design and enterprise. After graduating from Newcastle Polytechnic - now Northumbria University - Sir Jonathan began working as a commercial designer before founding design agency Tangerine with three friends. One of the agency's clients, Apple, was so impressed with his work it took him on as a full-time employee in 1992. Sir Jonathan, who now lives in San Francisco, has led the Apple design team since 1996. He was described by Steve Jobs as his ""spiritual partner"", according to the late Apple co-founder's biographer Walter Isaacson. His eye for design, combined with Mr Jobs' attention to detail, has helped to turn Apple into one of the biggest technology companies in the world. Over the past 15 years, the company has created a series of products which are all considered to be design classics. They include the iMac G3 - the ""Bondi blue"" computer launched in 1998 - and the iPod, released in 2001, which helped to revolutionise the music industry. Earlier, in a rare interview, Sir Jonathan told the Daily Telegraph he was ""the product of a very British design education"". He said that, ""even in high school, I was keenly aware of this remarkable tradition that the UK had of designing and making"". ""It's important to remember that Britain was the first country to industrialize, so I think there's a strong argument to say this is where my profession was founded."" ""We try to develop products that seem somehow inevitable, that leave you with the sense that that's the only possible solution that makes sense,"" Sir Jonathan told the Telegraph. Sir Jonathan said Apple products were tools ""and we don't want design to get in the way"". He was made a Commander of Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005. Other figures honoured by Princess Anne on Wednesday included Sir Peter Bazalgette, 59, of Endemol - the TV company behind Big Brother - who was knighted for services to broadcasting.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott to play free NHS concert,"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The duo, who recently scored a number one album with Manchester Calling, are giving away 9,000 tickets for the show in Nottingham in October. All NHS staff, including ""doctors, nurses, support workers, porters and cleaners"", will be welcome. Hospital staff ""can never be thanked enough"", said Heaton in a statement. ""The coronavirus pandemic should remind everyone, and let no-one forget, that our National Health Service is the most brilliant and significant institution in our lives. ""We are just musicians, so there is little we can do but sing for you. ""From the porters, the cleaners and the drivers, to the doctors and the nurses; thank you."" The show will take place at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena on Tuesday 13 October. Tickets will be made available from Tuesday 31 March and will be limited to two per person. Concertgoers will need to bring a valid NHS or Primary Care Trust ID card when they attend the show. Oasis reunion? Heaton and Abbott, who were formerly members of the Beautiful South, are not the only musicians offering support to the NHS. Liam Gallagher has even floated the idea of a one-off Oasis reunion in aid of frontline workers. ""Sick of pleading, begging, etc,"" he wrote on Twitter in a message apparently aimed at brother and former bandmate Noel. ""I demand an Oasis reunion after this is all over, all money going to NHS. C'mon, you know."" Touring company Vans for Bands has also volunteered to hand over its entire fleet of vehicles to the NHS during the coronavirus outbreak. ""We would like to offer our sleeper buses to be parked outside hospitals and used by doctors, nurses and staff to sleep/take a rest during their extended shifts,"" wrote chief executive Edward Thompson in an open letter. Meanwhile, pop star Peter Andre has praised his wife Emily MacDonagh, a junior doctor, and her colleagues for working tirelessly during the crisis. He shared a photo of the staff on her ward holding up signs reading: ""We stay here for you, please stay home for us,"" with the hashtag #supportthenhs. ""Thank you so much to ALL the NHS and the carers up and down the country,"" he added. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Jersey pair in 30-year search for Iron Age coins,"Reg Mead and Richard Miles began their hunt after a woman told them her father had found coins in a field some years before. But the woman could only give the pair a rough location for the discovery. And to complicate things further, the field's owner would only allow them to look for a short time each year after the crop was harvested. It meant that the two spent up to 15 hours at a time scouring the field - before they had to stop and wait again until the same time next year. However, their perseverance has paid off after they found the huge stash of Roman and Celtic coins, which could be worth £10m. Mr Mead said the woman told him her father was a farmer and he had discovered silver coins while ploughing a hedgerow. He said: ""She told me that in the bottom was an earthenware pot and it shattered all over the field on a very muddy winter's day and there were silver coins everywhere. ""They filled a small potato sack up and the rest of the stuff they just ploughed into the ground. ""When she described them we knew they were Iron Age. I told Richard and we have been searching hard all that time but have only just got to that spot."" Mr Miles said that the first few coins they found confirmed the story they had been searching for for so long. He said: ""We then looked deeper into the ground to see if there was anything further. We came down on a solid object and when Reg dug up a chunk of earth there was immediately five or six discs. ""We always said if we found anything significant it must remain in situ, it had to remain in its archaeological context so it could be studied."" The exact number of coins found has not been established, but archaeologists said the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain about 50,000 coins. Mr Mead said it had taken them 30 years to find the coins as they could only search for about 10 hours every time the crop comes out. He said it worked out at about 10-15 hours per year. He said: ""We have declared this hoard as the trove, treasure trove, which was an ancient law that gave you, if within a reasonable amount of time you declared them, the full monetary value. ""We are testing that case because the powers that be have said the practice of trove doesn't exist in Jersey any more."" Mr Mead said it was the first important find with metal detectors ever in Jersey. He said: ""There are two laws, in Jersey anyone who wants to follow the law can use the English or the old French. If they don't like the practice of trove then the old French law is finders keepers. ""Richard, myself and the land owner have an agreement between us, we are entitled to that hoard.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Britain First leader and deputy leader jailed for hate crimes,"Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 32, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. Both were jailed at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. Fransen was handed a 36-week sentence and Golding 18 weeks. During their trial in January, the court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. 'Hostility' towards Muslims They denied a total of seven counts of harassment. Judge Justin Barron threw out three of the charges, while Fransen was found guilty of three and Golding of one. He told the court the pair were ""well-known"", ""controversial"" and ""generate their own publicity"", but his verdict was based ""solely on admissible evidence heard in court"". He said their words and actions ""demonstrated hostility"" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. ""I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. ""It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants."" Both Fransen and Golding were convicted on a joint charge of religiously aggravated harassment after an incident last May at 555 Pizza takeaway in Ramsgate, when Fransen banged on the windows and doors of the shop and screamed ""paedophile"" and ""foreigner"". However, in each case, they instead targeted innocent members of the public. They filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the defendants lived. Giving evidence, Fransen had denied being a racist and said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences, while Mr Golding told the court he had often acted as her cameraman. Fransen was convicted of abuse after visiting a house she wrongly believed to be the current address of Sershah Muslimyar, a defendant in the trial. She was also convicted of visiting the Kent home of another defendant, Tamin Rahmani, and shouting racist abuse through the front door while his pregnant partner Kelli Best was there. During sentencing Fransen spoke over the judge, saying: ""This is a very sad day for British justice. Everything I did was for the children of this country and they are worth it."" As Britain First supporters left the courtroom they hurled abuse at court staff and members of the press, shouting ""no surrender"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Barclays reviewing currency trades,"It said it was co-operating with regulators in the inquiry, which comes on the heels of other scandals, including Libor rate-fixing. Regulators around the world, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, are investigating currency trading. The news came as the bank announced an increase in profits so far in 2013. In the first nine months of the year, it said pre-tax profits rose to £2.85bn, from £962m in the same period last year. ""Various regulatory and enforcement authorities have indicated they are investigating foreign-exchange trading, including possible attempts to manipulate certain benchmark currency exchange rates or engage in other activities that would benefit their trading positions,"" the bank said. ""The investigations appear to involve multiple market participants in various countries. ""Barclays Bank has received inquiries from certain of these authorities related to their particular investigations, is reviewing its foreign-exchange trading covering a several-year period through August 2013 and is co-operating with the relevant authorities in their investigations."" 'Third headache' Other institutions, such as Deutsche Bank and UBS, have already said they are involved in the investigation. Barclays added that it did not yet know what the legal and financial impact from the inquiry would be. The BBC's business editor Robert Peston says that this is the ""third such headache for Barclays, having already suffered penalties of £290m for rigging Libor interest-rate benchmarks and being subject to investigations into whether another important financial price, the so-called ISDAfix, has been manipulated"". Barclays, along with other international banks, has been fined for manipulation of the inter-bank lending rate Libor, a scandal which emerged in June 2012. In the case of Libor, there is also now a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Barclays also said that the amount that it had set aside to pay compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) was unchanged at £3.95bn. On Tuesday, Lloyds Bank said it would set aside another £750m for compensation for PPI mis-selling, taking the total to £8bn. In a statement, Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins said that he was ""not complacent"". He added: ""My executive team know we must push harder in the final quarter and into 2014.""

Coronavirus: Belfast's Lyric Theatre rules out 2020 reopening,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI arts correspondent Management told staff it had made the decision as there was ""no clarity"" yet over any financial support for venues. The theatre employs about 75 people as well as hundreds of freelance staff each year for its productions. In July, Northern Ireland received £33m as part of a UK government package for theatres, arts and music venues, museums and heritage sites. However, the Northern Ireland Executive has not yet decided how that money will be spent or when it will be released. 'Collapsed like dominoes' Theatres and venues have also not been given a date when they can re-admit audiences, and even when they return they are likely to be limited to ensure social distancing. In an email to staff, the Lyric's management said they had been able to furlough staff through the government's job retention scheme. However, they said that could not make up for £2m in income the theatre makes through its box office and cafe bar each year. ""At every stage of this pandemic, we have been working towards reopening the theatre in a safe and Covid compliant way for our wonderful audiences and brilliant artists,"" the message to staff said. ""But each carefully thought-out plan has collapsed like dominoes in the howl of the ill-wind of this pandemic. ""Times are indeed tough for everyone, and this sort of staggered planning is no longer possible or fiscally prudent."" Decision taken 'reluctantly' The message added: ""The Lyric has reluctantly come to the conclusion that this year, for the first time in our history, we will not be presenting our hugely popular and unique Christmas offerings. ""Therefore, we will not produce any work on our stages until 2021. ""This has implications for our staff, both permanent and casual workers, our audiences and, as the single largest employer of arts workers in NI, for hundreds of freelance artists we would normally employ.""

""We had hoped that clarity around the level of financial support to venues and production companies would have come much sooner,"" they said. ""No such clarity or timetable currently exists. We hope that will be quickly resolved."" The Lyric's patron Liam Neeson recently appealed to the executive to provide financial support to venues and the arts. A number of entertainment and arts venues across Northern Ireland have previously warned they face financial ""devastation"".

Views sought on Gatwick and London 'airspace motorway',"The National Air Traffic Control Service (NATS) wants to create an airspace network with planes flying on specific routes, similar to a motorway. It said the changes were needed to ensure safety levels and the new system would mean less noise for most people. But people under new flight-paths could experience more air traffic. NATS said the changes would reduce the amount of stacking - where aircraft circle while they wait for a landing slot - that took place, put more routes over the sea and cut CO2 emissions. Planes would climb higher on take-off and fly at a greater altitude for longer during landing. 'Noise footprint' Juliet Kennedy, operations director at NATS' Swanwick headquarters in Hampshire, said: ""The whole of the South East of England, pretty much, is already over flown by aircraft. ""What we're trying to do is to work out the best possible route structure which suits everybody, works best for the people who are living underneath the areas where the aircraft fly but also for the airlines who are flying them and enables us to meet the demands that are placed on us by all the people who want to fly."" She added: ""The airspace above London is the most complex in the world and, as traffic levels increase, change is necessary to ensure safety and service levels."" Jane Vogt, former chair of Dormansland Parish Council in Surrey, said: ""There's a certain amount of concentration of aircraft already and that in itself raises several questions, the impact on health, the moral issue and the environmental impact. ""We are surrounded here by an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB), to the south of the area is the South Downs. There is already visual impact from aviation and also noise and a lot of businesses within the AONB rely on tranquillity for their business."" Gatwick Airport said it was considering a scheme called ""rotating respite"", which would see flight-path routes switched on and off. Tom Denton, head of corporate responsibility at the airport, added: ""This project gives us an opportunity to further reduce the number of people affected by noise, as well as focus on further reducing CO2 emissions and air quality impacts. ""Therefore this is an important time for local people and those who live within our flight paths, who now have a once in a lifetime opportunity to give their feedback and influence the future of our airspace."" The consultation on the plans for airspace routes to and from Gatwick and London City airports runs from Tuesday until 21 January 2014.

RHI scandal: Boiler owners opposed to being publicly named,"By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent It is believed they will oppose plans to publicly name recipients and seek legal advice on any contract changes. The group, who met on Wednesday, are against publication of their details. This is due to the negative publicity some businesses received after details of their biomass installations were made public. The Economy Minister, Simon Hamilton, has plans which, he claims, could reduce a potential scheme overspend of hundreds of millions to ""effectively zero"". His officials have already written to boiler owners giving them until next Tuesday to agree to the publication of their names. In the letter, recipients were told the department was ""minded to publish the names"" in the ""interests of openness and transparency"". It is understood the group will represent only those who have signed up to the scheme in good faith and are operating it legitimately. They are writing to the Department of the Economy seeking a meeting ahead of any announcement of changes to the scheme. The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) chief executive, Wesley Aston, said it was advising members who availed of the scheme not to give permission for their names to be disclosed, unless audits have been carried out of their installation. ""Without the audit, farmers risk being criticised, without being able to show they acted within the terms of the scheme,"" he said. ""It is up to individuals to decide whether they give permission to be named - but we fear this is not about transparency but efforts to shift the focus from those who failed to safeguard the taxpayer."" The UFU said the ""vast majority"" of people using the scheme were doing so ""legitimately"". The RHI scheme was flawed from the start offering overgenerous subsidies over 20 years. A spike in applications in Autumn 2015 led to an over commitment that could cost the Northern Ireland taxpayers up to £490m over 20 years. The handling of the scandal has become a major political row that threatens to bring down Stormont. Sinn Féin has demanded that Mrs Foster stand aside pending an investigation. Mrs Foster has said she will not be standing down.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Japan ninja student gets top marks for writing essay in invisible ink,"Eimi Haga followed the ninja technique of ""aburidashi"", spending hours soaking and crushing soybeans to make the ink. The words appeared when her professor heated the paper over his gas stove. ""It is something I learned through a book when I was little,"" Ms Haga told the BBC. ""I just hoped that no-one would come up with the same idea."" Ms Haga has been interested in ninjas - covert agents and assassins in medieval Japan - since watching an animated TV show as a child. After enrolling at Mie University in Japan, the first-year student took a class in ninja history, and was asked to write about a visit to the Ninja Museum of Igaryu. ""When the professor said in class that he would give a high mark for creativity, I decided that I would make my essay stand out from others,"" she said. ""I gave a thought for a while, and hit upon the idea of aburidashi."" Ms Haga, 19, soaked soybeans overnight, then crushed them before squeezing them in a cloth. She then mixed the soybean extract with water - spending two hours to get the concentration right - before writing her essay with a fine brush on ""washi"" (thin Japanese paper). Once her words had dried, they became invisible. But, to ensure her professor didn't put the essay in the bin, she left a note in normal ink saying ""heat the paper"". Ninjas explained The professor, Yuji Yamada, told the BBC he was ""surprised"" when he saw the essay. ""I had seen such reports written in code, but never seen one done in aburidashi,"" he said. ""To tell the truth, I had a little doubt that the words would come out clearly. But when I actually heated the paper over the gas stove in my house, the words appeared very clearly and I thought 'Well done!' ""I didn't hesitate to give the report full marks - even though I didn't read it to the very end because I thought I should leave some part of the paper unheated, in case the media would somehow find this and take a picture."" As for the essay itself, Ms Haga said it had more style than substance. ""I was confident that the professor would at least recognise my efforts to make a creative essay,"" she said. ""So I wasn't really worried about getting a bad score for my essay - though the content itself was nothing special.""

Pacific castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga's health worsens,"Jose Salvador Alvarenga has returned to hospital in the Marshall Islands, where he was found a week ago. Mr Alvarenga said he left Mexico for a trip in a fibre-glass boat in December 2012 with a friend who died on board. The family of his younger friend say they want to speak to Mr Alvarenga to find out more about how their son died. Doctors at Majuro Hospital in the Marshall Islands' capital said Mr Alvarenga was too dehydrated to travel. ""We must consider his health, that he is fit to travel, and get the doctor's recommendation. We're hoping in the next three or four days,"" said Mexican embassy official Christian Clay Mendoza. Mr Alvarenga made a brief public appearance on Thursday, and correspondents say he looked weaker than when he made his first media appearance on Monday. An unnamed official told AP that he looked much less animated. ""He looked exhausted, frankly. Like someone who has run two or three marathons."" He was rescued on Thursday by people living on the island of Ebon Atoll. Mr Alvarenga apparently survived the 8,000 km (5,000-mile) ordeal by catching fish, birds and turtles with his bare hands. For fluids, he claimed to have drunk urine, rainwater and the blood of birds. Alvarenga's fishermen colleagues told AFP that he had always had an unusual diet. ""He wasn't picky. He ate everything"" said one. Family seek answers The family of Mr Alvarenga's companion on the boat have also spoken out, saying they need more answers. Known as Ezequiel, he is believed to have starved after being unable to eat raw birds and fish. Romeo Cordova Rios, Ezequiel's brother, said that while the death was an accident, the family still wanted to speak to Mr Alvarenga. ""We want him to come here, for the government to bring him here,"" he said. ""The only thing we want is to know what was the last thing that he told this man and what he did with my brother's body,"" he added. Three Mexican fishermen were rescued off the Marshall Islands in August 2006 after what they said was about nine months drifting across the Pacific Ocean. They survived on rain water, seabirds and fish. Castaways from Kiribati, to the south, frequently find land in the Marshall Islands after ordeals of weeks or months at sea in small boats.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London Bridge terrorist-hiring head teacher struck off,"Sophie Rahman, 43, took on Butt as a volunteer ""Arabic memorisation teacher"" at Eton Community School, formerly Ad-Deen Primary School, in Ilford. Butt told children non-Muslims were the ""worst creatures"" and that lying to their parents was ""OK"". A panel found Ms Rahman guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. 'Worst creatures' Ms Rahman confirmed the last day Butt taught the children was 2 June 2017. The next day, the 27-year-old, along with Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed a van into people on London Bridge before launching a knife rampage around Borough Market. The attackers were shot dead by police officers. The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) found Butt could have taught up to three classes a week at the independent Muslim school, which shut in August last year. One eight-year-old girl reported Butt saying ""the worst creatures are the Kuffar [non-believers]"", the TRA said. He also told children it was OK to lie to their parents if ""they do not want to upset them"" or when ""there is a state of war,"" according to the report. In evidence, the girl's mother said: ""Mention of the word 'war' really alarmed me - if that is what Mr Butt was teaching there is no doubt he was referring to Jihad [holy war]."" The TRA said Ms Rahman should have known Butt was linked to members of banned terror-group Al-Muhajiroun. ""By her failure to safeguard her pupils' interests, Ms Rahman left them potentially vulnerable to grooming for radicalisation,"" the report said. In the wake of the London Bridge attack, which left eight innocent people dead, Ms Rahman emailed the local authority stating Butt had contact with six children on a weekly basis at an after-school club. But the panel said she should have known the number was more than six and criticised her delay in providing the details. A panel found Ms Rahman's conduct amounted to ""misconduct of a serious nature"" and that she was ""guilty of unacceptable professional conduct"". Department for Education official Alan Meyrick ordered she should be barred from the teaching profession for life. She has 28 days to appeal against the decision.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Miss Wales pageant entry rules 'not fit for 21st Century',"By Alex Jennings BBC News Sarah Sweeney, of the Women's Equality Network (WEN) Wales said entry rules were ""not fit for the 21st Century"". Entrants to the competition must be between 16 and 26 years old, be unmarried and have never had children. Organiser Paula Abbandonatto said she wants to create a ""feminist army"" and sees it as her ""duty"" to empower the contestants. She added there were other pageants available if women fell outside of the Miss Wales rules. Ms Sweeney, project officer at WEN Wales, said: ""There's dual discrimination where you treat women unfavourably because of pregnancy and because of their age and this obviously sends out negative messages to women and girls all over Wales. ""As a feminist organisation, we aren't in favour of this type of competition, but we understand and respect a woman's choice to enter a beauty pageant such as Miss Wales."" The 2019 competition took place on Saturday and was won by Gabriella Jukes from Port Talbot. The 22-year-old said the final had been a ""celebration of who we are"". Miss Wales, a franchise of the Miss World pageant, has been running since the 1950s and about 1,000 women and girls apply each year, with the winner guaranteed a place at the worldwide competition. Contestants this year raised funds for the Miss World charity Beauty With A Purpose, as well as taking part in the International Women's Day #BalanceforBetter campaign. Ms Abbandonatto said she wants to create an army of feminist role models ""parading around Wales, showing girls how to live their best life"". She said contestants are given an empowerment workshop and the competition is a ""journey in personal development"". She added: ""It wouldn't take a lot of Googling to find a pageant for every age, every shape, every size. So we're not the only one. If you want to be in a beauty pageant you can be, whether you're married or not."" In 1974, Miss Wales winner Helen Morgan went on to win Miss World, but resigned a few days later after admitting she had an 18-month- old son back home in Barry. Speaking at the time, Miss Morgan said it had been a ""great strain"" but ""had to come out in the open"". Miss World has been asked to comment.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wylfa: Last day for Anglesey nuclear plant,"The nuclear plant has been generating electricity since 1971. The remaining Reactor One at the site was switched off on Wednesday afternoon. About 150 staff are expected to lose their jobs by April 2016 as the power station starts the decommissioning process. It will take about three years to remove the remaining spent fuel at Wylfa before teams move in to clear much of the site. That process will end in about 2026 when only the reactor buildings and fuel stores will remain. The whole area will then be left until final site clearance at the start of the next century in 2105. Site director Stuart Law said he was immensely proud of what the power station had achieved in 44 years - providing enough electricity to power every single home in Wales, for every year it has been generating. ""Wylfa has been a fantastic story,"" he said. ""It's sad that we've reached the end - sad - but a real pleasure and honour to have had this role at Wylfa, and to take it as far as we have done."" By mid-2020s, all the remaining 500 posts at the plant will have gone, with many hoping that construction on a new nuclear plant - Wylfa Newydd - is well under way. Horizon Nuclear Power, owned by the Japanese giant Hitachi, is still in the process of drawing up detailed plans, which will be submitted by 2017. The new reactor designs from Hitachi still need approving by industry and government safety experts, and vocal opposition campaigns on the island mean a public inquiry is likely. 'Terrific success story' However, if the reactor and plant designs are agreed, the first concrete at Wylfa Newydd could be poured in 2020, with the plant generating electricity before the middle of the decade. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said: ""Today's shutdown and subsequent reduction in staff numbers has been known about for a number of years and the Welsh government has been working in partnership with Magnox, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the local authority to prepare for this. ""While today marks the end of one era it is also the start of new one for the island and the wider north Wales economy. ""Wylfa Newydd will present significant new employment and supply chain opportunities."" Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Wylfa had been a ""terrific success story for Anglesey and for the UK nuclear industry"". ""The safe operation of the reactor over its lifespan is testament to the hard work of its skilled and dedicated workforce,"" he said. Anglesey council leader Ieuan Williams said: ""Wylfa Newydd looks like a fitting successor to Wylfa and the long-term future is looking bright for Anglesey and beyond.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Germany's Jews urged not to wear kippahs after attacks,"Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told Berlin public radio that Jews should exercise caution in big cities. His comments come ahead of a ""Berlin Wears Kippah"" solidarity march in the German capital on Wednesday. Last week, two young men wearing kippahs were assaulted in the city. The attacker was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. Jewish organisations in Germany have expressed alarm over a number of recent anti-Semitic insults and threats in schools. At the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned what she described as ""another form of anti-Semitism"". She told Israel's Channel 10 TV network that aside from anti-Semitism by right-wing groups, similar threats were coming from some Muslim refugees in the country. What did Josef Schuster say? ""Defiantly showing your colours would in principle be the right way to go [to tackle anti-Semitism],"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I would advise individual people against openly wearing a kippah in big German cities,"" Mr Schuster added. But he also stressed that if Germans refused to stand up to anti-Semitism ""our democracy would be at risk"". ""This is not only about anti-Semitism - it goes along with racism, it goes along with xenophobia. You need a clear stop sign here."" What about reaction from other groups? Mr Schuster's comments apparently contradict the position taken on the kippah issue by the Berlin-based Jewish Forum for Democracy and Against Anti-Semitism - the organisation which shared video of last week's attack on Facebook. ""I used to always advise my Jewish friends and acquaintances not to wear a kippah so as not to show their Jewish identity. I changed my opinion,"" a spokesman said last week. ""We must take up this fight and be visible again in public."" Separately, the head of Germany's Central Council of Muslims condemned recent anti-Semitic attacks. ""Anti-Semitism, racism and hatred are great sins in Islam, therefore we will also never tolerate that,"" Aiman Mazyek told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. Germany's Jewish population has grown rapidly since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before 1989, the population was below 30,000 but an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wiseman agrees to Muller takeover,"Wiseman confirmed last week it was in talks with Muller after a sharp rise in its share price. The Scottish group operates seven dairies across the UK and counts the The Co-operative Group, Sainsbury's and Tesco among its customers. Muller is based in Germany and makes yoghurts and potted desserts. East Kilbride-based Wiseman provides about 30% of the fresh milk consumed in the UK every day. The recommended cash offer of 390p per share is 60% above the value at close of Robert Wiseman's shares on Thursday - a day before the start of the offer. The deal means the Wiseman family, which owns 35% of the company, will receive a total of £98m. Exactly half of that sum will go to executive chairman Robert Wiseman, while his brother Alan will get £35m. Dairy farmer co-operative First Milk, which owns 10% of Wiseman, will receive £27.9m. Significant stake Robert Wiseman said: ""The combination of Muller and Wiseman makes strong commercial and strategic sense, creating a leading integrated dairy business in the United Kingdom with complementary positions in the yoghurt and potted desserts market and the fresh milk market. ""Wiseman has its origins as a family business and, since listing in 1994, my family has retained a significant stake in the business. It is heartening to know that the business will become part of another family-owned business in Müller."" Muller is a multi-national producer of dairy products and is based in Bavaria. It is best known for its range of yoghurts, including the trademark Muller Corner yoghurt. The headquarters of Muller Dairy (UK) Ltd is in Market Drayton in Shropshire. Heiner Kamps, chief executive of Muller, said: ""This is an exciting strategic move by Muller to enter a new market segment in the UK. The combination of these complementary businesses will form a leading dairy player offering a range of exceptional products to our customers across the UK. ""This will create significant opportunities which will benefit suppliers, customers, consumers and employees."" 'Guarantees needed' Michael McCann, Labour MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, said guarantees were needed that the takeover would not lead to job losses. He added: ""I am seeking to meet the company, union and workforce in the coming days to help in any way I can."" Central Scotland Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, who is based in East Kilbride, said she had written to Robert Wiseman to ask for more information about the proposed takeover. She added: ""The deal is as good as done but I want to make sure that the future of company's workforce is secure.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Liverpool's Commonwealth Games bid includes floating pool,"The 50m pool structure, with seating for 5,000 spectators, would be built on the water near Albert Dock. The bid, which also includes events at both Everton's existing and proposed new stadiums, would see some events held in Greater Manchester. Liverpool faces competition from Birmingham to be England's official bid for the games. The pool, which would be fixed to the walls of a dock but rest on the water, would become a public lido after the games. The city's waterfront venues - including the conference centre and Pier Head - would host a wide range of events, including weightlifting, judo, netball, road cycling and the pole vault, long jump and triple jump, though the majority of the athletics would be staged at Everton's new Bramley Moore Dock stadium. The football club's existing ground, Goodison Park, would host boxing, while across Stanley Park - which itself would see lawn bowls - Liverpool's Anfield would stage the opening ceremony and the rugby sevens. 'Innovative and inspiring' The details of Liverpool's bid were unveiled in a presentation featuring local Commonwealth stars, including gymnastics gold medallist Beth Tweddle, swimmer Steve Parry, and three-time boxing medallist Tony Bellew. Parry said his home city would be ""the perfect host"" and described the pool plan as ""an absolute knockout"". Greater Manchester's National Squash Centre, Old Trafford cricket ground and Manchester Velodrome would host squash, T20 cricket and track cycling. The latter two events are part of the Liverpool bid's ""optional sports"", events which the host city chooses to be part of the programme alongside a minimum of 10 ""core sports"". Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said the city's Commonwealth pedigree and its ""elite sporting venues"" meant the authority was ""pleased to be able to assist Liverpool in its quest to deliver an inclusive, innovative and inspiring games"". Bid judges will visit Liverpool in July and a final decision on where the games will be held will be made before the end of the year. The Commonwealth Games Federation has been searching for a new host for the 2022 games since it decided in March that Durban had not met the criteria for hosting.

"Brexit: Don't put bankers first in talks, says Labour","By Rob YoungBusiness reporter Discussions over the UK's post-Brexit trading framework with the EU are expected to begin later this year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was clear the government aimed to ""win a deal for financial services first and then worry about the rest of the economy later"". The chancellor has argued for a post-Brexit deal to include banking. On Wednesday, Philip Hammond said: ""A trade deal will only happen if it is fair and balances the interests of both sides. ""Given the shape of the British economy, and our trade balance with the EU27, it is hard to see how any deal that did not include services could look like a fair and balanced settlement."" John McDonnell said that showed the government was favouring financial services, such as banking and trading, over other parts of the economy. Speaking to the British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) annual conference in London, Mr McDonnell said: ""There is no other reason to raise a specific deal for financial services, even if it is as bad and fantastical as proposed, while just last week refusing to negotiate a new customs union that would protect our manufacturing trade."" Goods v services A spokesperson for the Chancellor said, ""It's plainly ridiculous to suggest the Chancellor has anything other than the best interests of the whole economy at heart."" ""As he made clear in his speech yesterday, the UK financial services hub is an engine that powers the real economy not just in London, but across the UK."" Labour has said the inclusion of financial services in a trade deal is a ""red line"" for Labour, so the criticism appears to be one of emphasis. Financial services are important to the UK - the sector employs more than two million people and paid £70bn in tax last year, according to lobby group The City UK and accountancy giant PwC. But when it comes to trade with the EU, the picture is less clear cut. The UK sells more financial services to the rest of the EU than it buys. Exports were worth £27bn in 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. So it's big, but it's not as large as goods sales to the EU. They were worth much more, at £145bn. However, we buy more products from the EU than we sell there. Britain's exports of services to the EU have grown in recent years, whereas sales of products have fallen. At the moment, this discussion is moot. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has resisted the inclusion of banking in a post-Brexit arrangement, saying a trade deal including financial services ""does not exist"". The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, told the BCC's conference the UK should not be penalised for leaving the EU. ""The idea of punishing Britain to me is not the language of a club, it is the language of a gang,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Uzbekistan: Is 'pop star' president's daughter in power struggle?,"As seen by......Uzbek sources on media disruption Three of the channels are said to have links to Gulnara Karimova, the president's millionaire daughter who styles herself as charity crusader and fashion designer, makes pop videos and once sang with actor Gerard Depardieu. Their continued absence - followed by three radio stations falling silent on Thursday - led Radio Liberty's Uzbek service, Ozodlik, to suggest they were switched off at autocratic President Islam Karimov's behest ""to keep a tighter rein"" on his daughter. Karimova's been in a war of words with her sister, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, who recently said they'd not spoken for 12 years, adding: ""There are no family or friendly relations between us."" Gulnara retorted that her younger sibling - Uzbek ambassador to UN cultural organisation Unesco - was ""friends with sorcerers"". Opposition website Uznews reported that Gulnara had also expressed concern about her mother performing ""strange rituals"". On top of this, she blamed hackers for the four-day disappearance of her usually highly-active Twitter account, which has almost 40,000 followers. Previously, she'd accused ""envious"" people of rendering it inaccessible. Journalist Farrux Yusufi told News Asia the broadcasters' closure could be punishment for her comments, adding that her actions were ""going beyond the interests of the president's associates"". Much of Karimova's publicity revolves around her Fund Forum charity, which reportedly helps hospitals, schools and needy families. Forum TV is almost entirely dedicated to reporting on its activities. A channel spokesman told Kun.uz website it had gone off air for maintenance. However, there'd been no warning of a scheduled outage and some Uznews sources reckon the broadcasters' disappearance marks the ""intensification of a political struggle"", with PM Shavkat Mirziyoyev and deputy Rustam Azimov. Three channels had been ""constantly running... advertisements"" for Gulnara's extravagent Style.uz art week event in Tashkent, ""much to the annoyance of viewers"", Uznews reports. It says calls to them are either left unanswered or picked up by security guards, while a security officer for one said there'd been an order from above to ""clean up their act"". Meanwhile, state TV has started completely ignoring the art week. To add to Karimova's woes, singer Lara Fabian - the global star booked to bring down art week's curtain - cancelled, saying she didn't want to be a ""shop-window"" for a regime accused of rights abuses.

Poland hosts landmark European gay pride,"It was the first time the annual EuroPride march was being held in Central or Eastern Europe. Several small counter-demonstrations were also held and some people hurled eggs and abuse at those in the parade. A BBC correspondent says gay people in staunchly Roman Catholic Poland find it hard to be open about their sexuality. Church leaders and politicians regularly speak out against homosexuality, Adam Easton reports from Warsaw. EuroPride's organisers say they want to fight discrimination against homosexuality and promote a debate about legalising same-sex relationships in Poland. Vuvuzelas and drums The colourful parade began to the sound of pounding drums and vuvuzelas, our correspondent says. Floats covered in rainbow flags and balloons carried politicians from Poland and across Europe. One person was dressed in a devil mask and horns - a cheeky reference, perhaps, to the controversy this year's EuroPride has caused in Poland, our correspondent says. ""We feel like they are 20 years behind the Netherlands,"" said Ad Bakker, a 39-year-old from Holland who travelled to Warsaw to show solidarity with Polish friends. ""But the atmosphere is good and we hope that EuroPride will help,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. A Polish friend of his, Sebastian Blaszczyk, 36, said the situation was improving every year but Poland still had far to go in accepting gay people. While EuroPride's organisers had hoped a minimum of 20,000 people from across Europe would join the event, police estimates put the figure at several thousand. By comparison, more than a million people attended a gay pride march in Madrid three years ago, our correspondent adds. Warsaw's authorities were given a petition with more than 50,000 signatures from anti-gay groups demanding the cancellation of the event. British solidarity In a recent survey, almost two-thirds of respondents said homosexual couples should not be open about their sexuality. It is extremely rare to see gay couples holding hands even in Warsaw, Poland's most cosmopolitan city, our correspondent says. Those who do face verbal or physical violence, such as Ryszard Giersz, 25, from a small town near the German border. He won a small amount of damages in court last year after neighbours repeatedly verbally abused him and threw tomatoes and stones at him. The UK's ruling Conservative Party sent its most senior openly gay member to the event. Nick Herbert told the BBC his presence at the parade illustrated Britain's support for human rights. ""Equality, respect for human rights, is fundamental for the ethos of the European Union and I think it's entirely appropriate and right that the British Government should be represented here by me and the ambassador in saying that we stand full square behind these values,"" he said. Mr Herbert said his party and its coalition partner the Liberal Democrats had a ""really ambitious programme of reform and entrenching equality for LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] people"".

"Rowley Regis dog attack: Woman, 85, killed by dogs that got through fence hole","The victim, who has been named as Lucille Downer, suffered a ""sustained"" attack and was found with serious injuries in Rowley Regis on Friday. She was a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother and her ""family will miss her dearly"", relatives said. Supt Phil Asquith said her death was ""tragic and horrific"". A 43-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being the person in charge of a dog dangerously out of control. He has been bailed while inquiries continue and the dogs are being tested to establish their breed, West Midlands Police said. Mrs Downer's family, who released their statement through the force, said she was born in Jamaica and emigrated to the UK in her early 20s. ""Since arriving in the UK, Rowley Regis has always been her home and her family will miss her dearly,"" they said. She had spent her working years as a cook at a care home in West Bromwich. Flowers have been placed in her driveway in Boundary Avenue, with one displaying the message ""RIP Nan"". Supt Asquith, of West Midlands Police, told a press conference earlier that neighbours and family who live nearby responded ""very quickly"" after the dogs escaped from a neighbouring property. ""The dogs will have unfortunately carried out a fairly sustained attack so there were multiple injuries, mainly caused as a result of the delay in getting into the garden,"" he said. He said officers were called to the scene at about 15:20 BST by neighbours who said she was ""under attack from dogs from a neighbouring property"". ""Our officers attended, by which point the dogs had returned through a hole in the fence to the adjacent property and then, unfortunately, despite the best efforts of medical professionals, that lady died at the scene,"" he said. The dogs were tranquilised and transported to secure kennels where they were being tested to determine their breed. Supt Asquith described the dogs as ""large"" but would not speculate on whether or not they were banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, adding DNA samples had been taken from them. ""Fortunately, these types of incidents are rare,"" he said. ""This presented no wider threat to the public. It was a hole in adjacent premises so they weren't running in the streets.""

Primark fire: Cordon leads to £152k loss for Translink,"By Colm KelpieBBC News NI The preliminary figure is based on year-on-year data for Metro services in north Belfast for the nine weeks immediately after the Primark cordon was put in place. The area has been closed for three months since the fire in August. The number of shoppers in Belfast city centre dipped in the wake of the blaze. Figures released for October revealed a 60% decline in the city's footfall compared with the same month in 2017. A temporary walkway opened in the city centre on Monday, allowing eight businesses that have been closed since the fire on 28 August to resume trading. Significant decline A report, prepared by Belfast City Council for its City Growth and Regeneration Committee, noted that the public transport network had been ""significantly impacted"" by the fire, with all routes that operated through Castle Place now diverted and temporary bus stop locations in operation throughout the city. A Translink spokesperson told BBC News NI the cordon had led to a ""significant decline in passenger journeys"", particularly from north Belfast, in the first month after the fire. Up to the week beginning 5 November, Translink suffered ""a loss in revenue of £152,000 due to a reduction in passenger journeys (29,000) and additional costs associated with the diversionary routes"", the spokesperson added. The Belfast City Council report also noted that punctuality on some northbound services was operating at just over 80%, compared with other Metro routes at between 87% and 90%, and the Glider at 94%. In November, Translink, with extra funding from the Department for Infrastructure, rolled out a fare incentive scheme to attract more people to shop and socialise in Belfast over Christmas. It included offering £2 fares and midnight services. ""Our festive fares package for Belfast has already seen a great response from the public with a considerable increase in the number of people choosing bus and train options during its first full week,"" Translink said. Belfast City Council has £6m to spend on promoting the city centre in the wake of the fire, including £1.1m from Stormont. Primark will reopen in Belfast city centre on 8 December at a new location - Commonwealth House. The retailer was extending into Commonwealth House at the time of the fire.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
eBay antique dealer faked signatures of public figures,"Allan Formhals, 66, of Milford on Sea in Hampshire, was found guilty of eight counts of fraud and two of possessing articles for the use in fraud. He was cleared of two counts of fraud and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on three further counts. The charges related to signatures from the likes of Churchill and Picasso. The three charges the jury failed to reach a decision on at Southampton Crown Court will lie on file, the judge said. Mr Formhals was too ill to appear at court on Thursday. A previous hearing in Southampton heard Formhals had found books at car boot sales and a recycling centre and added the fake signatures. Expert's opinion The court was told he lied to collectors, from as far afield as Texas in the US, about the provenance of the items. Collector Kim Taylor-Smith bought 68 signed books and documents bearing Winston Churchill's fake signature for about £10,000, prosecutor Simon Edwards said. Formhals told him the books came from the estate of the late Neville Duke, a famous World War II fighter pilot who lived in Milford on Sea. However, in November 2010, Mr Taylor-Smith had some of his items examined by an expert in Churchill books and was told they were forgeries. ""A number of items were left with him overnight. He called Mr Taylor-Smith the next day with the ghastly news that each and every Churchill signature was a fake,"" Mr Edwards said. Police also found the forged signatures of JRR Tolkien, Oliver Cromwell, Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette at Formhal's home, the court was told. Mr Edwards said that when interviewed Formhals told officers he got the books from Wimborne and Matchams car boot sales in Dorset, and denied being responsible for the signatures. ""He said he was not an expert on books and advertised them as signed, as opposed to signed by,"" he said. ""He believed them to be genuine but he did not advertise them for sale as such or guarantee them as such."" Mr Formhals denied all charges against him, which related activity between 2009 and 2011.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish food and drink export sales 'on target',"The prediction was based on a survey of 100 companies with a current estimated turnover of £6bn. However, the research also showed a slow take-up of online selling in the sector, both in the UK and foreign markets. It suggested two-thirds of food and drink firms did not trade online. The overall survey findings are in line with recent predictions by industry body Scotland Food and Drink, which said a previous target of £5bn had been achieved six years early. Its latest target, if met, would bring the sector's exports close to the value of oil and gas from Scotland, which currently stands at £7.6bn. The Lloyds report canvassed opinions from companies covering beverages, fresh produce, manufactured goods and artisan brands. About half of the firms believed that product heritage was key to attracting buyers. However, only about one in eight (13%) shipped products internationally from orders placed online, while 23% sold online but only to the UK market. Alasdair Gardner, from Lloyds Bank, said: ""Scotland boasts some of the finest natural resources in the world and its produce is synonymous with quality. ""Our research indicates that the industry, which is already a key engine of the Scottish economy, could be on the brink of a golden age where export-driven growth will see it move through the gears, and could soon rival oil and gas as Scotland's greatest export market."" James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said that in recent years Scotland had exported more food to Belgium than to the whole of Asia. He continued: ""The scale of the international opportunities is huge and it's encouraging that despite continuing economic uncertainty, so many Scottish food and drink businesses are clearly moving forward with their exporting plans across such a diverse range of markets."" 'Mood of optimism' Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said the report showed why there was a ""mood of optimism and opportunity"" among Scottish food and drink producers. ""Scotland's food and drink industry already makes a tremendous contribution to our economy - it is now our fastest growing sector - and we are keen to build on that which is why we have recently set a new target aiming to grow the value of food and drink sent abroad to £7.1bn in just five years. ""While these targets are ambitious and stretching I'm confident that our food and drink sector is more than up to the challenge, particularly given the strong performance we have seen to date and the interest we are seeing in important emerging markets such as the Middle East and China."" Meanwhile, a survey of small businesses backed by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) and Strathclyde Business School has found that only 10% of respondents made extensive use of digital technology and had a clear digital strategy to support their internationalisation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Global spam e-mail drops after hacker arrests,"Figures compiled by security firm Symantec show that the amount of junk e-mail messages flowing around the net has dropped 47% in three months. Kaspersky Labs noted a similar fall from July to September, when spam levels fell to 81.1% of all e-mails The decline was put down to the arrests of those behind spam-sending botnets, and intelligence work that saw other spamming systems shut down. Server shutdown In the last few months security firms have scored several notable successes against gangs that own and operate botnets - collections of hijacked home computers. The vast majority of spam or junk mail is routed through these hijacked machines. One of the biggest successes was against the Pushdo or Cutwail botnet, which had been in operation since 2007 and was thought to be sending about 10% of global spam. An international operation co-ordinated by the security firm LastLine managed to get 20 of the 30 servers controlled by the group shut down. The servers were turned off with the help of the internet service providers unwittingly found to be hosting them. As a result, many of the ""drone"" PCs in the huge botnet used to send e-mail were cut off and no longer relayed the junk messages. Bredolab was another big botnet hit in October thanks to work by the hi-tech division of the national crime squad in the Netherlands. The arrest of an Armenian man thought to be the botnet's controller led to the closure of the 143 servers linked to Bredolab. At its height Bredolab was thought to involve up to 30 million computers around the world and be capable of sending 3.6 billion e-mails every day. Police forces also took action against many of the people involved in the Zeus botnet. Around the world about 100 people were arrested and many of the command and control machines overseeing the network were turned off. Spammers were also hit by the September closure of the Spamit partner program. It paid spam senders to promote its Canadian Pharmacy network of sites peddling fake pills. Action against botnets and the closure of Spamit led spam volumes to drop to 86.8% of all e-mail, the lowest percentage since September 2009, said Symantec. However, Kaspersky analyst Darya Gudkova warned that there was bad news mixed in with the good. ""Spam is becoming a greater threat as it now frequently contains a variety of malicious attachments and links to infected websites,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Parasite becomes UK's most successful international film,"The winner of the best picture Oscar has taken a total of £11.5m at the box office since its release on 7 February.

Diamond Jubilee: How did London's transport system cope?,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter Transport for London (TfL) certainly seem pretty pleased with how it has gone so far. The main reason is that Londoners listened to the messages that they put out - i.e don't drive into central London. That means traffic was 40% down on a normal Sunday. Passengers on public transport went up 25%. Some Tube stations switched to exit only as would be expected but there were other issues. For example St James' station had a problem with platform equipment and had to close. Also repairs to the London Overground took all day after a power failure. That will be a concern, as the speed of recovery will be vital during the Olympics. But in the main it seems the Tube and roads coped pretty well. Not prepared The train companies fared a lot worse. Many simply were not prepared for the numbers of travellers on the Sunday. Some ran only an enhanced Sunday service; trains, unsurprisingly, were packed. There are bound to be questions now about how the train companies came to the conclusion that an enhanced Sunday service could cope. Who did the modelling? On what were the numbers based? Did the train companies engage with the Met Police and TfL who seemed to correctly predict the numbers? Was the lack of capacity a financial decision? A spokesperson for the Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said: ""There were extra services and extra carriages to get people to and from London yesterday. ""But operators have to make a call on how many services to run based on projected demand well in advance. ""Clearly in instances where overcrowding did cause problems, operators would apologise to passengers."" The lack of capacity on rail meant crowd control systems were implemented at a number of mainline stations. Expect to see much more of that this summer. And remember the Olympics will be a much bigger test of the transport system spread over two weeks. The key message will be to avoid the hot spots and use less busy routes. Transport chiefs did not want to call it publicly a dry run for the Olympics - but it was. Am I being fair? Let me know your experiences.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dale Farm eviction: Residents prepare for confrontation,"Protesters have wedged two cars and a Russian military truck behind the entrance and said three people will chain themselves to the gate at dawn on Wednesday. Earlier, Basildon Council officials met travellers at the police compound at Barleylands near the site. The talks broke down after 10 minutes. It had been an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully but Grattan Puxon, of the Gypsy Council, claimed Basildon Council was unwilling to negotiate and was ""mustering police and bailiffs"" to begin the eviction at 08:30 BST on Wednesday. Fall in numbers Basildon Council leader Tony Ball said the travellers had unrealistic expectations about the meeting, which was about ""how"" the eviction should take place, and not a negotiation about ""if and when"". A council spokesman said it would be ""moving resources into a compound on the site"" in preparation for the clearances. Several caravans had been crammed on to the few plots which the bailiffs cannot touch, a spokesman for the residents said. The number of supporters inside the site has fallen from more than 100 a month ago, when the council was first expected to begin the clearance, to fewer than 50. A similar number of travellers remain in their homes. On Monday, residents were refused permission to appeal against a High Court ruling giving Basildon Council the go-ahead to evict them. Travellers had asked for leave to appeal against a decision to allow the council to clear 49 plots. Lord Justice Sullivan, at the Court of Appeal, said they could not challenge the decision by Mr Justice Ouseley. Mr Ball added: ""We now believe that those who want to leave peacefully have already done so and those who are left have made it clear that they have no intention of co-operating with the council. ""Resistance and violence as some are now suggesting will be in nobody's interest - especially not the travellers or their families. ""We now must get on with the difficult job of clearing Dale Farm in as safe and dignified a manner as possible - and that is what we will now do."" Harlow council in Essex has begun to dig trenches around its parkland after information suggested travellers evicted from Dale Farm could move there. The authority said it had a good relationship with local travellers, but it needed to protect green spaces.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Popcorn Time's app is seen by Netflix as a threat - here's how,"Now Netflix has also got a problem with them and has singled out one - Popcorn Time. In a lengthy letter to shareholders, Netflix made a mention of the site as an example of how piracy continues to be one of its ""biggest competitors"". Here's how this particular app is making bosses at Netflix worried. Popcorn Time is an app which streams films and television programmes using torrents. According to data from TorrentFreak, a website which specialises in copyright and privacy news, ""Popcorn Time is very popular in the UK where it's been installed on hundreds of thousands of computers"". The founder of TorrentFreak, known only as ""Ernesto"", says the app is particularly threatening ""because its easy-to-use user interface appeals to a mainstream audience"". Even though it may be easier to use Popcorn Time compared to other sites for torrent-streaming, it is just as illegal. ""Copyright holders have tried to make the app unavailable several times,"" says Ernesto. ""The major movie studios pressured the original developers to shut their project down, which they did. ""However, since the code is open source it was quickly picked up by others."" He says Popcorn Time now has a user base of millions worldwide. This supports some Google research identified by Netflix, which shows that, in the Netherlands at least, there has been a dramatic increase of people searching for the title of the app. Netflix described this data as ""sobering"". Netflix has been working to develop its own content, with productions including House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey. Bosses at the streaming site also identified other legal operations that it perceives as competitors, including HBO Go, Hulu and Amazon Prime. Some users of Netflix in the UK and elsewhere have been trying to use work-arounds to access the US version of the site - which has a different library of video. Although the company is trying to crack down on these loopholes, they have yet to solve the problem. Popcorn Time, as an illegal site, doesn't have any rights agreements with studios and producers and does not have to block content on the basis of users' location.

Banham Poultry factory staff test positive for Covid-19,"Tests were carried out on 347 staff at Banham Poultry in Attleborough, Norfolk, after seven caught the virus. The county's director of public health, Dr Louise Smith, said this was ""now being regarded as a significant national outbreak"". Staff from the cutting area of the factory have been asked to go into isolation along with their households. Dr Smith said: ""The action has been taken because we believe it is the best way to protect the wider public from further infection."" The source of the outbreak is not yet known but a geographic or town based lockdown was not anticipated at this stage, Dr Smith said. Other areas of the processing plant would remain open for now, although the outbreak would be reviewed by central government on Thursday. At least one factory worker had been taken to hospital but their condition was unknown. Banham Poultry has been working with the council's public health department and had ""voluntarily agreed"" to shut part of the plant. Blaine van Rensburg, managing director of Banham Poultry said the ""safety of our employees remains our number one priority"". ""We continue to ensure that PPE is used appropriately by all employees and have teams in place to encourage and monitor social distancing measures,"" he added. A deep clean of the cutting room, where poultry is cut and packaged, will now take place. Only staff working in one area of the factory were tested while the wider plant, which employs about 1,100 people, remains open for production. Dr Smith said her department had sought specialist advice from Defra and the Food Standards Agency, as well as bio-security departments. She said they were exploring whether to talk to other poultry factories in the area. The east of England processes 7% of the country's poultry. Factories across the UK have been working to minimise risks against coronavirus, but despite this hundreds of workers have been infected. The Greencore sandwich factory in Northampton, where nearly 300 workers tested positive last week, has now reopened on a staggered start-up.

New home for artist Jonah Jones' Coleg Harlech sculpture,"Jonah Jones' Y Bont (The Bridge) has covered 29.2 metres on three sides of a lift shaft at Coleg Harlech for 40 years. The piece will now be included as part of a hotel redevelopment in the town. The artists' family and supporters said they are delighted it will continue to be seen by the public. Jones, who was also a writer, died in 2004. He made the work from more than 800 pieces of Sicilian marble and Welsh slate. It has been seen by countless students in the Coleg Harlech Workers' Educational Association accommodation block over the years. It was inspired by the mythical story of Branwen and Bendigeidfran from the Mabinogi - which has links to Harlech - and was put together especially for the college between 1969 and 1970. Scene and Word Ltd, a private company with charitable aims, which was set up by the artist's family and supporters to safeguard and preserve his work, supports the move. ""The work covers three sides of the lift shaft in the college canteen, and as the building is about to be demolished it had to be moved,"" said Pedr Jones the artist's son. ""It has now been agreed that it will be transferred to the St David's hotel redevelopment in the town and we're very happy with this as it will be seen in the reception area. ""It's a fantastic opportunity too for the development to feature this work, which was my father's largest piece, free of charge."" Jones, born into a mining family with Welsh roots in Tyne and Wear, started a workshop in Gwynedd after World War II and worked in stone, slate, marble, bronze, as well as stained glass. He was a friend of Clough Williams-Ellis and worked on his vision at Portmeirion village. In 1981, he created a plaque in tribute to Dylan Thomas for Westminster Abbey. Trefor Fon Owen, the principal of Coleg Harlech, said he was happy that a home was being found for the ""huge"" piece. ""It is so big, 30ft high by about 100ft across, so we have worked hard to get to a stage where it will have a new home that everyone is happy with,"" he said. ""The developers, Aitchinsons, will pay for it to be professionally dismantled, and then we will keep it for up to three years for them,"" he added. The work will be taken down by experts from the Architectural Glass Centre at Swansea Metropolitan University, before being stored ready for reinstallation in the new hotel.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
D-Day veteran Gordon Prime lands Legion d'Honneur in France,"Gordon Prime, 90, from Jameston near Tenby in Pembrokeshire, received the Legion d'Honneur medal for his heroism as a motorcycle dispatch rider. He began at Pegasus Bridge at the heart of the Normandy landings and was still serving when Nazi Germany was defeated. Days before the war's end, Mr Prime and a pal tossed a coin to take different routes and his friend was killed. He was one of 22 veterans to receive the honour at the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Then aged 20, he landed on Juno beach on D-Day at Courseulles driving a truck loaded with petrol and ammunition with his motorcycle in the back. He said: ""There were a lot of vehicles on fire and smashed up. And there were a few dead bodies about. ""But the thing was to get off the beach as quick as you can."" He was with 89 Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) attached to the Canadian Army and his mission was to supply units with rations, petrol, diesel and anything else they needed. From the following day, Mr Prime risked his life daily riding his Matchless 350cc motorcycle under fire to and from the front line to deliver ammunition, food and fuel. He said: ""You didn't know where you were sometimes. A lot of dispatch drivers drove in to German lines and were taken prisoner. ""It makes you wonder how we did it. You had a compass and map and you had to know where you were going. ""Our company motto was ""bash on regardless"" and that's just what we had to do. You couldn't give up - it would have been letting your mates down."" He survived the war from the liberation of France and Belgium, through the disastrous Operation Market Garden in Holland and eventually the fall of Germany. Perhaps his closest brush with death came just days before the war in Europe ended. He said: ""My number one pal was Bert Tinscombe. We trained together as motorcycle despatch riders and we went through into France together. ""We worked side by side and shared everything. ""Ten days from the end of the war, we tossed a coin to see which one of us would take a certain route, and he got blown up."" Mr Prime was due to fight in Japan in 1945 when the Americans dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war ended. He was presented with his medal during his 70th anniversary trip. He said: ""It was pretty emotional. I couldn't get over the amount of people wanting to shake my hand and say ""merci beaucoup"". Mr Prime founded the Birmingham and Pembrokeshire branches of the Normandy Veterans Association. He said: ""I sometimes feel guilty. They didn't make it and I did. I always think about the lads we left behind in Normandy.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Apple 'optimistic' about post-Brexit UK,"Apple's chief executive Tim Cook met Theresa May at Downing Street and said he thought the UK would be ""just fine""' outside the European Union. The company plans to build a new UK headquarters in London. His comments came as the US Chamber of Commerce said US firms had been delaying UK investment decisions. It has thousands of members in the US, including many large multinationals. Its head of international affairs, Myron Brilliant, told the BBC firms were worried about future trade rules. He said they thought there could be new regulatory challenges once the UK was no longer in the EU. 'Bumps in road' However, at his meeting with the prime minister, Mr Cook said:""We're a big believer in the UK - we think you'll be just fine. ""Yes there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK's going to be fine."" In a statement following the meeting, Apple said: ""We are proud that Apple's innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK. "" Apple's new UK headquarters will be in the redeveloped Battersea Power Station. Last year the company said it would move 1,600 staff there in 2021. Mr Cook described it as a huge headquarters and said the company was ""leaving significant space there to expand."" 'Vested stakeholders' Earlier the US Chamber of Commerce's Mr Brilliant told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money: ""They're [US firms] worried about what the transition rules are going to look like. ""They're worried about whether there are going to be new regulatory challenges, impediments, and so we're going to see how that plays out over the next two years. ""One also expects that the UK-EU will have a trade agreement. But what we're saying from Washington is that we're going to be vested stakeholders, as we have been in terms of our businesses here."" He added: ""Of course, some companies are holding back investment to see how this plays out. That makes sense. ""But there is no question that Europe is an important part of any company's international strategy. ""And so it's not that they're going to pull back from Europe, but they are going to realign their investments, depending on how these negotiations go.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Headline Numbers: Is UK inequality as bad as in the US?,"By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics, BBC News Research from the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, bonuses paid to Wall Street employees had been double the annual pay earned by all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage. So, 167,800 Wall Street employees were paid $28.5bn (£18.2bn) in bonuses, while 1,007,000 full-time minimum wage earners made about $14bn. One particularly eye-catching blog on the subject carried the headline: ""If You Own a Pitchfork, You Will Grab It When You See This Chart"". I wondered if this statistic was also true in the UK. The best proxy we have for the Wall Street bonus pool is the ONS figure for bonuses paid in the finance and insurance sector, the most recent figure for which was £14.4bn in the financial year 2013-14. The Low Pay Commission says that excluding apprenticeships there were 1.3 million jobs in 2014 that paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of which 40% were full-time, so that's about 520,000 jobs. Assuming everyone earned the highest level of minimum wage, the average level of the NMW for 2013-14 was £6.25. If we assume that they worked 37.5 hours a week (that's the average number of full-time hours given in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings for 2014) and that they work 48 weeks a year, their total earnings come to £5.9bn, which is less than half the amount paid in bonuses by the finance and insurance sector - it's about 40%. Before you go and buy a pitchfork, remember that there are differences between this figure and the US one. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. There were people paid very high bonuses but also people paid much more modest ones. The average overall was £13,300, but I would expect that to mask quite a range. But the other question is, what is this an indicator for and what would make it rise or fall? So, for example, imagine that 100,000 people earning minimum wage suddenly received a pay rise of £1 an hour. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. But it would be hard to argue that their pay rise had increased inequality. Nonetheless, if you were outraged by the figure from the US then you will be just as outraged that the same appears to be true in the UK.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London Fire Brigade spends £202k per year saving animals,"By Hannah GelbartBBC London London fire crews were called to rescue 542 animals - including dogs, foxes and snakes - between July 2015 and June 2016, figures from the service show. About half of the rescued animals were cats, but the brigade also spent £978 rescuing two hamsters and £1,304 saving four squirrels. LFB said people should call the RSPCA first for animal rescues. For more stories about animal rescues and lucky escapes follow BBC England's Pinterest board here. According to the brigade, it costs £326 per hour to fund a fire engine and crews were called to an animal rescue every 16 hours on average in the past 12 months. Pet owners are not charged for animal rescues. One of the hamsters was stuck in a cavity wall in Mawneys, Havering, and the other was trapped below floorboards in a house in Merton, south west London. The squirrels were trapped in a bathroom in Streatham Wells in Lambeth, inside the wall of a flat in Bow West, inside a third-floor flat in Canning Town South and in the boiler unit of a flat in Swiss Cottage. On 5 August firefighters rescued Binky the cat, who gave birth behind a fireplace after falling down a chimney from the roof of a house in Wood Green, north London. Binky had four kittens, who were named Ron, Chris, Pete and Jim after the firemen who rescued them. Unusual animal rescues: •A ferret trapped in a lift shaft in Kingston •A snake loose in a flat in Holloway •A tortoise trapped in New Malden •A chicken stuck in a tree in Stockwell •A squirrel trapped in a gutter in Hornchurch LFB said animal rescues had decreased by 20% in the past five years, but added the figure was still too high. London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson, said: ""If there is a cat up a tree, or an animal stuck anywhere, the first port of call should always be the RSPCA. ""When firefighters are out rescuing animals, they're not available to attend real emergencies."" The service recently ran a campaign called ""I'm An Animal, Get Me Out of Here"" to encourage Londoners to call the RSPCA when they see an animal in difficulty. Chief Superintendent of the RSPCA, John Grant, said the service was ""always incredibly grateful for any help we receive from the fire service"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Taylor Swift to headline Glastonbury festival on Sunday,"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter She will make her Glastonbury debut in June - the festival's 50th anniversary - headlining the Pyramid Stage. Swift announced on Twitter that she was ""ecstatic"", while holding up a photo of the festival's in-house newspaper with the headline: ""Sunday Night Taylor Made For Glastonbury."" Festival organiser Emily Eavis simply responded: ""Taylor! Yes!"" Swift, who performed on this weekend's Strictly Come Dancing final, joins previously-announced Saturday night headliner Paul McCartney; and Motown star Diana Ross, who will play the Sunday afternoon ""legends slot"". She is the first female artist to top the bill since Adele in 2016. Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis said he was excited to welcome the singer to Worthy Farm next year. ""She's one of the biggest stars in the world and her songs are absolutely amazing,"" he said. ""We're so delighted."" Friday's headliner is still to be revealed but festival organiser Emily Eavis recently said it would be a male artist, playing the festival ""for their first time"". Many Glastonbury-watchers expect the slot to be taken by US rapper Kendrick Lamar. The festival sold out in just 34 minutes when tickets went on sale in October. A resale for unwanted and unpaid tickets will take place on April 16, 2020 for coach tickets and April 19 for general tickets. Swift topped the charts everywhere from the UK to China with her seventh album, Lover, earlier this year. It has since become the only album of 2019 to sell more than one million ""pure"" copies - ie CD, vinyl and downloads, not including streams - in the US. The star, who celebrated her 30th birthday on Friday with a Christmas-themed party, recently announced a new approach to touring for 2020. After 2018's ambitious, 53-date Reputation stadium tour, which played to 2.8m fans and took $345.7m (£259.3m) at the box office, she's taking her show to festivals around the world, in an effort to meet new and unfamiliar audiences. ""The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, and summer,"" she wrote on social media. ""I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic. I want to go to some places I haven't been and play festivals."" The star will play one further date in the UK next summer: At London's BST festival in Hyde Park.

Pope Francis: 'Christians and Muslims are brothers and sisters',"He was speaking to Muslims who had sought shelter in the capital Bangui after nearly three years of violence between Christians and Muslims. The mosque visit was seen as perhaps the most difficult part of his Africa tour, a BBC correspondent says Pope Francis then held the final Mass of his Africa trip in Bangui. He was speaking in Latin, which was then translated into the local Sango language. His message of reconciliation appeared to have an immediate impact, as a reporter from the AFP news agency spotted a group of Muslim rebels turn up at the Mass wearing t-shirts with the Pope's image on them. The Pope has now left the CAR at the end of his six-day visit to the continent. More than 100,000 Muslims fled the capital as a result of the fighting but 15,000 are left in an area called PK5, according to the campaign group Human Rights Watch. Imam Tidiani Moussa Naibi thanked the Pope for his visit and said it was ""a symbol which we all understand"", the AP news agency reports. There was tight security for the visit to the Koudoukou mosque and armed UN peacekeepers were stationed on its minarets watching the crowds who had come to greet the pontiff. On Sunday, the Pope called on fighting factions in the CAR to lay down their weapons. About half of CAR's population is Christian and 15% Muslim. Celebrating Mass in Bangui, he said they should instead arm themselves ""with justice, love, mercy and authentic peace"". Earlier, he said he hoped next month's election in the CAR would open a ""new chapter"" for the country. The trip to the CAR was the pontiff's first visit to a conflict zone and the final stop on his three-nation African tour that also took in Kenya and Uganda. Conflict has blighted the CAR for decades but it was only in 2013 that the fighting took on a religious form. President Francois Bozize was ousted in a coup in March 2013 and a group of mostly Muslim rebels from the north, the Seleka, marched on Bangui, briefly taking control of the country. Their rebellion tapped into a feeling northerners had of being excluded and unrepresented by the central government, correspondents say. They targeted churches and Christian communities, which triggered the creation of the anti-Balaka - meaning anti-violence - militias, and led to a downward spiral of tit-for-tat violence which continues. Towns and villages are divided, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced into camps divided along religious lines.

Michelle O'Neill 'working remotely' after negative Covid-19 test,"It is understood Michelle O'Neill has been self-isolating since she learned a relative was infected with coronavirus. The Sinn Féin vice-president said she ""will continue to self-isolate and carry out my ministerial duties remotely"". There have been 902 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health in the last 24 hours. As of Saturday, 134 Covid patients were being treated in hospital, with 19 in intensive care and 11 on ventilators. There were no further Covid-related deaths recorded in the past 24 hours, leaving the death total at 587. There have been 5,475 new cases of the virus reported in the last seven days, bringing the overall total number of cases confirmed in Northern Ireland to 19,092. In the Republic of Ireland, there have been 1,012 new cases and three deaths. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 41,714 and the number of deaths to 1,824. Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he was ""very worried about the numbers we are seeing"". The negative test for the deputy first minister comes as the Stormont Executive continues to grapple with high infection rates across Northern Ireland, with the Derry and Strabane Council districts one of the worst hit areas in the UK and Ireland. On Friday, Northern Ireland recorded the highest daily total for the number of positive Covid-19 tests since the Department of Health rolled out its current testing model with 1,080 positive cases. In a written statement to the assembly, the health minister said the current estimate of R, or rate of infection in Northern Ireland, is between 1.3 and 1.8. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Robin Swann said over the last week, there has been a 100% increase in cases reported with only a 15% increase in testing. ""There has been a progressive rise in Covid hospital patients, which are now around 33% of peak levels during wave one,"" he said. ""Cases are currently doubling every seven days and hospital admissions every nine days, both reduced from last week; if current trends remain unabated hospital inpatients will exceed those of wave one in only two to three weeks. ""The situation is grave and getting more so, on a daily if not hourly basis."" On Thursday, Ms O'Neill took part in an executive meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster. The meeting saw ministers sign off on proposals brought by Justice Minister Naomi Long, so people caught breaching coronavirus regulations will now face a minimum fine of £200. On Thursday night, Mrs Long told the BBC NI's The View programme that she believed that she had been infected with the virus earlier this year and felt unwell for some time.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UN body bars Sri Lanka diplomat Maj Gen Shavendra Silva,"Major General Shavendra Silva led a division of the country's army during its civil war, and is the subject of a US lawsuit accusing him of war crimes. He was chosen by Asian countries to sit on a UN committee about peacekeeping. Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war ended in May 2009 with the military's defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. Maj Gen Silva and Sri Lanka's UN mission appear to have made no public comment on the exclusion yet. He was appointed to the Special Advisory Group on Peacekeeping Operations in January 2012. However Louise Frechette, the Canadian diplomat leading the group, said Silva's participation was ""not appropriate or helpful"", and went on to say that ""he will not participate in its deliberations"". Lawsuit The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo said the Sri Lankan government had stated that raising concerns about the former commander was ""unethical"". Our correspondent adds that a UN diplomat had told the BBC that Maj Gen Silva did attend the group's first meeting, but no members spoke to him and no documents were given to him. Maj Gen Silva, who is Sri Lanka's deputy ambassador to the UN, describes himself as a ""real hero"" for his command of the 58 Division, central to the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. However, a private lawsuit accusing the former soldier of war crimes is in progress in the US, and a number of UN officials have raised concerns over his actions during the war. Last week the UN's human rights chief, Navi Pillay, said Maj Gen Silva was suspected of committing human rights violations. Meanwhile, last year, a rights panel commissioned by Ban Ki-Moon said it believed several Tiger leaders were shot dead while trying to surrender as they walked towards the 58 Division's territory. Maj Gen Silva and the government deny this. His exclusion from the group was praised by Philippe Bolopion, the United Nations director for Human Rights Watch, according to AFP. The agency quoted him as saying: ""By defeating Silva's attempt to pose as a respectable peacekeeping expert, Louise Frechette took a principled stand ... member states and the UN secretary general should publicly back her decision.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: New 'fast and accurate' antibody test developed,"Quotien said each serological screening machine has capacity for up to 3,000 tests a day and produces results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy. The blood-screening firm is now keen to hold talks with UK ministers amid interest from Europe for the machines. The Scottish government said it will explore ""all options"" as they become available. Quotient said the test can spot whether a person has developed antibodies to Covid-19. Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus. 'Outstanding performance' Chief executive Franz Walt was managing director of the Singapore-based Roche Laboratory which developed the first diagnostic test for Sars in 2003. He said: ""We are truly proud to have developed such a fast and accurate test. This is an outstanding performance by our teams in both Edinburgh and Switzerland. ""We now want to make sure that we can help as many people as possible as quickly as possible. We have strong roots in the UK and want to speak to ministers there so MosaiQ can be used in the amazing national effort to tackle coronavirus and relaunch the economy. ""We realise ministers and the NHS are incredibly busy but are keen to talk given the strong interest from across Europe in the product."" European regulatory approval Quotient said it has 12 screening machines available which can process up to 36,000 tests a day or 252,000 a week. A further 20 are expected to be ready by the end of the year. The firm's headquarters are in Eysins, Nyon, but its Scottish research division is based in Penicuik, Midlothian. It also has a corporate office in Edinburgh. While the UK government says it has laboratory capability to test for coronavirus immunity, it is currently being used for survey testing of existing blood samples and the capacity is not known. It is also attempting to develop home testing kits, rather than requiring analysis in laboratories, but so far these have proved unreliable. On Friday, Quotient received European regulatory approval for the MosaiQ serological screening machines. It claims they have 100% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity, meaning there is a low chance of a misread or ""false positive"". 'Rigorous evaluation' Ed Farrell, chief operating officer at the Edinburgh office, said: ""We're incredibly proud of all our work here in Scotland and Switzerland. ""We've got such a rich history here and we hope we can now make a difference at this challenging time."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Health Protection Scotland, with key partners, explore all options around new antibody tests as they become available on the market. ""The Scottish government is working closely with the UK government to ensure that everyone is able to access new antibody tests when they become available. ""It is essential that any new tests are reliable, and time is needed to undertake rigorous evaluation so that there is confidence that tests are accurate.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What does it take to be a police officer?,"So with so many potential jobs up for grabs, we wanted to find out what it takes to become a constable in 2019. Is the fitness test really hard? Do you need to pass lots of exams? Can you join straight from school? Jo Noakes, director at The College of Policing, explains some of the basic eligibility requirements. Who can apply? We are looking for people with a range of skills and experience and people from diverse backgrounds and communities. You are not limited to any particular age group, although you must be over 18, and we also welcome people looking for a career change. Qualities we are looking for are people motivated to serve the public, who have common sense and display empathy. Do I need a degree? No you don't need a degree. There are three different entry routes and you can join straight from school on an apprenticeship if you want to. You will need to pass some written tests and need a GCSE in English (or equivalent) though. Do I have to be fit? You must physically and mentally be able to undertake police duties and there is a fitness requirement, because officers must be able to move quickly while carrying heavy equipment. If you pass the assessment process, you will then have to take a physical fitness test. To pass, you will need to be reasonably fit and able to run short distances fairly quickly. Later you will also have to pass a medical examination. What is the interview like? There is an assessment centre all candidates have to go through. The interview will be trying to tease out why you are joining policing and will include role play. We are trying to understand how you make decisions and assess your values and communication skills. The role play can be interesting and is not usually set in a police environment. For example you might be asked to role play someone who is working in customer service in a shopping centre. It is all about seeing if you can recognise the issues and solve problems. How much can you earn? It varies regionally. Lancashire Police start at £23,500 and the London Metropolitan Police starting salary is nearer to £30,000. Chief Constables earn over £100,000 though. Most people joining the Police aren't motivated by money. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Meghan avoids 'controversial' topics for fear of putting family 'at risk',"Speaking at a virtual summit, Meghan said she instead chose to talk about ""fairly straight forward"" topics ""like exercising your right to vote"". But she said she would not feel proud as a mother if she had not tried to ""make this world better"" for her son. The duke and duchess recently urged US voters to ""reject hate speech"". The Duke of Sussex made the remarks in a television broadcast alongside his wife last month - their first joint TV appearance since they ceased being working members of the Royal Family earlier this year. The couple also urged US citizens to vote in the country's upcoming presidential election. A spokesperson for the Sussexes said the comments did not refer to any specific political party or candidate, but were instead ""a call for decency"". Appearing at Fortune's members-only Most Powerful Women Next Gen Summit on Tuesday, Meghan was asked whether motherhood had made her more courageous or more cautious. Speaking from her home in California, she replied: ""It's interesting because my gut is that it makes you more courageous. ""It makes you so concerned for the world they're going to inherit, and so the things that you're able to tolerate on your own are not the same. ""You go every single day: 'How can I make this better for him? How can I make this world better for Archie?' And that is a shared belief between my husband and I. ""At the same time, I am cautious of putting my family in a position of risk by certain things, and so I try to be rather very clear with what I say and to not make it controversial, but instead to talk about things that seem fairly straight forward - like exercising your right to vote."" She added: ""As a parent I can enjoy all the fun and silliness and games with my son, but I wouldn't be able to feel proud of myself as a mom if I didn't know that I wasn't doing my part to make it a better place for him."" Asked about her views on social media she compared it to an ""addiction"" for some, which could be ""unhealthy"", adding that she does not have any online accounts for her ""own self-preservation"". The duchess closed her personal Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts four months before she married the Duke of Sussex, while her lifestyle blog thetig.com shut down in 2017. Since stepping back as a working member of the Royal Family in March, Meghan has spoken out on issues including racism and the death of African-American George Floyd in the US. The couple gave up their roles as senior royals in a bid for personal and financial freedom. They now live in the US but are still members of the Royal Family.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Geraint Thomas gold in team pursuit: Congratulations for cyclist,"Thomas, 26, and his three team-mates stormed to victory over Australia in the men's pursuit in the Velodrome in a world record time. Social media was overwhelmed with messages from cycling fans, politicians and fellow sportsmen and women. First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales could not be more proud. ""Huge congratulations to Geraint Thomas on winning Wales' first gold at London 2012,"" he said. ""What a breathtaking and record breaking performance by Geraint and his teammates. Wales couldn't be prouder!"" Sport Minister Huw Lewis said: ""Many, many congratulations to Geraint and his team mates on this wonderful performance. ""To win one Olympic gold medal is an incredible achievement, but for Geraint to win two in consecutive Games is the stuff of dreams and the product of many years of hard work and sacrifices."" On Twitter, there were hundreds of messages congratulating Thomas and the rest of the team: Thomas, who rode with the Maindy Flyers club in Cardiff until he was 16, is the first Welsh athlete to win gold at the London Games, while rower Chris Bartley won silver in the lightweight men's four at Eton Dorney on Thursday. He is also the first Welsh athlete to win gold medals in back-to-back Olympics since equestrian rider Richard Meade in 1968 and 1972. The GB team pursuit team of Thomas, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh also broke world records in the build up to Friday's final. Thomas went to Whitchurch High School in north Cardiff, the same school as Wales and Tottenham Hotspur footballer Gareth Bale and Wales rugby captain Sam Warburton. Maindy Flyers head coach Alan Davis said he was ""ecstatic"" at Thomas's win. He was travelling on a train to London to watch the cycling at the velodrome on Saturday so did not see the race, but insisted on receiving texts every 1km with the team's split times. Mr Davis said: ""It was totally awesome. He's a fantastic inspiration for the youngsters. He comes down a couple of times a year and signs autographs and has been on rides with a couple of the older ones."" He said the club was producing many fine young cyclists and Thomas had helped to inspire that success. ""He's shown all the others what can be achieved. Success breeds success. Someone like Geraint is the perfect role model,"" he said. ""He's humble and takes his success and occasional setbacks equally well. What better example to give nine-year-old kids.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Indonesia post-election protests leave six dead in Jakarta,"Indonesian police confirmed the death toll based on reports from hospitals. They said the cause of the deaths was being investigated. The national police chief has denied his officers used live ammunition. Police fired tear gas at protesters when clashes broke out again in the capital on Wednesday. Protesters hurled fireworks and rocks at police during a stand-off near the election supervisory agency, while clashes also restarted in other areas of the city. Social media has been restricted in some areas to stop rumours spreading. The protests erupted after official election results showed Mr Widodo had beaten his long-time rival Prabowo Subianto at the polls last month. How have the authorities responded? National police chief Tito Karnavian said some of the six dead appeared to have gunshot wounds and others ""blunt force wounds"". The authorities have said the protests were planned and ""not spontaneous"". They have suggested that a group of provocateurs may have been responsible for the violence. ""A majority of the protesters came from outside of Jakarta,"" said Muhammed Iqbal, a police spokesman. President Widodo has promised firm action against rioters. ""I open myself to anyone to work together to build and develop this nation, but I won't tolerate anyone who tries to disrupt public security, the democratic process or the unity of our... country,"" the president said at a press briefing. How did the protests start? Protests in the capital Jakarta began peacefully on Tuesday but soon turned violent, with cars set on fire and firecrackers thrown at police. Police in riot gear fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The country's General Election Commission confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Widodo had won the presidency, taking 55.5% of votes. Mr Prabowo rejected the results, alleging cheating, but the election commission dismissed his claims. The ex-general also lost against Mr Widodo at the last election in 2014, and went on to unsuccessfully challenge the results. More than 192 million people were eligible to vote in the presidential and general elections that took place on 17 April. After the official results were announced on Tuesday, thousands gathered in front of the election supervisory building in support of Mr Prabowo, but later moved on to other areas across Jakarta after police urged the crowd to disperse, according to BBC Indonesian. Local TV stations showed several standoffs between protesters and police in parts of the city. More than 30,000 troops had been deployed in Jakarta in anticipation of potential violence. Mr Prabowo repeated calls for supporters to protest peacefully. ""We support people's constitutional rights [to protest] as long as they are civilised, peaceful and non-violent,"" he told reporters. On Wednesday, chief security minister Wiranto, who uses just a single name, said access to social media would be blocked in some areas. The restrictions - including on photo and video sharing - aimed to control the spread of misinformation, he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Extinction Rebellion: Central London targeted despite ban,"Activists blocked Oxford Circus with a wooden pyramid structure and descended on Westminster before moving to Trafalgar Square. One man, who was dressed up as Boris Johnson, scaled the scaffolding surrounding Big Ben. More than 1,760 arrests have been made in connection with the London protests. A ""closing ceremony"" to mark the end of nearly two weeks of protests was held in Trafalgar Square. Protesters moved there from Westminster, where an activist was arrested after climbing the scaffolding around the Elizabeth Tower. He unfurled an Extinction Rebellion banner to ""highlight government inaction on the climate and ecological emergency"". The man, named by the group as tree surgeon Ben Atkinson, 43, was on the scaffolding for nearly three hours, before police brought him down safely using a lift at about 19:00 BST. Mr Atkinson had been willing to stay up there until his demand to speak to the prime minister was met, according to a fellow activist. Outside the gates of Downing Street, protesters sang and held up their hands - which many had painted red to symbolise blood. ""We will raise our red hands, taking responsibility for our actions - we all have blood on our hands,"" a post on Extinction Rebellion's website reads. Alan Partridge actor Steve Coogan joined the protest. Earlier police used a cherry picker to clear protesters perched on a wooden structure built to block the road at Oxford Circus. Specialist teams brought in a JCB to dismantle the structure that protesters had made. The Extinction Rebellion London Twitter account said the junction, which was also occupied by the group for several days in April, was targeted because Oxford Street is a centre of fast fashion and is heavily polluted. It also said the central London street was a ""hub of luxury goods for the wealthiest"", citing an Oxfam report from 2015 that claimed the richest 10% of people are responsible for half of all carbon emissions. The protests come despite a ban on two or more people linked to Extinction Rebellion assembling in London, announced by police on Monday. The Met Police lifted the ban following the ""closing ceremony"" at Trafalgar Square, explaining that it was no longer necessary because the stretch of protests, dubbed the Autumn Uprising, had ended. The demonstrations had originally been due to finish on Saturday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London 2012: Unauthorised Olympic branded goods seized,"By Nick ServiniBBC Wales business correspondent The action supports strict controls which only allow official sponsors to link themselves to the Games. Shops and traders near the Millennium Stadium - which is hosting Olympic football - have also been warned. Lawyer Lee Fisher claimed the ruling was causing problems for small firms who wanted to celebrate the event. Brand protection The T-shirts being seized feature phrases such as ""Olympic drinking team"" and the mugs are printed with the words: ""If coffee drinking was an Olympic sport I'd be a gold medallist."" The seizure offers a glimpse into the world of brand protection, and brands do not get much bigger than the Olympics. The use of the word Olympic, as well as the use of the rings, are banned for trading purposes at all times under specific criminal legislation. There are also temporary guidelines in place within the vicinity of the Olympic venues. In the case of Cardiff it covers around half of the city centre while the football matches are played. The use of certain combinations of words such as London and games or 2012 and games are banned for trading purposes. Ambush marketing There are also guidelines governing street trading and advertising. Handley Brustad, a trading standards officer with Cardiff council, is helping to enforce them on behalf of the Olympic organisers. He said the big challenge will be trying to prevent ambush marketing, where companies try to piggyback onto the Olympics by handing out flyers and items like branded hats. He said: ""The eyes of the world are going to be on Cardiff. We are going to show it in the best light possible. ""Whatever they come up with I'm sure we will deal with it."" Lee Fisher, an intellectual property lawyer with Morgan Cole solicitors in Cardiff, said the aim of the regulations is to protect the income generated from official Olympic sponsors. However, he said: ""It is one of the most restrictive regimes to have been put around any event, but particularly the Olympics, in terms of the clear ban around areas where the Olympics are taking place. ""I can see the justification for it but it is causing problems for small business who are not necessarily trying to make money but trying to enter into the spirit of things."" Some traders in Cardiff claim there has been confusion but trading standards officials say there has been extensive consultation and that the intention with the enforcement is not to get in the way of any local trading.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Coronavirus: New mortgage holiday should affect credit record, says Nationwide boss","By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Lenders look at somebody's credit rating when deciding whether to agree to a fresh loan or contract and the interest rate they will charge. Joe Garner, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, said an extension to the mortgage break may signal a borrower was ""struggling"". He made the comment as the UK's largest mutual announced a plunge in profits. Its statutory pre-tax profit fell to £466m in the year to April, compared with £833m the previous year. The building society said it had already faced pressure on its profits before it took a £101m hit as a direct result of coronavirus. Mortgage holidays started in March, allowing people to defer payments without affecting their credit rating. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June, but the Treasury and regulators have said that those who need to will be permitted to defer for another three months. No decision has yet been made on whether this will be reflected on a credit reference used by other lenders. Mr Garner said that 280,000 of its members had taken a payment break, the vast majority of which were mortgage holders. ""Probably the very first people to apply would be those who are really on top of their financial position and we know there are a lot of people who have taken them as a precaution, and will go back to paying in full at the first opportunity,"" he said. For those who needed a further payment break - which could include people who have continued to be furloughed, on sick pay, or who are self-employed - Mr Garner suggested there should be some kind of temporary notice on their credit rating until mortgage payments returned to normal. This should not be a ""big black mark"", he said, but ""a middle way"" that would alert lenders with a temporary mark, but not restrict people's ability to remortgage. ""If someone is struggling, and if there is no sign on their credit rating, they could go out and take further and further loans, which would not be in their interest,"" he told the BBC. The rules over whether credit ratings would be immune from further mortgage holidays have yet to be finalised by regulators. Credit ratings are used widely to inform lenders' decisions on financial products - from granting personal loans to allowing access to mobile phone contracts. Credit card breaks The UK banking sector has approved 1.8 million mortgage holidays during the crisis, according to figures from trade body UK Finance. There have also been 877,800 freezes on credit cards, up 26% since the start of the month, and 608,000 payment holidays on personal loans, up 30% over the same period. However, in some circumstances, the build-up of interest could risk taking people over a limit which itself would leave a mark on their credit reference. Millions of people have seen the first £500 of an arranged overdraft made interest-free for three months.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Miss Iraq and Miss Israel reunited after selfie controversy,"Sarah Idan was representing Iraq at the 2017 pageant in Las Vegas when she snapped a picture with Miss Israel, Adar Gandelsman, and posted it online. In the caption, she wrote ""Peace and Love from Miss Iraq and Miss Israel"". But some people in Iraq did not see it that way and, she said, sent her death threats. Iraq and Israel have no diplomatic relations, and Ms Idan's message was interpreted by some as an endorsement of Israel and a betrayal of Palestinian Arabs. ""When I posted the picture I didn't think for a second there would be blowback,"" she told CNN at the time. ""I woke up to calls from my family and the Miss Iraq Organization going insane. The death threats I got online were so scary."" Ms Idan and her family relocated to the US, but on Monday she was reunited with Ms Gandelsman in Israel, where the two posted fresh pictures online. Ms Idan posted a photograph and a video on her Instagram page, with the caption ""Sisters reunion"". Ms Idan, who eventually didn't place in the Miss Universe contest, toured part of Jerusalem and ate at an Iraqi-Jewish restaurant in the Mahane Yehuda shuk. ""I don't think Iraq and Israel are enemies, I think maybe the governments are enemies with each other,"" she said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 News. ""But there's a lot of Iraqi people that don't have a problem with Israelis."" Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he welcomed her visit. ""Friendly relations between Israelis & Arabs will definitely help in ushering in a better tomorrow for all of us in the Middle East,"" he wrote on Twitter. Back in November, Ms Idan refused to take down her original selfie, despite what she said was pressure from the Miss Iraq organisation, but she did add a follow up post saying she had not intended to cause offence. ""I would like to apologise to anyone who considered the photo to be offensive to the Palestinian cause as this was not the aim behind the post, it was merely a call to peace and hope for a solution to the crisis,"" she wrote.

"Committee roles for Davies, Davies, Davies (and Davies)","David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales It appears that the Commons select committee on Welsh affairs will initially be established with just six members, all men. It usually has 11, the maximum allowed. Only two of the 28 Labour MPs from Wales - Geraint Davies and Paul Flynn - have put their names forward. Among the Conservatives, Monmouth MP David T.C. Davies has been elected chair but he has only two colleagues from his own party - Chris Davies and Glyn Davies. Glyn Davies is also parliamentary private secretary to Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and, although he may be among the more independent-minded MPs, it is very unusual for a junior member of the government to sit on the committee set up to scrutinise his boss's department. 'Crucial' Plaid Cymru have focused their attention on the lack of Labour members, accusing its MPs of neglecting their duty to hold the government to account. Ceredigion MP Ben Lake who does want to sit on the committee said: ""The Welsh affairs committee produces crucial work and was influential in the previous Parliament on matters such as railways, the steel industry and agriculture. It's important that MPs take this work seriously. ""Labour's empty promises of 'standing up for Wales' and to 'stop the Tories trampling all over Wales' are frankly laughable when we see the reality of how little they do in Westminster."" Over to a Welsh Labour spokesperson: ""This absurd attack from Plaid Cymru is their usual mix of inaccuracy, wilful misrepresentation and sheer desperation. More than half of Welsh Labour's MPs have shadow frontbench roles, which precludes a majority of Welsh MPs from sitting on committees. ""But this means that Welsh Labour MPs are better represented than ever in the shadow cabinet and across the shadow front bench, and enables them to stand up for Wales and hold the Tories to account day in, day out. From Brexit to Equalities, Justice to Culture, Defence to Home Affairs, Welsh Labour MPs are leading the fight against this appalling Tory government and standing up for Wales."" 'Ambiguous' The committee does have an ambiguous role in the age of devolution. In the old days, it scrutinised the Welsh Office, which had responsibilities in areas for such as education and health. Today's Wales Office has few executive powers but under David T.C. Davies the committee has broadened its remit to look at issues that matter in Wales, such as the steel industry and Severn Bridge tolls. But compared to the relative glamour of committees scrutinising Brexit, business or the Treasury it appears to have relatively little appeal for MPs. It would not be surprising if more MPs were added to the membership, but another Commons motion would have to be agreed before that happens.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russell Bishop trial: Jurors hear how bodies were found,"Kevin Rowland was 18 when he helped search for Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway near Brighton. Russell Bishop, 52, formerly of Brighton, is on trial for a second time and denies two counts of murder. Mr Rowland said he saw a jumper and then a girl's face but stopped because he ""did not want to go any further"". Asked what his first words were, he said: ""I think we've found them."" He said he sat down and sent his friend Matthew Marchant, then 18, to find police, and Mr Marchant returned with Mr Bishop and his dog. He said the defendant sat next to him and did not get any closer to the girls, despite trying to, adding: ""He tried to step over me but I put my arm out to stop him."" Jurors heard they were joined by PC Paul Smith and the officer checked the girls, who were both nine years old. ""He had to crawl through the undergrowth. He traversed to the right to where the girls were,"" he said. The court also heard claims that Mr Bishop had felt the bodies for a pulse, but Mr Rowland denied it and said: ""Absolutely not."" Earlier, former local resident Janet Reid gave evidence for the prosecution about the last sightings of the girls. She had given evidence for the defence in 1987 anonymously, as Mrs White. Jurors heard Mrs Reid originally told police she saw the girls standing opposite her home on 9 October and recalled Nicola had waved at her at about 18:25. But jurors heard she now said it was about 20:20 - two hours later. The court heard her estimate of the first timing was because TV soap opera Crossroads was starting when she went indoors, but she said she had since realised they had watched a film called Runaway Train. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC asked her if all the timings had to go back two hours, to which she replied: ""Don't know."" Defending, Joel Bennathan QC referred to her being allowed to give the name of Mrs White in the first trial. He said there had been threats and incidents including damage to her husband's motorbike, to which Mrs Reid added: ""We had boulders through the window."" Mrs Reid confirmed Nicola had twice told her daughter the father she lived with was ""not her real dad"" and one day she would run away to find her real father.

Mars probe returns first pictures,"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) arrived on 19 October, putting itself in a highly elliptical parking orbit. This must be circularised over the coming year before the mission can begin full science operations. But scientists have taken the opportunity of some close passes to the planet in recent days to check out the TGO's instrumentation. There is delight at the quality of the pictures returned from camera system, CaSSIS (the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System). TGO passed over a region called Hebes Chasma at its closest approach, just 250km from the Martian terrain. ""We saw Hebes Chasma at 2.8 metres per pixel,"" said Nicolas Thomas, the camera's principal investigator from the University of Bern, Switzerland. ""That's a bit like flying over Bern at 15,000km/h and simultaneously getting sharp pictures of cars in Zurich."" TGO sensors NOMAD and ACS also came through their early tests successfully. These are the sensors that will make a detailed inventory of Mars' atmospheric gases. In particular, they will go after the components that constitute less than 1% of the planet's air - chemical species such as methane, water vapour, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. Methane is the main focus. From previous measurements, its concentration is seen to be low and sporadic in nature. But the mere fact that it is detected at all is really fascinating. The simple organic molecule should be destroyed easily in the harsh Martian environment, so its persistence - and the occasional spikes in its signal - indicate a replenishing source of the gas. The speculation is that it could be coming from microbial life somewhere on the planet. It will be CaSSIS's job to look for possible geological forms on the surface that might tie into methane sources. A fourth instrument, FREND (successfully tested in recent days, too), will sense hydrogen in the near-surface. This data can be used as a proxy for the presence of water or hydrated minerals. This again is information that could yield answers to the methane question. TGO was the unspoken success on the day Esa's Schiaparelli lander crashed into Mars. The surface probe had been dropped off at the Red Planet by TGO and was making its ill-fated descent just as the satellite took up its parking orbit. The successful insertion almost went unnoticed in the fuss over Schiaparelli. TGO is the first phase in a joint venture at Mars that Europe is undertaking with Russia. The second step in this project known as ExoMars is to put a robot rover on the planet in 2021. It needs a large injection of cash on the European side to go forward, however - just over €400m. Research ministers from Esa member states are meeting this week in Lucerne, Switzerland, to try to resolve this budget problem. Seeing TGO perform so well should at the very least give the politicians a warm feeling as they push through their difficult discussions.

Luke Durbin disappearance: Police search Suffolk woods,"They are combing the area around Foxhall Stadium in Ipswich in the hunt for Luke Durbin, 19, of Hollesley, near Woodbridge, who was last seen in 2006. Police believe a possible sighting of Mr Durbin near the stadium is now more significant than they first thought. A man at the stadium reported seeing a young man matching his appearance on Friday, 12 May, 2006. The eyewitness saw the man resembling Mr Durbin walking towards the nearby water tower between 07:30 and 08:00 BST. Search dogs Mr Durbin was reported missing by his mother Nicki the following day. Specialist police officers supervised a search on Sunday by members of the Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue and the National Search and Rescue Dog Association. Detectives have reviewed CCTV footage from Ipswich town centre and saw Mr Durbin near the Old Cattlemarket bus station at 04:00 BST on 12 May. The inquiry team also received information about a sighting of Mr Durbin between 11:00 and 14:00 BST on Saturday, 13 May, 2006 in Woodbridge. He was in a dark blue Renault Megane seen near the Turban Centre. In November 2010 detectives from the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team took on the case and reviewed the evidence and inquiries so far, leading to the new search. 'Unlawfully killed' Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp John Brocklebank said the stadium sighting could now prove to be useful and may reveal an extended route Mr Durbin took. ""If this man is right, then we have a further confirmed sighting of Luke later on that Friday morning and it then opens up several lines of inquiry,"" he said. ""By carrying out a detailed search of the area, we can see if there are any items of clothing or other material, which may suggest Luke was in the area as this man suggests. ""Although this still remains a missing person inquiry, we are looking at all possibilities of what has happened to Luke, which includes Luke being unlawfully killed."" Anyone with any information about Mr Durbin's disappearance is asked to contact the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team or Crimestoppers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Iraqi detainees beaten, inquiry told","The Al-Sweady Inquiry is examining claims following the Battle of Danny Boy in Maysan province, southern Iraq. Patrick O'Connor QC said the abuse included detainees being kicked in the head while they were helpless, beatings and strip searches. The Ministry of Defence claims there was no mistreatment. In his opening statement, Mr O'Connor claimed the detainees also suffered abuse once in their cells, sleep deprivation, mock executions and violence while being escorted to and from interrogations. The barrister, who is representing nine Iraqi survivors and bereaved relatives of people who died on the battlefield, said: ""These are not matters of individual spontaneous misconduct. They are planned, calculated and trained abuses by branches of the state."" Tactical questioning It is alleged Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji (CAN) on 14 and 15 May 2004. It is also alleged that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated at the camp and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base between 14 May and 23 September 2004. Mr O'Connor said that all nine detainees had said they had been ""kicked in the head when they were defenceless"" and complained of being beaten when being transported to CAN with ""blows to enforce silence"". The shock of capture was maintained through rough handling, it was claimed, and strip searches were carried out which would have had a ""strong psychological impact on the Iraqis"". They also suffered medical neglect at CAN and oppressive or tactical questioning, it was claimed. The inquiry heard various witnesses described hearing shouting, the banging of a metal pole, sobbing, crying and the sound of tables being overturned and chairs being thrown. The banging of the metal pole was a ""shock tactic and would play on the detainee's mind,"" it was suggested, while there was sleep deprivation and water squeezed into their mouths so they choked and could not drink, it was alleged. Mock executions were used as a part of a ""calculated and sinister regime to break down these detainees"", Mr O'Connor claimed. The Ministry of Defence has vigorously denied all the allegations, saying any deaths happened on the battlefield. Document trawl The inquiry, named after one of the dead men, 19-year-old Hamid al-Sweady, is the second public inquiry into allegations of abuse by British troops in Iraq, following one that examined the death in 2003 of Baha Mousa. Three years have passed between the setting up of this inquiry and its opening as staff, including retired detectives, have trawled through as many as 12,000 documents. It has already cost £15m, and that figure is expected to double, with as many as 200 military witnesses likely to be called and 45 Iraqis expected to give evidence by video-link from Beirut, including medical staff and ambulance drivers. Fifteen Iraqi witnesses are due to give evidence in person, among them the nine detainees and family members of the dead. The inquiry is being chaired by retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes and is set to last a year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Managers are heavier drinkers than manual workers,"The annual Lifestyle Survey, published by the Office for National Statistics reflects the habits of UK adults in 2009. Average weekly alcohol consumption for managers was 13.5 units, compared with 10.7 units in those in manual jobs. The survey also showed that the number of alcohol-related deaths has fallen slightly. The current recommendations for daily alcohol intake are that it should not regularly exceed three to four units for men and two to three units for women. However, the survey reveals that amongst managers, 41% of men and 35% of women exceeded these recommendations, on at least one day in the week before they took part in the survey. When people were asked about heavy drinking - defined as more than eight units for men and more than six for women - 23% of men and 15% of women in managerial households had reached those levels of drinking on at least one day in the week before the survey. Amongst manual workers, the figures were 19% of men and 11% of women. Chris Sorek, Chief Executive of the charity Drinkaware said heavy drinking among professionals was a cultural problem: ""While there continues to be a strong culture of drinking as part of professional roles it's not surprising to see managers drinking more than manual workers. Meetings and get-togethers are all situations where professionals may feel under pressure to drink. We also know many de-stress with a drink at home after a long working day."" Economic effect The number of alcohol-related deaths in the UK has increased since the early 1990s, rising from 4,023 in 1992 to the 9,031 in 2008. However in 2009 the number of deaths fell slightly to 8,664. Overall though, the number of deaths is still up 26% on a decade ago The drop in alcohol-related deaths was welcomed by the charity Drinkaware. However, its chief executive, Chris Sorek said it was important not be complacent: ""It's really encouraging to see a drop in alcohol-related deaths but the fact that thousands of people are still dying from alcohol misuse shows we must not rest on our laurels."" Don Shenker, of Alcohol Concern said that the economic situation was part of the explanation. ""The slight fall in 2009 in alcohol related deaths mirrors a slight drop in alcohol consumption, and while this is positive, is wholly due to a drop in consumer spending as a result of the recession. ""It is very likely that alcohol consumption will rise again once the economy picks up."" Smoking, was found to be almost twice as common in manual households with 29% of adults smoking cigarettes, compared with 15% of adults in managerial and professional households.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Alton Towers Smiler crash: Park closed for weekend,"Two carriages on the Smiler rollercoaster crashed on Tuesday, seriously injuring four of those on board. One victim, Vicky Balch, whose 20th birthday is today, is undergoing surgery for ""significant"" leg injuries. Her condition is not life-threatening, her solicitor said in a statement. Ms Balch's lawyer, Paul Paxton, said his office hoped to hold discussions with park owner Merlin Entertainment's insurers and their legal team next week. ""This is certainly not how she intended to celebrate her 20th birthday today,"" he added. ""The family remain grateful for the stream of good wishes."" Meanwhile, the theme park has said it is ""working towards"" reopening in the next few days. A spokesman said the park would only reopen after the firm ""completed a thorough appraisal of all our safety processes which is ongoing"". The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which is investigating what happened, expect to be on-site all weekend, the BBC understands. Inspectors have already served a prohibition notice on the ride, stopping its use ""until action is taken to deal with the cause of the failure"". Ms Balch, from Leyland in Lancashire, was one of four people hospitalised after the crash. Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton, underwent surgery on Thursday, the BBC understands. Joe Pugh, 18, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and his girlfriend, Leah Washington, 17, are understood to have been taken to University Hospital Coventry. The crash also prompted Merlin Entertainments to close rollercoasters at two of its other parks for safety checks. Thorpe Park's flagship Saw rollercoaster, and two rides at Chessington World of Adventures will remain out of action until new protocols have been applied, the firm said. Paul Burton, from enthusiast group the European Coaster Club, told BBC News he was shocked by the crash, as large rides such as the Smiler are subject to ""lots of safety checks and safety mechanisms"". ""I've never seen anything like it before,"" he said. Mr Burton, who rode the Smiler three days before the incident, said there was a one in 24 million risk of ""being caught up in this kind of situation"". ""This kind of accident is completely unheard of. ""We cannot speculate, but from [the investigation] there will be a diagnosis and from that people can understand what happened.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Retail: Chain shop closures outweigh new stores opening,"There was a net loss of 37 chain shops in the 11 towns surveyed, suggesting Wales was proportionally the worst-affected part of the UK. Pubs, bookmakers, and men's clothes shops saw the highest fall in Wales. However, there was some growth in opticians, chocolatiers, sports good shops and beauty salons. Researchers studied town centres deemed to be in Great Britain's top 500 high streets, including Abergavenny, Barry, Newport, Swansea, Cardiff, Carmarthen, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pontypridd, Bridgend and Cwmbran. The analysis by Local Data Company and PwC showed the shortfall between chains opening and closing was at the highest level since the analysis began in 2014. Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan was the only town surveyed in Wales not to see a net decline. The town's centre saw one chain shop closing and one opening in the first half of this year. Fifty-five per cent of its shops are independent, meaning the chain retailers make up a significant proportion of the occupants. Rachael Williams, who is involved with the Holton Road Traders' Association, said the departure of chains such as Dorothy Perkins, Burton and New Look had affected footfall and created a negative perception of the area. ""You've either got to make the units bigger to attract the bigger shops, or you've got to make the rates lower to attract the independents,"" she added. Her husband Ceri Williams, who co-owns Marshalls Butchers on the main street Holton Road, said a reduction in chain shops was ""another nail in the coffin"" for the high street. In July, locals Stuart Burnell and his fiancée opened the Awesome Wales zero waste refill shop, next to Marshalls, and said they had been well-supported by residents. ""It's vitally important we have different types of shop that will bring people back into the town centre,"" he said. His neighbour Mr Williams added: ""Getting people in the town is the biggest challenge because it's so hard to draw people in, but the [refill] shop next door, he has brought a lot of people in, and nice people who care about the environment and we're getting a bit of spin off from that."" The analysis looked at the top 500 high streets with the largest number of chain stores, which is why there were no towns in north Wales on the list. Ben Cottam, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales, described the analysis as ""sobering"". ""We now see that some of the pressures of consumer behaviour, business rates burdens and other issues are hitting even the biggest names,"" he added. FSB Wales called on the Welsh Government to allocate some of the £600m announced for Wales in the chancellor's recent spending review towards a future of Welsh towns fund to develop new thinking on boosting regional towns. The Welsh Government said the money did ""not make up for nearly a decade of cuts"" and it was considering how best to use the money and would bring forward a budget for 2020-21 ""as early as possible"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sir Quentin Thomas retires from BBFC after 10 years,"Sir Quentin, who has held the position for 10 years, described his time in charge as a ""great privilege"". ""When I was appointed, Ali G said it was the best job in the world as you got to watch porn all day. ""He was wrong about the porn but right that it is a great job."" Sir Quentin will stay until a successor is chosen. He added the position had provided him with ""ample opportunity to sample the range, depth and diversity of film."" Prior to becoming BBFC president, Sir Quentin held posts at the Home Office, the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office. Controversial decisions He also worked on the law on obscenity and film censorship and advised the government on broadcast policy during his time at the Home Office. ""It has been a great privilege and pleasure to serve as President,"" said Sir Quentin in a statement. ""The Board has a great team under the effective leadership of its Director David Cooke. There is an enthusiastic staff with an unrivalled knowledge of film and of the regulatory issues."" During the last 10 years, Sir Quentin has presided over a number of controversial classifications. The board defended its decision, in 2008, to award The Dark Knight a 12A certificate after getting more than 80 complaints about the Batman film's disturbing content. In 2010, the board received 24 objections over its decision to give Peter Jackson's film The Lovely Bones a 12A rating - more complaints about than any other movie that year. The BBFC celebrated its 100th year last month, with a book charting 100 years of classification scheduled for the autumn. ""I hope and believe the public and the industry appreciate the work the Board has done now for some 100 years,"" added Sir Quentin. ""It is important we retain their confidence as film continues to explore the full range of human experience, inevitably pushing at the boundaries as it does so."" Director of the BBFC, David Cooke, said the outgoing president's tenure had brought greater public interest and respect from within the industry. ""I am very sorry that we have been unable to persuade Sir Quentin to stay on."" he said. ""He has overseen improved efficiency and speed of decisions, innovative new services for video-on-demand, and the provision of rich and helpful content information to the public.""

RBS defends business lending practices,"A damning report by a government adviser this week shook the bank saying it took advantage of ailing companies, seizing assets at a knockdown price. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton told the BBC he wants the firm of City lawyers, Clifford Chance, to get to the bottom of the allegations. Any evidence of wrongdoing will go to the Serious Fraud Office. Sir Philip said in a BBC interview it was difficult to strike the right balance all the time: ""We will, almost certainly, have been too heavy with some customers from time to time. And we will, almost certainly, have been too lax with customers from time to time, given that we have dealt with many, many thousands of business in distress in recent years. ""I am certain that we will have got it wrong in both directions because there are so many people that we have had to deal with in deep distress."" Profit Business Secretary Vince Cable has already referred the report to City regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, The report, by Lawrence Tomlinson, the ""Entrepreneur in residence at Mr Cable's department, claimed RBS put some ""good and viable"" businesses into default for profit. The allegations centre on RBS's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) lending division, which specialises in handling loans seen as being more risky. The Tomlinson report says that putting a business into the GRG generated revenue for the bank through fees, increased profit margins and the purchase of devalued assets by their property division, West Register. Independent The practice of removing a bad debt from a bank's books is not an unreasonable one, particularly as major lenders have been trying to move away from riskier assets. But Mr Tomlinson told the BBC that there was a perception among small businesses that they are being ""purposefully distressed"" in order to get them into the GRG which, even if wrong, should be addressed by RBS. Mr Tomlinson acted independently of government in producing the report, and did not set out to look solely at RBS, which is 81% owned by the government. But he said what he had uncovered through talking to businesses had put RBS and its GRG division into focus. Clifford Chance's review will report by 31 January and will look at specific allegations, as well as banking culture in general. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said earlier this week that the allegations were ""deeply troubling and extremely serious"" and ought to be pursued ""to the fullest extent of the law"". RBS said it would co-operate with the investigations.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
PC Semple murder: Witness heard 'someone throwing up on the carpet',"The man arrived at Stefano Brizzi's London flat for a sex party on the night of the alleged murder. Mr Brizzi denies murder but has admitted disposing of PC Semple's body. The witness said he arranged to go to the flat on 1 April but got lost on the Peabody Estate. Eventually he found the flat and told the jury: ""I just remember standing in front of the building door ringing his flat buzzer. ""I was trying to understand why it was taking so long."" Referred to as CD, he told the jury Mr Brizzi spoke first explaining that they had ""kind of a situation here"". The witness added that Mr Brizzi said somebody was feeling ill or unwell but ""not to worry because they were taking care of it, whoever was there"". ""I asked if there was anything I could do to help and he said no, everything was under control but our party is cancelled"", witness CD told the jury. ""He sounded concerned, a little bit upset. He did not sound too worried. ""To be honest, I thought when I left, somebody was throwing up on his carpet."" The witness, giving evidence anonymously, told jurors they rescheduled their date for the following Friday night, but Mr Brizzi did not confirm. 'Satan told me to' The court has previously heard Mr Brizzi may have cooked and eaten parts of Mr Semple after strangling him. Giving evidence earlier, the police officer who found his remains told the jury the flat smelt strongly of chemicals and ""gone off meat"". PC Charlotte Edwards said the bath was full of ""flesh globules"" floating in murky turquoise water. She added the floor was covered in a ""layer of slime"". The defendant allegedly told the officer he had ""tried to dissolve the body"" and that he had flushed ""flabbery bits"" - taken to mean internal organs - down the toilet five minutes before, the court heard. PC Edwards said Mr Brizzi had told her: ""I've killed a police officer. Satan told me to."" She told jurors he told her a voice told him to ""kill kill kill"". She said, he then told her: ""I didn't know he was a police officer until after I killed him.""

He also presents a show on BBC Radio Two and BBC One's Saturday night show The Getaway Car, which debuted to mixed reviews. He said: ""There is nothing more exciting than hosting live TV on a Saturday night. The show is naturally very close to my heart, after having hosted it for eight years. ""I'm excited to be back."" Thames TV boss Richard Holloway described O'Leary as ""a much-loved part of The X Factor and one of the best presenters in the business"", while ITV director of TV Kevin Lygo said he was ""an important part of the ITV family"".

Coronavirus: Middlesbrough school 'hit hard' by 40 bereavements,"Tom Urwin, principal of the Outwood Academy Ormesby in Middlesbrough, said the global outbreak had been ""really sad"" for his students and staff. The school, which has about 900 pupils, has set up a bereavement service to support children who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. Mr Urwin also said a foodbank set up by staff had sent out more than 300 packs. ""We understand students are vulnerable and unfortunately they suffer from loss,"" he said. ""We have students who lose people throughout the school year but not to the extent of 40. ""That's a combination of parents, aunties, uncles and grandparents. For 40 to be impacted is just huge and really sad."" One pupil at the school, Jack, said it was difficult to know what people were going through and not to be able to ""physically help them"". ""You can still can verbally, but it's hard not to give them a hug or high five them or try and make their day or something,"" he said. Middlesbrough has had one of the highest infection rates in the country with people in the area having a higher risk of dying from the virus. Mr Urwin said none of the staff had suffered bereavements but they would have been affected by the students' losses. ""They know that student so well, they care about them, that's why they became a teacher because they love working with students,"" he said. The school has 160 vulnerable pupils who have been receiving weekly phone calls, out of which came the idea for the foodbank. Mr Urwin said some parents were struggling after being put on furlough or losing their jobs, so staff set up the scheme. ""They put the donations in the office next to mine and it was like walking through a supermarket,"" he said. The school is planning to reopen fully in September with social distancing in place. ""I really hope when September arrives we can ask all students to return,"" Mr Urwin said. ""It's a fresh start and I just want to see as many pupils back as we possibly can.""

Danny Jones sword killing: Oswestry man Richard Reece jailed,"Danny Jones, 21, from Chirk, near Wrexham, died from a single stab wound after he and Richard Reece spent a night out in Oswestry, Shropshire. Reece, 19, from Lord Street in Oswestry, was acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter over the stabbing, which happened in April. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court. The jury heard the two men knew each other well and had spent the night drinking together. They ended up in Oak Street car park and the court was told Mr Jones, a trainee accountant, was stabbed with a 30cm blade - described as an ornamental sword. Martin Lindop, from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said the weapon was a replica short sword from the Lord of the Rings films. Mr Jones died in hospital, while undergoing emergency surgery. In a statement read out in court, Mr Jones's mother described him as a ""special boy"", who she had brought up on her own until he was 13. She said he had a baby son who would now ""never know him"". Det Insp Steve Tonks said his first thoughts were with Mr Jones's family after what he described as ""another sad and pointless death"". ""They have endured a trial lasting more than a fortnight, listening to the huge amount of detailed evidence surrounding Danny's death,"" he said.

Aaron Sillis: Norfolk dancer in Pet Shop Boys' ballet,"Aaron Sillis is one of the three main performers of The Most Incredible Thing, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen. The Sadler's Wells' production was given a standing ovation on its opening preview night on 17 March. ""For a first preview I think it went really, really well,"" said Aaron, who grew up in Drayton, near Norwich. The ballet has its official premiere on Wednesday, but its first stage outing provoked an emotional response from one half of the Pet Shop Boys. ""I saw Neil [Tennant] backstage last night and he was shedding a little tear because they've been working on this for three years,"" said Aaron. Wide audience The Pet Shop Boys' involvement in the ballet has appealed to a wide audience, with some of the duo's fans travelling from abroad for the sellout 10-night run. ""Last night it was a really, really mixed crowd,"" said Aaron. ""It attracted the Sadler's Wells' usual crowd and then you've got this whole new demographic of Pet Shop Boys fans, which is so broad. ""Some I met at the stage door had travelled from Germany and there was someone who had come over from Australia,"" he added. Aaron was asked to be in the ballet two years ago after he won a South Bank Show Breakthrough Award and said he ""jumped at the chance"", having worked with the band before on TV shows and gigs. The Most Incredible Thing brings together a renowned team including controversial choreographer Javier De Frutos, former Royal Ballet principal Ivan Putrov and designer Katrina Lindsay. 'Inspiring' The show has been in production for 10 weeks, with Aaron describing it as a collaborative and inspiring process. Aaron, who attended Taverham High School and Norwich's Central School of Dance, has worked as a dancer and choreographer for some top pop names including Kylie Minogue, Nicole Scherzinger and Mariah Carey. The 28-year-old was also the principal dancer in Matthew Bourne's critically-acclaimed adaptation of Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray and says his latest project bridges the gap between his two worlds. ""It's merging both genres together,"" said Aaron. ""I either work in theatre or I work in the pop domain and this is a bit of both. ""It is a dream project especially if it goes on world tour!"" The amount of press attention that the rare commission of a three-act ballet and the Pet Shop Boys' score has attracted means the various possibilities of UK, European and worldwide roadtrips are already being suggested. Should the show call in to Norwich it would give Aaron a chance to stay with parents Jeremy and Dianne, who still live in Drayton. ""This year I've come back once because we've been doing this project six days a week,"" said Aaron, ""but I love coming home.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Toy firm VTech fined $650,000 over data breach","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) levelled the charges at VTech following a data breach in 2015. While investigating the breach, the FTC found the firm had broken US laws governing the way data about children is gathered. The FTC said VTech also ""failed to take reasonable steps"" to secure that data. 'Falling short' VTech gathered a lot of data about children via its Kid Connect app that was bundled in with many of the electronic toys it makes. Almost 650,000 children downloaded the app and used it in conjunction with VTech's educational toys. The app collected personal information but did so without seeking consent from parents or telling children what data was being collected and the uses to which it would be put, said the FTC. VTech's poor data security practices meant a security researcher could get at the firm's network and take personal information which included customers' names as well as email addresses, it added in its complaint. The hacker was also able to get at an internal database that held copies of encryption keys that, if used, would have let an attacker view photos and audio files uploaded by children and parents. VTech was unaware that its network had been penetrated and data taken until it was contacted by a journalist. ""As connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data,"" said Maureen Ohlhausen, acting FTC chairwoman, in a statement. ""Unfortunately,"" she added, ""VTech fell short in both of these areas."" As well as paying the financial penalty, VTech has pledged to uphold US child data protection laws in future. It has also agreed to improve its security practices and will be subjected to regular independent data and privacy audits for the next 20 years. In a statement, VTech said parents were left in no doubt about the type of information being collected about children and were able to decide who they talked to via the app. It said it collected data only to help users of its products to communicate with each other, not for marketing purposes. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center which campaigns on privacy issues, welcomed the FTC's action but said the penalty could have been levied more swiftly. ""This is good news that the FTC finally took action but we feel like they are moving too slow and clearly following and not leading,"" Mr. Rotenberg told the New York Times.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New 'revenge porn' law comes into force in Scotland,"The Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act now makes it easier to prosecute so-called revenge porn. Women's rights groups said sharing intimate photographs and video caused ""devastating harm"" to victims. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it would give police and prosecutors ""robust powers"" to tackle the issue. The new legislation, which was passed unanimously by MSPs last March, makes it an offence to ""disclose, or threaten to disclose, an intimate photograph or film"" without consent. It comes in response to a growing problem as easy access to devices like smart phones means pictures and videos taken with the expectation of privacy can be now far more easily shared publicly online through outlets such as social media. The new offence: Research commissioned by Scottish Women's Aid found that more than two thirds (78%) of adults believed it should be illegal for someone to share an intimate image they have been sent. More than eight in 10 of those asked said it should be illegal for someone to share an image they have taken, without the consent of the person shown in the image. A new public awareness campaign is being launched to coincide with the legislation coming into force. It will highlight the consequences of sharing intimate photographs or video of a current or former partner without their permission. The campaign has been developed in partnership with Scottish Women's Aid, Rape Crisis Scotland, ASSIST, Police Scotland and the Crown Office - all of whom are involved in dealing with the crime and its consequences. Earlier this year, the Scottish government used hard-hitting posters to raise awareness about the new legislation. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""Social media is great for people keeping in contact but it is also being used in an abusive way by some individuals, particularly around the disclosure of intimate images, or even threatening to disclose intimate images. The legislation that comes into force as of today will make it an offence to actually do so. ""Our police and prosecutors will investigate the issues very thoroughly and, where there is the evidence to do so, they will seek to secure a prosecution through our courts. ""If someone is convicted of this type of offence they could spend up to five years in jail."" Marsha Scott, chief executive of Scottish Women's Aid, said: ""So-called revenge porn is not about revenge, and it's not about porn. It's about power, control and humiliation. ""Sharing, or threatening to share intimate pictures or videos of someone without their consent causes devastating harm to victims and it is absolutely right that the law should reflect this. ""Our research on this showed that most victims of this crime suffered long term anxiety, and some mentioned feelings of self-harm and suicide because their intimate images were shared without their consent. ""The fear and anxiety it creates can creep into every corner of a victim's life and relationships. It's absolutely unacceptable and it is never the victim's fault.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"More UK students consider study abroad, poll suggests","By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter A survey of more than 2,500 students found 37% would take up a degree overseas, compared with 20% in a similar poll last year. Rising tuition fees at home was the main reason for contemplating an education abroad, as well as gaining academic credit and language skills. The United States and Australia were considered the top study destinations. It is difficult to establish exactly how many British students opt to study abroad as there is no central means of collecting this data. However, Unesco research suggests 28,180 British students (just over 1% of the total) were studying overseas in 2012. 'Unique adventure' The British Council survey polled 2,630 students in the UK for their views. Of these, two-thirds (67%) were aged between 18 and 24. In total, 41% said they would not consider studying abroad; this compares with 65% last year. Those who said they would consider studying abroad were asked if the increase in university tuition fees in England had affected them and over half (57%) said it had; this compares with 27% last year. The poll shows the main academic reason for students wanting to study abroad was to gain credit for their field of study (33%), followed by the chance to improve their language skills (26%). There were also non-academic reasons, the British Council found, the most popular being the opportunity to travel overseas (chosen by 20%). This was followed by the chance to have a ""unique adventure"" (19%), to improve job prospects (17%), building self-confidence (15%) and the opportunity to establish international careers (15%). 'Encouraging' The US remains the number one destination for UK students, picked by 33%, followed by Australia (9%), France (5%), Germany (5%) and Canada (4%). Fear of not fitting into other cultures was the greatest non-academic barrier to UK students studying overseas, with about a third (34%) saying this put them off. Dr Jo Beall, the British Council's director of education and society, said: ""It is essential for the UK's global competitiveness that our next generation gain more international skills and understanding, so it's very encouraging to see that more UK students are considering studying abroad. ""The internationalisation of the UK's education sector cannot be a one-way process. More of our young people need to be prepared to travel if we're to catch up with countries like France and Germany.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Clegg - A very botched coup,"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Its instigator has quit the party. The leader he was trying to unseat is secure - for now at least. And the man meant to inherit the crown is wounded - forced to condemn his friend and proclaim his loyalty from thousands of miles away. Matthew Oakeshott has long believed that his party, the Liberal Democrats, were driving at speed towards an electoral brick wall. He has long dreamed of wrenching the wheel from the hands of Nick Clegg and installing in his place his old friend Vince Cable. He has long plotted against Clegg without, we've always been told, Cable's backing but without public criticism from him either. Oakeshott's actions were inspired as much by disagreement about the direction of the Lib Dems as they were by fear of electoral annihilation. A founder of the SDP - formed as a breakaway from Labour in the 1980s - he says he dreamed of creating ""a radical progressive party"". He claims that Nick Clegg has created, instead, a ""split the difference Centre Party, with ...no roots, no principles and no values"". This and other moves against Nick Clegg have allowed the Lib Dem leader to flush out support from MPs and peers - amongst them Vince Cable. Under the rules, it would now take a rebellion by 75 local parties to trigger a leadership contest. Lord Oakeshott's parting shot was to give his backing to those he called ""a few stout-hearted MPs and peers and hundreds, maybe soon thousands, of candidates, councillors and Lib Dem members ... (who) are now fighting constituency by constituency for a leadership election"". Even if that never materialises one question will remain. Having lost almost half their public support, just under half their councillors and all but one of their MEPs what will stop the rot for the Lib Dems if it is not changing their leader? (Since joining the coalition the lib Dems have lost 1700 councillors (43%), 11 MEPs and their vote share has dropped from 23% at the last general election to 13% in the local elections and below 7% in the Euros).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Game on for Plaid Cymru leadership contest?,"By Aled ap DafyddBBC Wales political correspondent I was told on Twitter this week that stories about the leadership of Plaid Cymru were as a result of ""media stirring"". Here is my case for the defence and why I think there will be a three-way battle for the top job. Much was made on Tuesday of Rhun ap Iorwerth's remarks denying any plan to challenge Leanne Wood, but here's some context. Plaid have an official window whereby any member of the assembly group can put their names forward for the leadership. It comes around every two years and it's open for another three weeks. The party also have a weekly news briefing with journalists, each member of the group taking it in turn to appear. What an opportune time it was to ask Mr ap Iorwerth about his intentions. ""No plans to challenge"" he said, as question after question honed in on the same subject. What else could he say? Some took it to be a categorical assurance that he wouldn't challenge Leanne Wood. ""Plans"" change, of course, and I suspect they changed 24 hours later. That's when an emboldened Leanne Wood said she would ""welcome"" a challenge. In a BBC interview she mentioned Rhun ap Iorwerth by name and her opposition to the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station became evident. It's a project he's supporting. It all amounted to what looks like a ""put up or shut up"" strategy and opened the door for ""plans"" to change. Those close to Rhun ap Iorwerth say he's coming under increasing pressure to stand; that was Wednesday night, by the way. On Thursday morning sources close to Adam Price were saying the same thing. He's got the backing of councillors and constituency parties in Carmarthenshire already. But does he want it? Mr Price, currently on paternity leave, hasn't come under the same amount of scrutiny as his potential rivals this week. In 2016 he was described by MP Jonathan Edwards as a ""once in a generation politician … an X factor politician"", labelled by some the ""Mab Darogan"" - prophetic son - of Welsh folklore. Mr Edwards, as it happened, led Ms Wood's leadership campaign in 2012. It could be awkward. So here's what will happen next - a drip, drip of stories about calls for both Rhun ap Iorwerth and Adam Price to stand. Watch out for something along the lines of ""it's impossible to ignore what the members want"" or ""because Leanne has welcomed a challenge"". Three AMs have already signed a letter urging colleagues to stand. It gives the challengers a way in to the contest, and the incumbent will at least have clarity about her position at the end of the process. Behind the scenes I suspect it's game on already.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US government set to give up net oversight powers,"The US Commerce Department has announced its ""intent"" to hand control over to the wider net community. It has asked net overseer Icann to work out how to shift control from the US government to an alternative body. It said it wants the successor controlling body to be made up of both private companies and government representatives. 'Critical' time The way the internet came about meant the US retained ultimate control over how the network was operated. The process of stepping back from that began in 1998 with the creation of Icann (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Under contract from the US government, Icann oversees the net's addressing system that underlies everything people do online. Now it wants to go further and let Icann run that addressing system without any US interference. In a statement setting out its plan, assistant secretary of commerce Lawrence Strickling said the handover must ""support and enhance the multistakeholder model"" for the governing of the net as well as maintain its openness. Dr Stephen Crocker, chairman of Icann's board, said the day the net would be free of US oversight had been ""long envisioned"". ""We have all long known the destination,"" he said in a statement. ""Now it is up to our global stakeholder community to determine the best route to get us there."" He said Icann had issued invitations to governments, companies, net organisations and civil groups to help it work out how the transfer of power should be accomplished. Icann said the new body should be in place by September 2015 when its current contract with the US government expires. Calls for the US to have less of a role in the running of the net have intensified in recent months as whistle-blower Edward Snowden has leaked information about the extent of surveillance by America's National Security Agency. In February, Neelie Kroes, the European Union commissioner who oversees telecommunications policy, said US oversight had to end. In a more recent statement, she welcomed the US decision to hand over control and said: ""The next two years will be critical in redrawing the map of internet governance - all those with an interest in preserving a trusted, free and open internet must act now.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Walsall Acorns children's hospice to close,"Acorns in Walsall, which looked after 200 children in the last year, could shut at the beginning of October. Chief executive Toby Porter said he was not hiding the ""devastating impact"" the closure would have, adding it was ""desperately sad"" but ""the right decision"". Staff and families have been told and care will be transferred to Acorns sites in Birmingham and Worcester. The charity cared for about 800 children, plus their families, across the West Midlands last year. A month-long consultation with staff in Walsall has started. About 70 people could lose their jobs. Mr Porter said it had been ""a bad year"" for the charity and there were not sufficient cash reserves to support three hospices. He said the cost of delivering care ""was far higher than the total we've managed to raise"". ""We're not hiding the devastating impact it will have,"" he said, particularly for the 20 to 30 families who regularly have day sessions at the Walsall centre. Gemma Harris uses the service for her daughter Remi, who is severely disabled. She said: ""If it closes I'd lose my safety net. I've got no family or friends who know how to tube feed her at the moment. ""If I lose a place like Acorns I'm completely stuck and it means that me and my partner would never have a rest from Remi's needs. ""It makes me sick the fact that everything revolves around money and government funding - us parents with children with disabilities have to fight for everything and everything is based on money anyway for the most vulnerable in society. ""And knowing now that this charity is going that is an absolutely vital source for parents like us, it's just sickening."" Acorns opened its Walsall hospice in 1999. The charity said it cost £10m a year to run its three sites. Current spending figures are still being audited, but a spokesman said it looked likely that the charity's 2018-19 spending would exceed income by £1.6m. He added the charity had seen a drop in funds raised by its shops and from wills. The shortfall would usually be met by charitable reserves but this figure reduced from £3.8m in 2018 to £2.2m at the end of March this year, and the charity trustees concluded they could not risk reserves falling further. Tracey Bleakley, chief executive of Hospice UK, said costs were rising in general due to ""increasing complexity of care"", with hospices ""operating in a very tough fundraising environment"". ""Difficult conditions on the high street are also adversely affecting income from hospice shops,"" she added. Mark Lyttle, whose daughter Isabella used the service before her death in April, said: ""I describe the staff there as friends and family. ""They've held our hands and looked after us in some really dark times. The place is defined by love.""

Sri Lankan PM gets JVP support,"The pre-poll deal includes a commitment to retain a unitary state in Sri Lanka, redraft a ceasefire with Tamil Tigers and to stop privatisation. In return the JVP, who pulled out of the government this year complaining about concessions to the Tigers, will support Mr Rajapakse's election bid. Elections are due by the end of 2005. ""It is agreed to protect, defend and preserve the unitary nature of the Sri Lankan state under any solution to be presented, formed or formulated for the purpose of the resolution of the national question,"" the agreement states. The deal is strongly opposed by the incumbent president Chandrika Kumaratunga, who comes from the same party - the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) - as Mr Rajapakse. Ms Kumaratunga, who attracted the ire of the JVP after agreeing a deal to share post-tsunami aid with the Tigers, said on Wednesday that she would not ""throw away 11 years of work in a mere election promise"". The deal signed on Thursday also commits Mr Rajapakse, if elected, to scrap the post-tsunami aid-sharing deal. But senior members of the SLFP have said that the deal signed on Thursday is not 'final'. Alavi Moulana, deputy leader of the SLFP and governor of the Western Provincial council, told the BBC Tamil service that the deal could be ""re-evaluated, re-analysed"". ""What has been agreed,"" he said, ""are personal wishes and opinions...no one can be objecting to personal wishes"". 'Not afraid' Prime Minister Rajapakse rejected criticisms that the agreement, signed formally on Thursday after an earlier verbal agreement, could lead back to war with the Tamil Tigers. ""This agreement will not lead to war but peace, prosperity and development for all,"" he said. Leader of the JVP - or People's Liberation Front - Somawansa Amarasinghe said that his party were not afraid of war. ""You can't bring peace by being afraid of war,"" he said. The elections have been prompted by a Supreme Court ruling stating that President Chandrika Kumaratunga's term ends in December. Under the constitution, she is barred from contesting a third term. Policy differences President Kumaratunga was at the helm during six rounds of peace talks with the Tamil Tigers. Those talks broke down in 2003, but before then both sides had made an unprecedented agreement to work towards a federal solution of the conflict on the island. Mr Rajapakse's main opponent in the presidential elections is former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Mr Wickremesinghe is campaigning on a platform of reviving the peace process with the Tigers and continuing policies of economic liberalisation. More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka since the Tamil Tigers launched their campaign for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island in 1983.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mike Ashley dismisses claim he offered expert £15m as nonsense,"Investment banker Jeffrey Blue said the Newcastle United owner promised to pay him £15m if he increased Sports Direct's share price to £8 each. He was paid £1m but is suing Mr Ashley for the rest at London's High Court. Mr Ashley said it ""would be obvious"" to anyone at the pub where they were drinking that he ""was not serious"". Mr Ashley told Mr Justice Leggatt, in a witness statement, he met Mr Blue and three other finance specialists at the Horse And Groom pub in central London in January 2013. 'A lot of banter' ""When we got to the pub we started drinking heavily at the bar and consumed a lot of alcohol during the evening,"" Mr Ashley told the judge. ""We must have had four or five rounds of drinks in the first hour. ""I can't remember the detail of conversations but I do remember that we had a lot of drinks and a lot of banter. ""We were pulling each other's legs about what hypothetical value my shares would be worth 'on paper' at different share prices. ""It was a fun night, as it was intended to be, and everyone was on good form."" Mr Ashley said the group went to another bar afterwards but could not remember which one. He said: ""I find it incredible that Mr Blue is actually suggesting that I made a binding agreement for £15m. ""It's nonsense. ""If I did say to Mr Blue that I would pay him £15m, it would be obvious to everyone, including Mr Blue, that I wasn't being serious."" 'Decisions in bath' Mr Ashley said the inference that Sports Direct had senior management meetings in a pub was ""100% incorrect"". He said he occasionally made decisions in a pub. ""Definitely not as a norm,"" he said. ""Otherwise I would have to live in a pub."" He added: ""I take business decisions all day every day, from home, from the bath."" Mr Ashley told the judge: ""Serious, serious decisions are not done on drunken nights out."" What Mr Blue called ""senior management meetings"" at pubs was actually just a ""drink after work"", Mr Ashley said. He also said ""going for a drink"" was ""what we do after work"" and Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where Sports Direct is based, was a ""very boring, lonely place"".

"Autism is largely down to genes, twins study suggests","By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The King's College London team said 181 of the teenagers had autism, but the risk was far higher in identical twins where one twin had autism, as they share the same DNA. The researchers told JAMA Psychiatry that hundreds of genes were involved. But they do not rule out environmental factors. Both twins in each pair had been raised by their parents in the same household. Increased awareness Autism can be tricky to diagnose. It is a spectrum of conditions rather than a single disorder, and its severity can vary widely from person to person. Researcher Dr Francesca Happe said, although not perfect, all the evidence pointed to genes playing a bigger role in autism than previously thought. ""Our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism. ""Some people think there might be a big environmental component because autism has become more common in recent years but that's happened too fast for genetics to be a probable cause. ""The main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition."" Full lives Dr Happe said what might have been labelled as a learning disability in the past was now being correctly diagnosed as autism. She said lots of scientists were working to determine which precise genes were involved in autism and whether they were inherited. ""There may be perhaps hundreds of genes that contribute to autistic traits,"" she said. Dr Judith Brown, of the National Autistic Society, said: ""Autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes, but with non-genetic factors too. ""This large population-based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share. ""However, we are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism. ""What people with condition, their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives."" Autism What is autism?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
George Osborne to step down as Evening Standard editor,"Osborne took on the job in March 2017, after having held the nation's purse-strings from 2010-2016. His replacement is Emily Sheffield, a columnist on the newspaper, BBC Media Editor Amol Rajan confirmed. Osborne is moving to the more managerial role of the newspaper's editor-in-chief. Rajan said the print title will continue for now but is in ""desperate financial trouble"". In response, the incoming editor tweeted that the newspaper ""remains a core element to this outstanding legacy news organisation. ""It has survived this crisis and it will survive many more,"" added Sheffield. The newspaper's owner, Evgeny Lebedev, said he was ""delighted"" Sheffield was taking the helm at the newspaper and was ""very pleased"" Osborne would be editor-in-chief. Osborne thanked his colleagues at the newspaper and said of his replacement: ""She will bring creativity, commitment and experience to the job - and take the Standard, online and in print, through the next exciting chapter in its long history."" Osborne is also chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership and holds a £650,000-a-year post advising the investment fund BlackRock. Last year he was made chairman of a panel of advisers to Exor, which owns the Italian football club Juventus and has major stakes in Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler cars. Osborne left government in 2016 after the Brexit referendum and he stood down as MP for Tatton in Cheshire in 2017. According to The Guardian, prior to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Evening Standard's circulation was about 800,000 daily copies in the capital, but it was struggling due to an industry-wide decline in advertising revenues. Due to its reliance on readers using public transport, the Evening Standard was reported to have distributed just over 423,000 copies a day in April, after the nation went into lockdown. Osborne's replacement, Sheffield, will remain director of a female news brand she launched called This Much I Know, and will be ""tasked with making it a digital first operation"" added Rajan. ""That's a extremely difficult challenge for a title so heavily dependent on print for its income,"" he tweeted. ""As an ad-funded title reliant on footfall, the Standard has been devastated by the pandemic."" Last month the industry's auditor said newspapers will no longer have their sales figures automatically published. The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), which records and audits sales, usually publishes figures every month.

Another Cardiff Bay private flat block fails cladding test,"By David DeansBBC News Cardiff council said it was concerned about the results of tests on cladding at Quayside Apartments at Bute Place. Aluminium composite material (ACM) - which has been subject to scrutiny since June's Grenfell Tower disaster - was used on part of the building. Bellway, which built the block of 79 flats, said it would review its design. The news comes after cladding at six apartment buildings at Cardiff's privately-owned Prospect Place site and social housing towers in Newport failed fire safety tests. 'Concerned' The tests on ACM cladding, conducted by the Building Research Establishment (BRE), were introduced after the Grenfell tower block fire in London. The company that manages the block, Warwick Estates, said the cladding affects one side of the building. Cardiff council said it is ""aware and concerned"" that tests on the cladding system of the Quayside Apartments development in Cardiff Bay ""identified the presence"" of aluminium composite material (ACM), which has failed BRE tests. ""Responsibility for the safety of any buildings is clearly a matter for the development's owner,"" said a council spokeswoman. ""We are in contact with Welsh Government and have offered our support should it be required. ""As the local housing authority we will need to consider the appropriate approach to provide support and promote action to address any serious hazards identified that pose a risk to health and safety."" 'Doubt' The property was originally constructed by Bellway Homes, which also built the Prospect Place development. A spokeswoman said it is now not the owner or responsible for the building, but said: ""We have been supporting and providing any information requested from the managers responsible for the building and remain willing to actively support them as required. ""Quayside is a development we are proud of and whilst we obtained building control approval when the buildings were designed and constructed, we appreciate doubt is now cast over industry and regulator decisions at the time. ""We are undertaking our own detailed review of our original designs using specialist consultants as advised by government in order to assess whether the ACM cladding will need to be removed."" Management company Warwick Estates said ""interim measures"" are in place in accordance with guidance from the UK government following Grenfell.

Killer Brett Rogers' mum had 'no choice' in having him back home,"Brett Rogers murdered Gillian Phillips, 54, and David Oakes, 60, at her home in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, in 2015. Rogers, who was subsequently killed in prison in 2017, had been freed just weeks earlier for attacking his father. A domestic homicide review was told she felt under pressure to take her son in, despite initially saying she would not. Rogers was 23 and on licence when he stabbed his mother more than 40 times and Mr Oakes - who she had been caring for - 56 times. Uttlesford Community Safety Partnership ordered the review, which looked at the prisons and probation service, health care, police, housing as well as alcohol and drugs services. It has been released alongside an NHS England-commissioned independent investigation due to Rogers' extensive involvement with the former North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (NEP). Rogers was released halfway through a five-year jail sentence in April 2015 for breaking his father's cheek bone and eye socket. Between April 2010 and March 2012 police were called 14 times to the home of Mrs Phillips, who was separated from Rogers' father, the report said. It also told how the long-term drug user displayed psychotic behaviour, had been convicted twice of damaging his parents' properties, repeatedly made threats to kill and was sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act. On one occasion it took six police officers to restrain him, the report said. The author concluded although Rogers was ""not a cause for concern"" for authorities on release, he posed a ""clear and recognised risk to his family"". Mrs Phillips had ""felt pressured"" not to leave her son homeless, but ""it was not a safe option, given his history of aggression, violence and abuse against both parents,"" the review said. ""The responsibility should not have fallen to her."" The report also noted that the family said they had not received proper support from the mental health trust, while its ""exclusive focus"" on Rogers' mental health ""led to missed opportunities to respond to the domestic abuse he was responsible for"". Thirteen recommendations have now been made to various agencies, which must report back on progress.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nigel Farage says Labour has 'abandoned' its pro-Brexit voters,"By James WilliamsBBC Wales Brexit correspondent He said his party will challenge ""in seat after seat"" because Labour has ""completely abandoned"" its Brexit-supporting voters. Mr Farage said the Brexit Party's comfortable victory in Wales in May's European elections was a ""good start"". He was speaking at a Brexit Party rally in Newport on Saturday. Several speakers at the rally were critical of Boris Johnson's attempt to reach a fresh Brexit deal with the European Union, labelling it ""the worst deal in history"". The prime minister is in talks with the EU to remove the controversial ""backstop"" - an insurance policy to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - from Theresa May's Brexit deal. Mr Farage said: ""If we go down that route, we are in for years and years of acrimony because we won't have left anything."" He told his audience he could not think of a part of the UK ""less represented"" than Wales, saying only one of the 40 Welsh MPs - Conservative David Jones - had consistently voted against Mrs May's Brexit deal in the House of Commons. Asked by BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme if his party would be targeting Labour seats in a general election, Mr Farage said: ""Absolutely, no question about it. ""We didn't just make a good start in the European elections - looking at polling right now, we are the challengers to Labour here in seat after seat."" In December 2014, when Mr Farage was leading UKIP, he told BBC Wales that his party at the time would be targeting seven or eight Welsh seats in a general election. But in the 2015 election, UKIP failed to make a breakthrough. Mr Farage said the circumstances had changed, claiming ""Labour at that stage hadn't actually directly betrayed their own voters"". ""There was a sense and a feeling that a London-led Labour Party was out of touch with its old traditional seats, but now it's there for all to see,"" he said. ""The Labour Party wants a second referendum, the movement within the party to be all-out Remain is there, and we'll see it at the conference this week,"" he added.

Sri Lanka clashes hit peace hopes,"A ""large number"" of rebels also died and more than 100 troops were wounded in the clashes in northern Jaffna peninsula, an army statement said. The rebels said 75 soldiers died and that 10 of their fighters were killed. On Tuesday, the two sides finalised a date and venue for talks later this month - which the BBC's Dumeetha Luthra says are now hanging in the balance. The Tigers have said they are currently considering their position but have not pulled out. The country's key backers have requested a cessation of hostilities before talks begin. Artillery fire Wednesday's casualty figures are among the highest the Sri Lankan military has endured in a single day's fighting since hostilities resumed earlier this year. Fierce clashes between troops and rebels lasted up to 12 hours, with residents in the town of Jaffna saying they could hear the noise of heavy artillery in the distance. An army statement said at least 113 injured soldiers were being evacuated for treatment after a lull in fighting. ""Ground troops confirmed that a large number of terrorist dead bodies were also found scattered around,"" it added. The military said its forces had responded to rebel attacks with artillery and air raids against rebel gun positions. For their part, the rebels accused the military of stepping up attacks first, saying troops had begun a ""large-scale operation along the northern defence line"". ""Our forces have repulsed their attacks. The bodies of more than 75 soldiers are scattered around in areas under our control,"" rebel military spokesman Rasaiah Ilanthiraiyan told the BBC Tamil service. He said a soldier was captured by them and was identified as Samantha Weerasinghe of Gemunu watch. Both sides maintain they are acting defensively, our correspondent says, and have retained the right to do so despite agreeing to resume discussions. Talks Sri Lanka has been close to peace talks before, only for them to fail at the last minute. On Tuesday, Norway's ambassador to Sri Lanka, Hans Brattskar, told the BBC that the rebels had confirmed they were ready to meet the government on 28 and 29 October in Switzerland. However, he said the Tigers had told him they could reconsider their decision if the situation on the ground deteriorated. Last week, the Sri Lankan government outlined plans for a 40% increase in defence spending for 2007, to cover increased weapons procurement and air strike costs. Thousands of civilians have been caught up in the latest violence, in which hundreds of people have died this year. The government says it wants to discuss substantive issues which would lead to a long-term solution.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"'Kylie Jenner, wow, being in a wheelchair is so fun and fashionable!'","By BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why The image was one of several showing the able-bodied television personality - famous for the series Keeping up with the Kardashians - in various poses for US magazine Interview. But when the pictures were published on Tuesday, and shared on Facebook, many wheelchair users expressed outrage - and used the picture as a way to share their experience of using a wheelchair. There have been thousands of messages across social networks. The most intense reaction to the image came from people who reported being discriminated against because of their disability. Follow BBC Trending on Facebook Join the conversation on this and other stories here. Others began posting pictures of models who genuinely need a wheelchair, to point out the wheelchair is often much more than a prop. One of the most shared images on social media was from 17-year-old Ophelia Brown. ""I wanted to show her that being in a wheelchair is not glamorous or fashionable or fun,"" she told BBC Trending. Her picture, showing her in her chair next to the the image of Jenner, was widely retweeted. Ophelia, who uses a wheelchair to deal with complex regional pain syndrome, spoke from her home in Ottawa, Canada. ""When I first saw the picture, my response was that I didn't think she fully understood what a wheelchair was. A wheelchair is a big part of my life and she seemed to be sitting on it for fun or to look more edgy and cool."" ""I felt overwhelmed with annoyance and jealously that she could just get in and out of a wheelchair,"" she says Her remark was retweeted thousands of times, but there was a negative backlash too - Ophelia says she was also subjected to so much abuse on Twitter that she even made her profile private for a short while. ""One of the worst was someone saying that I was just jealous, and why didn't I just roll myself into a wall,"" she says. But she doesn't regret making her comment.

New Aberdeen FC Kingsford stadium plans approved,"The club wants to construct the £50m stadium and training facilities at Kingsford, near Westhill. The plans were put on hold last October. Aberdeen FC says the new facilities are vital to its future. Objectors say the stadium should be located elsewhere. Planners backed the project, and councillors voted 32-9 in favour on Monday afternoon. Objectors will now pursue a judicial review. Aberdeen FC chairman Stewart Milne, said: ""After 17 years, we are one step closer to a new home that will allow us to meet our vision and ambition for Aberdeen Football Club, our city and our region. ""We applaud the councillors for taking this decision in the face of considerable objections. ""We are fully aware of and sympathetic to those in Westhill and Kingswells who have objected to our plans and I want to reassure them once more that we want to engage with them to deliver community facilities they can all enjoy and benefit from."" The No Kingsford Stadium protest group said they had funds in place for a judicial review. The organisation said in a statement: ""No Kingsford Stadium has worked tirelessly to prevent the approval of this application. ""We have shown that the application is contrary to the development plan. ""It is our view that council officials and councillors have failed in their duty to apply the law in this case and we will now progress our petition for judicial review."" Councillors debated a motion supporting the recommendation of planners and an amendment from councillor Marie Boulton, who wanted the application to be rejected. Aberdeenshire Council had earlier objected to the plans. Senior planner Gavin Evans told councillors that Aberdeenshire Council could effectively still stop the application, over the issue of controlled parking zones. It has been claimed the stadium and training ground would create more than 400 jobs and bring millions of pounds into the local economy. Objections have been raised on grounds including potential traffic issues and loss of green belt land. Planners noted in their report: ""Should members resolve to approve the application, due to the objection from Aberdeenshire Council, formal notification must be given to Scottish ministers, who would then have the opportunity to 'call-in' the application for determination.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Radio 2 reveals the best-selling albums of the 21st Century,"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The record, which features the hits Rolling In The Deep and Someone Like You, is more than a million copies ahead of the second biggest-seller, Amy Winehouse's Back To Black. Adele also takes third place in the chart, with her most recent record, 25. The century's 40 biggest albums were revealed on Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, as part of National Album Day. Ed Sheeran appears in the top five twice too, while other artists in the top 20 include Coldplay, Kings of Leon, Lady Gaga and Scissor Sisters. Even with streaming taken into account, albums from the first decade of the century dominate the chart, making up 28 of the top 40. David Gray's White Ladder is the only record in the list to have been released before 2000 - having first been issued on his own label HIT Records in 1998, before being re-released in the early months of the new millennium. Radio 2's head of music Jeff Smith said it was ""heartening"" to see that 70% of the artists in the Top 40 were British, ""proving that home-grown music is still as popular as ever"". Album listening in decline National Album Day was launched last year to mark the 70th anniversary of the album format. This year's theme is ""don't skip"", encouraging people to appreciate ""the benefits of taking time out to listen to an album from start to finish"". The idea is to challenge the cherry-picking approach to music listening that first took hold with the advent of the iPod in 2001. A recent study by streaming service Deezer found 15% of people below the age of 25 had never listened to an album all the way through. The survey of more than 2000 UK-based adults, found that 42% of people simply opted for playlists - either their own, or ones curated by streaming services - rather than playing albums in full. However, a separate study revealed that listening to an album is one of the best ways to de-stress - beating activities like gardening, exercising or taking a nap. According to a survey of 2,019 adults, listening to an album was the third most-popular activity for improving mood and mental well-being, after comfort-eating and reading (which came first). Bear in mind the research was commissioned by music industry body the BPI and the Entertainment Retailers Association to mark National Album Day, so treat the findings accordingly.

South Georgia whaling: Antarctic art marks a dark past,"By Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News That will now be commemorated by a series of sculptures set to become one of the most remote art installations on Earth. Scottish artist Michael Visocchi, has been chosen to create a piece called Commensalis: The spirit tables of South Georgia. It will be constructed at Grytviken, once the largest whaling station. The South Georgia Heritage Trust and the government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands say the design celebrates ""the ecological recovery of an island that was once at the centre of the whaling industry"". Mr Visocchi described it as an opportunity to ""engage with a particularly poignant story"". ""Quite early on I made the connection between the rivets that hold the sites - and of course the whaling vessels - together, and how they resemble the barnacles [on whales' skin],"" he explained during an online press conference. ""So I used the rivet as a unit to express the numbers of whales taken and the number that have recovered."" In entering the competition, he proposed placing a series of large, low, round tables - covered in these whale-accounting rivets - in a wide area that was formerly used to slice skin from the whales. ""I call these the spirit tables. Each table will represent a species of whale that was hunted and processed on South Georgia,"" said the artist. As well as killing thousands of whales, the industry devastated the island's bird population, as the ships brought invasive rodents ashore. After a vast extermination project, scientists declared the island rodent-free in 2018. Alison Neil, chief executive of the South Georgia Heritage Trust, said the installation would ""sit at the heart of the work we are embarking on as part of a cultural heritage programme to tell the world more about the human story on South Georgia"". The charity says the island is now a conservation ""beacon"" - an island ecosystem in recovery. Once caught and killed in their thousands, humpbacks and even rare blue whales are now returning to South Georgia's waters. Delayed - like so many projects - by the pandemic, Mr Visocchi will visit the site to start planning the construction in autumn 2021. Follow Victoria on Twitter",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Colombia and Farc rebels chart course for peace talks,"In a televised address, Mr Santos said there was ""a real opportunity to end the conflict"". Farc leader Rodrigo Londono later issued a video message saying the rebels would continue to negotiate until peace had been achieved. The talks are to begin in Norway next month and then move to Cuba. Flanked by the commanders of the armed forces and the police, President Santos asked Colombians to give the peace process a chance. He said that as president, he could not let pass an opportunity to end the 48-year-old conflict, ""especially in light of the millions of people who had suffered"". Mr Santos said the peace process would not be easy. In a reference to the last round of negotiations which ended in failure 10 years ago, he stressed that there would be no ceasefire and no safe haven for the rebels this time. From Oslo to Havana Half-an-hour after the president's address, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) showed journalists assembled in the Cuban capital Havana a video message from their leader, Rodrigo Londono, better known as Timochenko. Also referring to the failed peace talks a decade ago, Timochenko asked how many deaths the government had been willing to incur before it was ready to re-open negotiations. He insisted peace could only come about as a result of ""true reconciliation"" and with the participation of all sectors of society. Timochenko said that neither he nor President Santos held the key to peace, but that the people did. While President Santos had pointed out in his address that the government would regularly assess the negotiations and pull out if they were stalling, Timochenko said his team would not ""get up from the negotiating table until peace had been achieved"". Timochenko then listed the names of Farc leaders who have died or been killed since the conflict began in 1964. Under Mr Santos' predecessor, Alvaro Uribe - in power between 2002 and 2010 - the Colombian government refused to hold talks with the Farc. The fresh talks are scheduled to be officially opened in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, at the beginning of October, after which they will move to Havana, in Cuba. US President Barack Obama welcomed the announcement and hailed the ""courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governments - and most especially of the Colombian people - in achieving this milestone"". Since 2000 the US has spent $6bn (£3.8bn) on Plan Colombia, an initiative to help the Colombian government combat drug trafficking and terrorism. Plan Colombia has been criticised by human rights groups who say Colombia's rebels have been disproportionately targeted in Plan Colombia, though it is right-wing paramilitaries who have been most involved in drug-trafficking.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Court action threatened over school meal vouchers,"By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC Radio 4 Today Normally children only get free meals from school during term-time. But eligible pupils received food vouchers over Easter as the country coped with the Covid crisis. The Department for Education said the scheme will not continue in the summer holidays but campaigners say children in vulnerable families will go hungry. They have written to the Department of Education threatening to bring a judicial review of the decision. The letter was sent by the food charity Sustain and the Good Law Project, led by the campaigning lawyer Jolyon Maugham. Kath Dalmeny of Sustain said: ""I have spent hours and hours and hours of my time on Zoom meetings, on phone calls trying to get this issue noticed by all other means. That has not worked and so we must make people take this seriously."" But no legal challenge has yet begun, they do not yet have a court date or the funds to complete a case, and many attempted judicial reviews fail. The voucher scheme has cost more than £129m in England already and is worth £15 per week for each eligible child. One woman, Daisy, who has two children, said the amount and standard of food they ate would have to be cut without the vouchers. ""Having that fifteen pounds a week is a big deal,"" she told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. Mother-of-four Aimee Smith said she relied on the money. When funds have run short in the past, she said: ""I've just had to give them plain pasta, if we haven't had anything else."" She said she often went without meals or had a piece of toast to make sure there was enough left for her children. ""That's what we will call a dinner for the night,"" she said. ""Not being able to eat, it's not a nice thought, is it?"" In a statement, a Department for Education spokesperson said as schools opened more widely the government expected them to make food parcels available for children who are eligible for free school meals but not yet back in the classroom. ""Where this is not possible, schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils,"" the spokesperson said. ""The national voucher scheme will not run during the summer holidays."" In Wales, families have been promised free school meals will be provided until schools re-open or until the end of August.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Arrests as fracking gets green light at Preston New Road site,"The two men and four women locked themselves together at Preston New Road in Little Plumpton at 07:00 BST. Shale company Cuadrilla has been granted permission to start fracking at the site subject to certain conditions. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said all the necessary environmental and health and safety measures has been met. But other conditions have to be met, including supplying the Business and Energy Department with the latest accounts for co-investor Spirit Energy, or a deposit in support of any potential liabilities for decommissioning costs. Ms Perry said: ""We already have an excellent, long-standing reputation for safe oil and gas exploration. ""Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities. ""I have carefully considered Cuadrilla's application and I am content that hydraulic fracturing consent should be granted in this instance."" Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, said the decision was ""a testament to, and underpinned by, our strong track record of running a world-class shale gas exploration site"". But environmental charity Friends of the Earth said it was a ""reckless and climate wrecking decision"". The Preston New Road site has been the subject of continuing protests from local people and campaigners who object to hydraulic fracturing - in which liquid is pumped at high pressure deep underground to fracture rock and release gas. A spokesman for those arrested earlier said they had deliberately breached an injunction preventing trespassers to highlight Cuadrilla's ""abuse of the law"". Cuadrilla said the six had ""unlawfully blocked the entrance"". The company said it respected ""the right to peaceful and lawful protest"" but the campaigners had chosen to trespass despite being ""specifically aware"" of the injunction. The disruption meant suppliers moving to and from the shale gas exploration site were being delayed, Caudrilla said. A spokesman for the protesters said: ""This industry has gone to extreme and expensive lengths to manipulate the law, via a court injunction, to prevent protest in meaningful forms."" Anti-fracking protests have taken place at the site for several months but this is the first challenge to the injunction since it was extended until 2020 earlier in July.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poorer seven-year-old pupils' improvement short of target,"By Bethan LewisBBC Wales education correspondent Despite year-on-year improvements, the numbers of pupils on free school meals reaching the foundation phase indicator fell short of the 80% target. It was set two years ago after initial targets were hit three years early. The Welsh Government said reducing the gap between poorer pupils and their classmates was at the heart of its national mission to raise standards. Pupils in the ""learning through play"" early years are assessed on their personal and social development, literacy and communication skills, as well as how they are developing in maths. Latest figures show 75.9% of seven-year-old pupils from lower income families achieved the expected level at the end of the foundation phase. And although the gap between those who receive free school meals and those who do not has narrowed to 14.3%, that too fell short of the target. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: ""Right across the UK too often people's life chances are determined by their family's background. ""All our education reforms, such as reducing class sizes, curriculum reform, and supporting rural schools, are intrinsically linked to addressing this injustice. ""While the attainment gap for our youngest learners has narrowed over recent years, there is no room for complacency."" She said an extension of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG), doubling the financial support to early years learners in the Foundation Phase would help reach the disadvantaged learners ""at the earliest possible stage"". Statisticians say it is not possible to assess whether a separate target for raising attainment at GCSE has been met because of changes to the data. The gap in performance increases at every stage of school, and by Year 11 there is a difference of more than 30% in achievement at GCSE. Welsh Government statistics show the percentage of pupils from lower income families who got five good GCSEs including English or Welsh and Maths is 28.6%. After narrowing in previous years, the gap with pupils who did not receive free school meals has widened to 32.4% - up from 31.2% in 2016. Children's Commissioner Sally Holland says there is ""no simple answer"" to closing the gap but schools can make a difference. ""There's a lot that can happen in the school, in the classroom, that can make a difference because we know some schools do narrow that gap and do it really well,"" she said. ""But I think it's really important to remember that what happens in the classroom - especially by the time children get to secondary school - is not the only issue here."" Ms Holland said by the time children started primary school those from the poorest backgrounds could be 18 months behind those from the richest backgrounds in their development. ""So we know that early years intervention is one of the most important things we can do to help children from all backgrounds to succeed,"" she added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Medicine supply chains to change post Brexit, MPs told","By Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI Political Correspondent They were also assured there will be no disruption to the availability of drugs and the current safety standards will be maintained. Members of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee heard evidence on Wednesday from the pharmaceutical industry. It focused on the impact of Brexit on the supply of medical drugs. They were told at present 80% of drugs come into Northern Ireland from Great Britain through the ports, but that in the future medicines are likely to be ""shipped in directly from Europe"". Dr Richard Greville, director of distribution and supply with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry told MP's nothing will change until the end of next year. This is due to a one year ""phasing in"" period agreed between the UK and EU. 'Ducks in a row' Under the protocol. Northern Ireland will stay under the EU regulatory regime for medicines following the end of the transition period. ""This extra time is particularly helpful and useful for everybody to get their ducks in a row to ensure continuity of supply in Northern Ireland,"" said Dr Greville. ""It gives the appropriate and sufficient time to change supply chains, because those supply chains will need to be changed significantly."" He added: ""It may be that in future that companies, manufacturers would need to make contractual arrangements with wholesalers not necessarily the ones that they currently use in GB, but may choose to distribute via for example through the Republic."" Dr Greville told MP's that medicines sold in Northern Ireland will have to carry a unique identifier under EU regulations which protect against counterfeit drugs. But packs of medicines produced in Great Britain will not have the ""obligation of using this unique identifier"". ""So basically what I'm saying is that in the future, Northern Ireland will have to be supplied with packs of medicines that are compliant, if not from GB from other parts of Europe,"" said Dr Greville. ""That is part of the work that individual companies will have to work through next year."" He stressed there will be no ""impact in terms of quality of patient safety"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
In the media: Obama endorses gay marriage,"Writing for the New Yorker, Richard Socarides says that President Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage was based on political considerations. ""Clearly, until today, the president had been making a political calculation - one that had outlived its usefulness. In some ways, it's amazing that he was able to maintain a not-yes-but-not-no position for as long as he did. While it was a useful electoral strategy, changes in public opinion and in the culture have created a new reality."" Meanwhile, the New York Times' Frank Bruni writes that the president's comments have great historic and emotional significance. ""Over recent days it has been observed that the president's position on this didn't and wouldn't make immediate or enormous difference in the actual law of the land. That remains true. States decide on marriage - as North Carolina did, regressively, on Tuesday - and no signal or word from the president is going to translate into the legalisation of same-sex marriage from coast to coast. But that doesn't diminish the emotional importance of what just happened."" Others, such as Jonathan Bernstein for the Washington Post have played down the importance of President Obama's comments. ""At the margins, Obama's new position makes him slightly more prepared for the fall campaign; should marriage hit the headlines (say, from a major court decision), it's probably easier for him to talk about it now than it was under his old position. And I'm not saying that social issues overall are not important politically. They certainly can be - but their importance, so to speak, has already happened; those who care about these things have sorted themselves by party long ago. So mostly, as far as November is concerned, this new wrinkle just doesn't seem likely to have any effect at all."" But Carol Lee for the Wall Street Journal suggests that by clarifying his position on gay marriage, the president has offered a further contrast between himself and his Republican opponent. ""Mr Obama's position puts him squarely at odds with that of Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr Romney has said he believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, a stance he repeated this week. Mr Romney also opposes civil unions and has said he would back a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman."" And CNN's Dan Gilgoff says that the political consequences of President Obama's comments are far from clear yet. ""Obama stressed in the interview that his support was personal and that he would leave the issue of marriage to the states. But many conservatives chafed at the idea that the president's personal views would not affect public policy.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Yakub Memon: Support grows for Mumbai bomb plotter's plea,"Politicians, social activists, journalists and lawyers had urged President Pranab Mukherjee to commute the sentence. Mr Khan tweeted supporting Memon, but deleted the tweets later. Memon had filed a fresh plea after the Supreme Court last week dismissed a curative petition against his sentence. The Supreme Court will hear a fresh petition on Monday to stay the hanging which, Indian media reports say, is due for Thursday. On Saturday night, the actor took to Twitter to say Memon should not be hanged for his brother Tiger's sins. Tiger Memon is believed to have played an instrumental role in carrying out the attacks, which killed 257 people, and injured 713. Yakub Memon has been accused of providing financial and logistical support. ""Hang Tiger. Brother is being hanged for Tiger. Arre Where is Tiger? Get Tiger hang him. Parade him not his brother,"" Khan said, in the now deleted tweets. ""One innocent man killed is killing the humanity,"" he added. The actor also tweeted to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and asked him whether Tiger Memon was hiding in Pakistan. The tweets prompted instant outrage, with the state's governing BJP party even asking for the actor's bail in a hit-and-run case to be cancelled. The actor deleted the tweets after his father, Salim Khan, asked the public to ignore the ""ignorant"" and ""meaningless"" tweets. He later, however, tweeted this: But Salman Khan is not the only prominent personality asking for mercy for Memon. Several influential journalists, politicians and members of civil society have sent a letter to the president in this regard. ""We most humbly request your Excellency to consider the case of Yakub Abdul Razak Memon and spare him from the noose of the death for a crime that was master-minded by someone else to communally divide India,"" an excerpt from the letter reads. Senior politicians from different parties, including India's governing BJP, have signed the petition. Senior lawyers like Ram Jethmalani, KTS Tulsi and filmmaker Mahesh Bhat are also among the signatories. Senior journalist N Ram, who has signed the letter, also tweeted on Monday to support Memon's plea. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Wild parakeets take roost in Birmingham's Shard End,"David Gregory-KumarScience, Environment & Rural Affairs Correspondent Ring necked parakeets, our only naturalised parrot. In the South East large flocks of parakeets are now a common sight as escaped birds have formed breeding colonies. And now it seems they are spreading to the Midlands. I've managed to capture one or two on camera in the past and we've even carried out DNA analysis of dropped feathers. This revealed the birds in the Midlands are made up of parakeets moving up from the South East with the odd escaped pet. But then Kevin Whiston got in touch to tell us about a flock of parakeets he'd been watching in Shard End in Birmingham. Apparently over the last 12 months the population of 24 parakeets have almost doubled. If we could catch them on camera this would easily be the biggest parakeet flock in the Midlands we've ever seen. So we met Kevin in Shard End and went for a walk around the lake. Plenty of familiar British birdlife and then that loud squawking as two ring necked parakeets flew over our heads. After about half an hour the trees around the lake filled up with parrots. All noisily squawking and chattering, a brilliant green against the slate grey January skies. Eventually by around half past four around 40 or so birds had flown out to a small island in the centre of the lake to roost. It was a wonderful sight, easily exceeding my expectations. But Kevin told me while he watches the birds many people in the park walk right under them without even noticing them. They may technically be an invasive species but like all wild birds the parakeets are protected. And while there is some thought they might one day cause issues for native birds so far the RSPB doesn't think they are a problem. If anything they can be a brightly coloured introduction to the joys of bird watching and a cheerful addition to a garden bird feeder. Of course there may be bigger flocks out there, so if you know of an even bigger roost we'd really like to hear from you.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Elon Musk accused of stealing farting unicorn image,"Last year, Mr Musk tweeted the original image, which featured on a mug by Colorado potter Tom Edwards. However, similar images of farting unicorns were used in Tesla in-car interfaces and promotional material. Mr Edwards' daughter Lisa Prank said the art was ""ripped off"" by Mr Musk, who said he had offered to pay. On Thursday morning, Mr Musk tweeted a journalist saying: ""I offered to pay the guy who drew it twice already for something I don't even want."" In response to another tweet, he said: ""I definitely care about artists getting compensated. It would be unfair not to do so."" You might also like: In February 2017, Mr Musk shared the ""whimsical drawing"" of a unicorn farting electricity to power an electric car which featured on his ""favourite"" mug. The post brought some exposure for Mr Edwards, who had started making his unicorn mugs in 2010 and was thrilled to find out Mr Musk was a fan of his work. However, the happy relationship came to an end when Mr Edwards' friend bought a Tesla car and discovered the use of a similar farting unicorn. On Tuesday, Ms Prank tweeted to point out Mr Musk, the boyfriend of Canadian musician Grimes, ""ripped off my dad's art"", and asked: ""What do you have to say for yourself @elonmusk?""

""I'd really like to get on Elon Musk's good side,"" he said. ""He's really really interesting. But he isn't above copyright law."" Mr Edwards said he decided to speak out after he heard many stories about artists being ripped off. He talked to lawyers who told him his was a clear case of copyright violation.

Firefighters back industrial action in pensions row,"The move could trigger the first national firefighters' strike in more than a decade. FBU members in England, Scotland and Wales were balloted, with 78% of them voting in favour. Under government plans, firefighters in England will get their full pension at 60. Changes to pensions in Scotland and Wales have yet to be settled. The union says many firefighters will not be able to maintain fitness standards into their late 50s and this will endanger the public. Under the plans, those retiring early at, for example, 55 will lose thousands of pounds a year, the FBU argues. The government, however, says the existing arrangements are not affordable. Fire minister Brandon Lewis said: ""This government does not believe that industrial action is necessary. The pension on offer to firefighters is one of the most generous in the public sector. ""The FBU is creating a smokescreen around the issues of fitness and retirement age to justify their behaviour whilst ignoring the facts. ""After two years of discussions and improved terms, firefighters will still get one of the most generous public service pensions available - £26,000 a year, when including the £7,000 state pension. ""Someone in the private sector would have to contribute twice as much to get the same pension."" But FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: ""We cannot expect large numbers of firefighters in their late-50s to fight fires and rescue families without creating danger to the public and firefighters. ""We have repeatedly raised safety concerns and provided strong evidence to back it up but the government just isn't listening. ""This result is a clear indication of the anger felt by firefighters. It's still not too late for common sense to prevail if the government are willing to return to the negotiating table. ""None of us want a strike, but we cannot compromise on public and firefighter safety."" The union said no strike dates have been set yet but it is understood that any strike has to take place within 28 days of the ballot. The government has said all 46 fire and rescue authorities in England have robust contingency plans in place. The FBU said it wanted more talks with employers and government ministers to try to resolve the dispute. It also said it had received some proposals from the Scottish government which were being considered.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US firm RiverOak renews bid to reopen Manston Airport,"US investment firm RiverOak is applying for a Development Consent Order (DCO) on the basis that the airport is ""a project of national significance"". It is seeking a ""comprehensive DCO encompassing the compulsory purchase and the planning permissions required"". The site's owners have always maintained they will fight any attempt at compulsory purchase. In October, after legal advice, Thanet council rejected plans for it to buy out Manston Airport. Critics said the decision broke a key UKIP election pledge. Conservative MP Roger Gale described RiverOak's latest move as an ""alternative route... one I believe may deliver Manston back as a working airport"". He added: ""There is the real possibility of planes flying again by the early part of 2017."" What is a Development Consent Order? It is a fast means of getting permission for infrastructure developments of national significance These could include transport, water, waste or energy projects It was introduced in 2008 as a means of speeding up the planning process For Manston, it would mean bypassing the involvement of Thanet council in the planning process In a statement, RiverOak said: ""The reinstatement and development of Manston is a project of national significance as envisaged in the legislation and guidelines. ""It is therefore RiverOak's intention to apply for a comprehensive DCO encompassing the compulsory purchase of the airport and the planning permissions required."" The firm wants to turn Manston into a major international centre for air freight and a ""reliever"" for major London airports. 'Environmental disaster' New owners Chris Musgrave and Trevor Cartner have different plans for the site, which they have named Stone Hill Park. Their 20-year plan includes 2,500 homes, a sports village, 200 acres of manufacturing units with 4,000 jobs, and a film production studio. Under the proposals, a 200-acre park would be created with the former runway as a centrepiece. Local resident Simon Crow, who wants the development to go ahead, said: ""The centre of Ramsgate is right in line with the airport. ""RiverOak's proposal is for a freight hub with many, many more flights coming in and out with the possibility of night flights as well. ""I think it would be an environmental disaster for Ramsgate and surrounding areas.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour leadership ballot closes,"Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy or Sir Keir Starmer will be announced as the new leader on Saturday. The party's next deputy leader - replacing Tom Watson who resigned in December - will also be revealed. It is understood members will hear the result via email and the media after a special conference was cancelled over the coronavirus outbreak. Mrs Long-Bailey confirmed earlier this week that the candidates had been asked to record a victory speech “so it can be sent out over the airwaves as quickly as possible”. After the ballot closed, Sir Keir, who is widely considered to be the front-runner in the contest, posted a video on Twitter, saying: ""It's been a long campaign and it's ending in circumstances that none of us could have predicted. ""But we've kept it positive, we've demonstrated unity."" He added that all of the leadership candidates have ""demonstrated to our party, to our movement and hopefully to the country that real good can come out of this election"". Ms Nandy said in her video, also posted on Twitter after the ballot closed, that the contest had ended ""in the hardest of circumstances"". But during the campaign they ""showed Labour to be a party that has humility and self-confidence"" and ""honest when we get things wrong, but ambitious about our future"". She said Labour ""is a party that will win again"". Voting began on 24 February. Among those casting their votes were 114,000 new members who had joined since December's election, when Labour won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Members of affiliated trades unions and groups have also been voting, as well as about 14,700 ""registered supporters"" who paid £25 to take part on a one-off basis. The ballot used a preferential system, with members ranking the candidates in order of preference. If one fails to get more than half the first preference votes, the second preference votes of the lowest-ranked candidate are redistributed until the contest produces a winner. The system is the same for the deputy leadership race, where shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is regarded as the front-runner. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP Ian Murray, Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan and shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon are also in the running for the role.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Amazon readies Android app store,"It will initially offer programs that run on Google's Android mobile operating system. Developers can now submit their apps for approval and they should be available later this year. Amazon's move comes as the competition to become the go-to destination for mobile apps intensifies. App stores are supposed to provide software developers with a simple process for marketing their products, while simultaneously allowing consumers to easily find the ones they want. Following Apple's success with its iPhone there are now scores of online app stores. Game changer But Amazon believes its familiarity with online retailing will give its app store the edge. ""The sheer number of apps available today makes it hard for customers to find high-quality, relevant products - and developers similarly struggle to get their apps noticed,"" it said in a blog post. The Amazon store will provide developers with access to tens of millions of customers, who can make purchases easily using their existing accounts, it added. To success Amazon will have to balance Google's developer-friendly approach, which makes it easy for them to get their apps approved, with consumer services, said Thibaut Rouffineau, of the developer community the Wireless Industry Partner Connector. Some users have criticised Google's Android Market for its recommendation and search systems, he said. ""If you look at the features coming from Amazon they seem to be tackling quite a few of those."" While Amazon's Appstore is accepting submissions from developers now, the apps won't be available to buy until later this year - and then only for US residents initially. The success of Apple's original iPhone app store has attracted developers in their droves - and could ultimately herald a sea-change in how consumers buy software, said Mr Rouffineau. ""It has shaken the whole software industry and shown them [app stores are] the way to go,"" he added. Apple will be hoping that it can once again be at the vanguard of that change. Tomorrow it will open the App Store for its Mac OS platform. That store will allow people to download approved free and paid-for software straight to their laptops or desktops.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Clashes as Ethiopian Israelis protest over police shooting,"Thousands took to the streets of several cities on Tuesday, blocking roads with sit-ins and burning tyres. A police spokesman said 111 officers were wounded during the disturbances and that 136 people were arrested. The prime minister acknowledged the Ethiopian community faced ""problems"" but told protesters not to block roads. Tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews were brought to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s. They say they have faced systematic discrimination, racism and a lack of empathy for their hardships ever since. The killing of 18-year-old Solomon Tekah near Haifa on Sunday caused outrage among the Ethiopian community, with one member of the teenager's family accusing the off-duty police officer of murder. A police statement cited the officer as saying he had tried to intervene in a fight between two groups of youths. After he identified himself, the youths began throwing stones at him and he opened fire after ""feeling that his life was in danger"", the statement added. However, Israeli media cited witnesses as saying the officer was not attacked. The officer has been placed under house arrest and questioned by investigators. On Tuesday afternoon, protesters gathered at road junctions in cities including Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. ""We'll do whatever we can to make sure police will stop killing people because of their skin colour,"" one protester told AFP news agency. ""We don't know if this is going to happen again or not,"" he added. ""But we need confidence that the state or police give us guarantees it won't."" The police force said officers initially exercised restraint and allowed the protesters to block the roads, but that they had to intervene once the protesters started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones, burning tyres, and damaging property. Officers fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the protesters overnight. Emergency services said 50 people received medical treatment, including protesters, police officers and bystanders, according to the Haaretz newspaper. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he mourned ""the tragic death of young Solomon Tekah"", and that he embraced the teenager's family and the Ethiopian community. ""I know that there are problems that need to be solved. We have worked hard and need to work more to solve them,"" he added. ""But I ask of you one thing. Stop blocking the roads. We are a nation of law; we will not tolerate the blocking of roads. I ask you, let us solve the problems together while upholding the law."" President Reuven Rivlin called for an end to the violence and an investigation into Solomon Tekah's killing, saying: ""It is upon us to prevent the next death. The next humiliation. We are all obligated to this."" Protesters also blocked a highway in Tel Aviv in January, after a police officer shot and killed a mentally ill Ethiopian man who ran towards him brandishing a knife. Police said the Yehuda Biadga, 24, had ""posted a clear and present danger"", but his family said the officer had used excessive force.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Christmas ad spend 'to hit record high',"By Joshua CheethamBusiness Reporter The Advertising Association says it is being driven by intense market competition, especially within the retail sector, and the rise of big-budget campaigns. It believes spending on ads has jumped nearly 40% in just seven years. The figures come as campaigns by major retailers such as John Lewis, M&S and Asda get under way. ""There have been so many blockbuster campaigns over the last 10 years,"" says Karen Fraser, director of Credos, a think tank which compiled the forecast with the Advertising Association. John Lewis' Christmas ads have become particularly anticipated by the public and advertisers in recent years. A recurring theme in John Lewis adverts has been to take out branding and centre on stories to grab people's attention. Their latest campaign - launched this week - focuses on the tale of a little boy and his friendship with an imaginary monster living under his bed. Rival Marks and Spencer has launched an advert featuring Paddington Bear stumbling across a burglar he mistakes for Father Christmas. Meanwhile, Asda's ad follows a girl and her grandfather visiting a festive food factory. Upping the ante Among a survey of 1,000 Brits interviewed on behalf of the Advertising Association, nearly half said they had been moved to tears by Christmas ads they'd seen. One in six also said they have changed plans to watch the premiere of their favourite Christmas ad. ""It's just upped the ante,"" adds Karen Fraser, ""and so many brands and retailers are looking to compete in that market but it means that everyone needs to work harder to get people's attention."" Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that purchasing from retailers - traditionally the biggest investor in Christmas advertising - has increased. Prices of consumer goods have also undergone their highest year-on-year growth since March 2012 at 3.3%, meaning shops are facing an uphill struggle to attract consumers as real wages fall. ""A lot of businesses don't have much of an option other than to go for it,"" says Craig Mawdsley, chief strategy officer at advertising agency AMVBBDO. ""Some brands get to grow, but most are trying to offset the growth of others"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jenna Coleman 'leaving' Doctor Who,"It is thought the actress will make her last appearance as Clara Oswald before the Christmas special, which sees the return of Alex Kingston as River Song. Coleman joined Doctor Who in 2012, and has starred alongside two Doctors, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi. The Mirror reports that her next role will be as Queen Victoria in a major ITV drama series. The 29-year-old, who began her career in the soap opera Emmerdale, is expected to play the Queen from the age of 18 and in the early years of her reign. However, ITV said it was not making ""any announcements about casting presently"". The BBC has also declined to confirm Coleman's departure from Doctor Who. In an interview published in the Radio Times this week, the actress said she had always known her time on the show was finite. ""You're in Doctor Who knowing it will never last,"" she said. ""It's constantly regenerating, so you want to make your time count and enjoy the adventure for the fleeting time you're here."" 'Pleasure to work with' ITV announced in May they would be making an eight-part series about the life of Queen Victoria. It is being made by the producers of Poldark and has been created and written by the novelist Daisy Goodwin. Filming starts this month and it is understood that Coleman has already filmed her final scenes for Doctor Who, which returns to BBC One on Saturday. Rumours of the star's departure circulated last year, after a cliffhanger in the series eight finale, Death In Heaven. Fans had to wait until the end of the Christmas Day special to find out whether Coleman's character would return. Chief writer Steven Moffat later confirmed the actress had initially asked to be written out of the drama. ""That was her last episode,"" he said. ""Then she asked me if she could be in [the] Christmas [episode]. So I said, 'OK, I'll write you out in Christmas.'"" ""She came to the read through and did the 'write out' version - and again changed her mind."" ""But the truth is I never wanted her to go. And with Last Christmas, I'd already written the alternative version where she stayed, and I preferred that version. ""Frankly, I didn't want to lose her. She's an amazing actress, and she never stops working to make Clara better. I was very happy to go the extra mile to make sure we could keep her."" Capaldi, who plays the current incarnation of the Doctor, said he was ""thrilled"" Coleman had signed up for another series. While the actress said it was ""wonderful"" to stay, adding she ""couldn't walk away with the story being unresolved.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pringles tube tries to wake from 'recycling nightmare',"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The current container for the potato-based snack was condemned as a recycler’s nightmare. It's a complex construction with a metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid, and foil-lined cardboard sleeve. The Recycling Association dubbed it the number one recycling villain – along with the Lucozade Sports bottle. Now Pringles' maker Kellogg's is trialling a simpler can – although experts say it’s not a full solution. The existing version is particularly troublesome because it combines so many different materials Some 90% of the new can is paper. Around 10% is a polyal (plastic) barrier that seals the interior to protect the food against oxygen and moisture which would damage the taste. But how about the lid? Well, two options are on trial in some Tesco stores – a recyclable plastic lid and a recyclable paper lid. Kellogg's says these lids will still produce the distinctive ""pop"" associated with the product. Simon Ellin from the Recycling Association told BBC News: ""The Pringles tube has been a bastion of bad design from the recyclers' point of view. ""This new version is an improvement, and we broadly welcome it. ""But, frankly, if they are going to stick to a plastic lid that’ll just add to problems with plastic pollution - people on picnics leave them behind and they find their way into streams and the sea. That plastic lid has got to go."" Kellogg's says its packaging must be airtight, or the food inside will be wasted. The new designs have been 12 months in the making. Pringles have a shelf life of 15 months - and three million cans are made across Europe every day. Mr Ellin said the polyal-coated card might be recyclable but the product would need to be tested in recycling mills. And what of the much-criticised Lucozade Sports bottle? Mr Ellin said its unchanged basic design was still a big problem, as machines found it hard to differentiate the plastic in the bottle and the plastic that makes up its outer sleeve. He called on the makers, Suntory, to reduce the size of the external sleeve, as it has with the new Ribena bottle. The firm said it was planning to do this for the new year. Suntory said it was working on a new material made entirely from seaweed extract that was 100% edible, biodegradable and compostable. Environmentalists say that trivial changes like these won't solve the world's ecological crises - but on a large scale they'll make a contribution.

The case for a non-white Spider-Man,"By BBC Trending What's popular and why Here's how thousands of social media users have reacted to news of a deal between Sony Pictures and Walt Disney that means Spiderman may now be in an Avengers movie: they've begun a debate about Spidey's race. So far there have been two big-screen iterations of Spiderman swinging through New York, and in both of them Spidey's alter-ego has been the lily-white Peter Parker. But now, some comic books fans online now say it is time for a different webslinger to take over - specifically they want a teenager named Miles Morales. The Morales character has a Hispanic and black background, and has been featured in the comic book version since 2011. Morales took over when Peter Parker died in the Ultimate line of comics, and his looks were based on US President Barack Obama and actor Donald Glover. So will the new film incarnation of Spider-Man follow suit? Over the past 24 hours, around 5,000 people used Miles Morales' name on Twitter and a hashtag of his name seems to have been briefly trending. On Tuesday, #donaldforspiderman - a reference to the possiblity of Glover playing Morales in a movie version - also got a boost with more than 3,000 tweets. However, many more people online were discussing Peter Parker and the most recent Spidey actor, Andrew Garfield. ""I would be so excited to see #MilesMorales Spider-Man on the big screen!"" said one fan. ""MCU [Marvel Comic Universe] definitely has enough white guys."" Prominent heroes from minority backgrounds have been rare in the comics world. Many of the ones featured actually have the word ""black"" as part of their alter egos (Black Lighting and Black Panther, among others). And so when Morales came along, he was seen as a breakthrough by many - an A-list non-white character with critically acclaimed stories and a sizeable fan base. So will the new Spidey be black or white? Although Spider-Man will likely return as Peter Parker's alter ego - Sony mentioned him by name in their news release on Monday - Marvel was silent on the subject, giving Morales fans some hope. More generally, Hollywood is opening up when it comes casting its comic book characters. The dark-skinned, bald Samuel L. Jackson is now synonymous with Nick Fury even though the comic book character has been a white man with salt-and-pepper hair for decades. And this summer a new film version of The Fantastic Four will feature African-American actor Michael B. Jordan as the Human Torch - a role once held by the blond, blue eyed Chris Evans.

Personal travel agents boost holiday bookings,"By Simon GompertzPersonal finance correspondent, BBC News Helping sales is a growing army of 2,000 personal travel agents who work from home and visit clients whenever convenient. Worries about a Brexit effect on travel and the economy caused a lull over Christmas, but the vital New Year selling season is off to a rapid start. Bookings so far for May to October are up 5% versus the same period last year. Michelle Tolton, from the village of Rothley, near Leicester, sells holidays in clients' houses, over the phone and via Facebook. ""It's going well this year,"" she says, ""People are booking early. They want to escape the doom and gloom. ""I do all the legwork because they have busy lives."" Visiting a local customer, Kate Newman, the talk is about a holiday for 16 members of her family to one of this year's most popular destinations. ""We're still thinking of Turkey - you get more for your money,"" Kate explains. Michelle is well on her way to her target of a hundred bookings for the year. Many are to Europe, but she has also sold trips to see gorillas and luxury jaunts to Mauritius and Australia. The last two weeks have been a crucial period for the travel industry, after pre-Christmas speculation that people would be advised not to book trips for fear of a no-deal Brexit. But the New Year has been even busier than usual, according to the latest figures from the market specialists GfK Travel Insights. Non-EU destinations are up 19% compared with last year. That includes Turkey, but also Egypt and Tunisia. Fewer mini-breaks? The typical spend is higher as well, with the average selling price per person up slightly to £982. The travel agents group, ABTA, says its surveys show that 38% of holidaymakers plan to spend the same as last year and 27% intend to spend more. Alistair Rowland of Co-operative Travel believes some customers could be cutting back on mini-breaks and allocating more cash to their main holiday. And he believes they are not being distracted by concerns about the UK leaving the EU. ""I think if anything people are so tired of Brexit, and they are used to their pound buying less,"" he says. ""They are not willing to give up their main holiday of the year and they're willing to invest in it."" Travel shops are under pressure as more travellers buy over the internet. But industry insiders expect the new breed of Personal Travel Agents will lead the fightback. There could be a thousand more of them over the next few years, working from their kitchens and encouraging us to book early and book often. Even this year, though, there are still plenty of would-be holidaymakers who prefer to bide their time and hold out for a bargain later on.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: EU starts mass vaccination in 'touching moment of unity',"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been delivered to all 27 member states. Some countries started administering the jabs on Saturday, saying they were not prepared to wait another day. The EU has so far reported more than 335,000 Covid-related deaths. More than 14 million people have been infected, and strict lockdown measures are currently in place in nearly all the member states. The vaccine rollout comes as cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 are confirmed in several European nations as well as Canada and Japan. News of the new variant triggered travel restrictions around the world last week. What's the latest on the vaccine rollout? Mass vaccination across the EU - a bloc of 446 million people - began early on Sunday. This comes after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission authorised the German-US Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The EU has secured contracts for more than two billion vaccine doses from a range of drug companies. ""Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,"" Ms von der Leyen tweeted on Saturday. ""The #EUvaccinationdays are a touching moment of unity. Vaccination is the lasting way out of the pandemic,"" she added. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday: ""This really is a happy Christmas message. At this moment, lorries with the first vaccines are on the road all over Europe, all over Germany, in all federal states. Further deliveries will follow the day after tomorrow. ""This vaccine is the crucial key for defeating the pandemic. It's the key for us getting back our lives."" Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio urged his compatriots to get the jabs. ""We'll get our freedom back, we'll be able to embrace again,"" he said. Health workers in north-east Germany decided not to wait for Sunday and started immunising elderly residents of a nursing home in Halberstadt. In Hungary, the first recipient of the vaccine was a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital on Saturday, the state news agency says. The authorities in Slovakia also said they had begun vaccinating.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Everest avalanche: Sherpas discuss boycott,"The sherpas have threatened a boycott unless they get a bigger share of revenue from foreign climbers. On Tuesday the government raised the amount of compensation it is offering to the families of those who died. Friday's was the single deadliest accident in modern mountaineering on the world's highest peak. The avalanche struck in an area just above Everest base camp at 5,800m (19,000ft). Mark of respect The sherpas also want better measures to ensure speedy rescue and treatment facilities for guides. Three commercial guiding companies, among them one from the UK, have announced they are cancelling their expeditions to Everest. One of the guides who died was working for UK-based Jagged Globe and another five of its sherpa staff were injured in the avalanche, according to a company spokesman. Some sherpas want the boycott as a mark of respect for their dead colleagues. Correspondents say there is still hope a deal can be reached because so much money is at stake. Nepalese officials and mountaineering operators are being sent to base camp to take part in the negotiations on Thursday, the tourism ministry says. Crisis talks have also been taking place in Kathmandu between tourism officials, sherpa representatives and expedition leaders. Sherpas can earn up to $8,000 (£4,800) in the three-month Everest climbing season, more than 10 times the average wage in Nepal, which remains one of Asia's poorest nations. But BBC South Asia correspondent Andrew North says that does not look so good when the government is earning millions of dollars each year in fees for climbing permits and some guiding companies charging clients up to $60,000 (£36,000) per person, with more than 300 paying mountaineers this year. The guides who lost their lives on Friday had climbed up the slope early in the morning to fix ropes for climbers and prepare the route. The avalanche struck a passage called the Khumbu Icefall, which is riddled with crevasses and ice boulders that can break free without warning. Although relatively low on the mountain, it is one of its most dangerous points - but there are no safer paths along the famous South Col route first scaled by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Sherpas often make 20-25 round trips to carry kit and supplies to advanced camps, exposing them to greater risk. Everest has been scaled by more than 3,000 climbers since 1953. The rising number of tourists has raised concerns about safety and environmental damage, although Nepal still plans to cut fees from next year for those wishing to make the climb. Some 250 climbers have died on the mountain, which is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet, and can be climbed from both sides.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ed Balls: Labour would back mansion tax to fund tax credits,"The shadow chancellor toldBBC political editor Nick Robinsonthat the details had to be right so people were ""not thrown out of their homes"". ""If the chancellor wants to go down that road then we will support him... let's work together,"" Mr Balls said. But he said any money raised should be spent on reversing cuts to tax credits and not cutting the top rate of tax. The Lib Dems have previously floated the idea of a ""mansion tax"" on property or land assets over a certain value. Business Secretary Vince Cable said earlier on Thursday that he was ""pretty confident"" there would be a shift in tax from income to wealth. He added, however, that this might not take the form of a mansion tax. 'Out of touch' But Mr Balls said he could back the idea, asking: ""The issue is what's the purpose? If the purpose is to help families facing higher tuition fees, higher VAT or higher fuel bills - for example boosting their tax credits - yes. ""But if the priority is, as (Chancellor) George Osborne seems to be saying, that he will only use the mansion tax to help people on incomes above £150,000, I say that is out of touch with the struggle families are facing and won't help get people into jobs."" The shadow chancellor said he no longer believed that the 50p tax rate should start at a lower income - £100,000 a year and not £150,000 - as he argued in the Labour leadership election. Earlier on Thursday Business Secretary Vince Cable, a Lib Dem, said he was ""pretty confident"" there would be a shift in tax from income to wealth. On BBC One's Question Time, Conservative Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said: ""This is a matter for the chancellor and I'm sure he will come to a sensible solution."" On Mr Cable, he added: ""He's indeed a soothsayer of some importance, but I'm just a functionary who would make things happen, but it would be very difficult to do so... It's a coalition and all views are welcome."" The Budget takes place on 21 March and Mr Osborne has asked HM Revenue and Customs to see how much the tax is raising - or whether avoidance measures mean it is not bringing in extra money.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boardrooms 'need more ethnic diversity',"More than half of firms in the FTSE 100 do not have any directors from an ethnic minority on their board, the government-commissioned research shows. It argues that every FTSE 100 company should have at least one non-white director by 2021. This would better reflect the current UK workforce, the report says, and make companies more competitive. Of the 1,087 director positions at firms in the FTSE 100 index, 8% are held by non-white directors, even though 14% of the UK is from a non-white ethnic group. Just seven companies account for more than one-third of the directors with an ethnic background. Most of those have links to South Africa - they are the mining firms Fresnillo, Antofagasta, Randgold Resources, the insurer Old Mutual, and the brewer SAB Miller. The other two are the Anglo-Dutch household goods supplier Unilever and the Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered. 'Not just tokenism' Sir John Parker, who led the review, said: ""The boardrooms of Britain's leading companies do not reflect the ethnic diversity of either the UK or the stakeholders that they seek to engage and represent."" He added: ""Ethnic minority representation in the boardrooms across the FTSE 100 and 250 is disproportionately low. ""This is not an exercise of tokenism; the recommendations are underpinned by strong industrial logic and the need for UK companies to be competitive in the increasingly challenging global marketplace."" The recommendations include requiring human resources teams in FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies to identify ethnically diverse people to be considered for board jobs when vacancies come in, as well as developing mentoring programmes. It also recommends that companies set out their efforts in their annual reports, and where necessary detail why targets have not been met. Accountancy firm EY, which supported the report, has been running a diversity programme for the past five years, and has more than doubled the number of black and ethnic minority partners in their business to 8%. Sanjay Bhandari from EY says the broader talent pool gives the firm a more competitive edge. ""We are making strides, but there is still more to do,"" he says. The report is now open to consultation, with the final findings and recommendations due in 2017.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Will other cities want a minister like Portsmouth's?,"By Andrew GloverBBC News Conservative Michael Fallon will take on on the role while the area recovers from the decision by BAE Systems to close a shipyard, resulting in the loss of 900 jobs. Alexandra Jones, chief executive of the thinktank Centre for Cities, said the ministerial appointment was an ""attempt to demonstrate the focus"" the government had on the shipyard jobs. She said the move was ""pretty rare"" - the last city to have its own ministerial champion was Liverpool, when Michael Heseltine was handed the job at the height of Merseyside's battles with the Thatcher government in 1981. 'Reconsider the case' Ms Jones said there may well now be a ""chorus"" of appeals from around the country for more influence. ""I'd imagine many places will say 'Portsmouth's got a minister, we could use one too',"" she said. Under the last Labour government, ministers were appointed for each region, but the roles were scrapped by the coalition. Newcastle East MP Nick Brown was minister for the North East and has called for the position to be reinstated to support efforts to tackle issues such as youth unemployment. Mr Brown said appointing a minister was ""the right thing for Portsmouth given its situation"" but also ""the right thing to do for the North East"". ""I welcome the government's announcement,"" he said. ""The government should reconsider the case for doing the same thing for the North East."" In October, David Cameron told Mr Brown the government was committed to ""decentralisation of power"" from government and pointed to initiatives including the Regional Growth Fund, which aims to help businesses create jobs around the country. Other efforts to allow the regions to go their own way are the responsibility of cities minister Greg Clarke. Councils in Greater Manchester came together to form the country's first combined authority, giving the area more control over decisions on planning, regeneration and transport spending. But similar plans in the North East appear to have reached an impasse. At the same time as expecting a series of special case pleading from some cities, Ms Jones said other areas of the country are confident in mapping their own success. ""More and more cities are confident about who they are and where they're going,"" she said. ""I'd imagine Portsmouth will be a big exception in terms of getting a minister.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
No SNP applause on Cameron's legacy at final PMQs,"Speaking at Mr Cameron's final Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Robertson said he could not applaud such a record. The prime minister said his successor Theresa May was a ""brilliant negotiator"" who would secure a good deal for the UK and for Scotland. David Cameron is due to be replaced as prime minister by Mrs May. Mr Robertson did however wish Mr Cameron and his family well ""notwithstanding our differences"". During a raucous PMQs in which Mr Cameron was loudly praised by his own MPs, the SNP's Westminster leader said: ""The prime minister's legacy will undoubtedly be that he has taken us to the brink of being taken out of the European Union, so we will not be applauding his premiership on these benches. ""What advice has he given his successor on taking Scotland out of the EU against the wishes of Scottish voters?"" The prime minister responded that the UK should ""should try to be as close to the European Union as we can be, for the benefits of trade, of co-operation and of security"". He added: ""The channel will not get any wider once we leave the European Union and that is the relationship we should seek. That will be good for the United Kingdom and for Scotland."" Angus Robertson also used Mr Cameron's final appearance at the dispatch box to attack Mrs May and draw further attention to the Brain family, who are facing deportation from the UK after coming to the Highlands from Australia in 2011. He told the House of Commons: ""The prime minister's successor is very, very well known in Scotland...because of the threat to deport the very much liked and loved Brain family from the Highlands."" Mr Robertson said one of Mrs May's first tasks would be to impose Trident ""against the will of almost every single MP from Scotland"". The prime minister said he was hopeful that the Brain family would secure a work visa to remain in Scotland. Mr Cameron said: ""We've given them an extension to the 1 August to put in an application for a work visa in the normal way, and I very much hope that will happen. ""On Trident, there will be a vote in this house and it's right that this house should decide and many people in Scotland support our nuclear deterrent, maintaining it and the jobs that come to Scotland. ""He asks about the record of this government when it comes to Scotland, well I'll tell him what it is - 143,000 more people in work in Scotland, massive investment in the renewable industries in Scotland, the two biggest war ships ever built in our history built in Scotland, a powerhouse parliament, a referendum that was legal, decisive and fair and, I might add, a Scotsman winning Wimbledon twice while I was prime minister.

New trains urged for electrified Swansea to London line,"Party leader Leanne Wood is urging the Welsh government to lobby ministers in Westminster, who are leading the project, for new rolling stock. The £350m investment will also see lines from Cardiff to the south Wales valleys electrified. The Welsh government said it would try to ensure the best deal for Wales. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the Welsh government would consider what rolling stock was required for the Valley lines. The south Wales rail electrification, and the prospect of longer, faster trains, was announced by the DfT in July 2012. Network Rail has said modernising one of the busiest lines into south Wales will cut 20 minutes off the three-hour journey between Swansea and London. Passengers are expected to benefit from the new services by 2018. But Ms Wood, the AM for South Wales Central, said Welsh rail passengers should not have to travel in rolling stock cast-offs from other parts of the UK network. ""I welcome electrification but I want to ensure that the valleys network does not receive a second class service when it is introduced sometime between 2018 and the end of 2019. ""Passengers in the Rhondda, where I live, already feel as though they get the rough end of rail services. ""Pacer trains, which are effectively buses on tracks, are not the most comfortable ride, they are around 35 years old and have no modern facilities on trains people see in other countries. There are also major capacity issues."" 'Major test' She said in the past old trains from Scotland and northern England had been brought in to serve the valleys. ""The decision will lie with the UK government but I would expect the Welsh government to make it absolutely clear that we should have new trains. This is a major test for them in terms of standing up for Wales,"" Ms Wood added. The Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We will do everything we can to ensure the best deal for Wales."" A DfT spokesman the UK government was committed to transforming the rail network in Wales, including a major programme of electrification for the Great Western main line and Valley lines, and the introduction of new state-of-the-art trains as part of the government's £4.9bn intercity express programme. ""We will continue to work closely with the Welsh government as it considers what rolling stock is required for these local Valley Lines services,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sussex university students bid to save Dissertation Dash,"The Dissertation Dash - where students race to hand in their final work before the deadline - is under threat after changes in procedures. The 13 May deadline now falls during exam time and there is no longer a single location to submit work. The Students' Union said the dash was unique and a highlight of student life. It has begun talks with university officials who have offered to help establish a new event. Naked run Union communications officer Kit Bradshaw is keen for one final hurrah before the university switches over to electronic dissertation submissions, probably next year. The dash began during the 1990s, as arts and some social-science students at the Brighton university discovered a fun way of marking the final hurdle to their degree. After printing off their tomes in the library, they would dash the few hundred yards to the handing-in point in Falmer House - often in fancy dress, or even naked, according to some reports - cheered on by hundreds of fellow students. Mr Bradshaw said: ""It has been an institution for 15 or 20 years and has really built up in the last five years. ""Since we launched our campaign [to save it] we've had former students saying it was the highlight of their experience here - the thing they looked forward to, to get through those last 24 hours."" Electronic submissions A university spokeswoman said: ""Sussex sets strict deadlines for the handing in of work, and the dash was our students' tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of that need to meet deadlines."" She said dissertations no longer needed to be handed in centrally, but would be taken to the relevant school offices around the campus. She added: ""In due course, all work will be submitted electronically so, as the university moves with the times, so must the Dissertation Dash."" She said university officials were discussing with students a new event involving all departments and would be happy to try to keep a day free of exams. Mr Bradshaw said: ""This was never a planned event. It came about spontaneously."" He added, if exams could be rescheduled, the university ""should reverse their decision and retain it until electronic submission is brought in"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump 'looks forward' to meeting Theresa May,"The US President-elect tweeted that the Prime Minister would head to Washington to meet him after his inauguration. He referred to Britain as ""a long time US ally"" and as ""very special"". Mrs May said Britain ""shares values"" with the US but denounced Mr Trump's previous obscene comments about women as ""unacceptable"". In reference to footage of Mr Trump bragging about grabbing women, released before his election, Mrs May said: ""I think that's unacceptable, but in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and has apologised for it."" She told Sky News on Sunday that UK-US relations were ""much bigger"" than an individual friendship between the British and American premiers. ""It's an important relationship in terms of security and stability around the world,"" she said. Mrs May, who said she has had two ""positive conversations"" with Mr Trump ahead of the meeting, added: ""We feel we can say to the US if we disagree with something they're doing."" The meeting was organised by the PM's closest advisers over Christmas. A date has not yet been confirmed, but is expected to come within weeks of Mr Trump's inauguration on 20 January. Mr Trump's tweet was sent just after 02:00 GMT (21:00 in New York). The PM and President-elect have spoken twice since his election victory in November and Mrs May's joint chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, travelled to the US in December to meet with Mr Trump's team. Special relationship? The first British politician to meet Mr Trump after his win was former Ukip leader Nigel Farage - five days after the US went to the polls. Mr Farage, who campaigned alongside the incoming president, said the new leadership offered a ""real opportunity"" for improved trade between the UK and the US. Mrs May received a phone call from Mr Trump two days after the election and is thought to have been the ninth leader he spoke to. In a tweet a week later, Mr Trump said Mr Farage would ""do a great job"" if the government made him the ambassador to the US. Mr Farage said the suggestion had come as a ""bolt from the blue"", adding: ""If I could help the UK in any way I would"". But Downing Street rejected the idea, saying ""there is no vacancy"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Brexit: PSNI 'won't police customs checkpoints', says chief constable","By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Mr Byrne had a 30 minute video call with the prime minister last Friday. He also told Mr Johnson he had ""no plans to put police officers on any one of 300 crossings"" along the border. Speaking after a meeting of the policing board in Belfast, Mr Byrne said the PSNI does not want ""to be dragged into another type of policing"". Speaking on BBC NI's The View later on Thursday, Mr Byrne said: ""At the moment we have no plans to put our police officers in that sort of space [border crossings]. He added: ""Obviously, as people would expect, we have a duty to protect people's lives, so if we have intelligence about threats to people from other agencies such as customs or the border force working in a particular place where they are vulnerable to attack, we will send officers to protect them. ""But I think it's on a case by case and intelligence-led basis."" The prime minister submitted his Brexit offer to the EU on Wednesday. It would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks. The PM's Brexit plan also set out details of a replacement for the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The chief constable has taken legal advice on what he can be asked to do. Negotiations Mr Byrne added he did not want ""to interfere in negotiations"" involving Mr Johnson and the European Union (EU). Last year, the PSNI was given money to hire 180 extra officers to help prepare for Brexit. It now wants government funding for 300 more officers next year, as part of a push towards eventually achieving a police service comprised of 7,500. Officer numbers are currently around 6,800. The policing board is fully supportive of the PSNI's request for increased staffing. On Thursday night, Mr Byrne was also asked on The View about Catholic recruitment to the PSNI. He said he would like to see those numbers increase, along with the numbers of women, working class loyalists and minorities. ""I would be concerned if the number of Catholic officers degraded from the current levels and I can't ignore the risk that that might happen,"" he said. ""But if we're to be truly representative, in its broader sense, we need to look at positive action for other parts of the community.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Anuj Bidve murder trial: Kiaran Stapleton 'calculating',"Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, said Kiaran Stapleton, 21, wanted the jury at Manchester Crown Court to believe he simply ""lost control"" at times. Upon asking Mr Stapleton why he picked to target Mr Bidve in a group of people, he replied: ""I can't tell you"". Mr Stapleton has admitted shooting the Lancaster University student on 26 December 2011, but denies murder. Mr Bidve was shot in Ordsall Lane while he was walking with friends through Salford at about 01:30 BST on the way to the sales in Manchester city centre. The prosecution pointed to three previous incidents involving Mr Stapleton, which Mr Cummings said proved he only attacked when the odds were in his favour. With this in mind, Mr Cummings told the court Mr Bidve presented the ""perfect"" victim for Mr Stapleton, of Regent Square, Ordsall. 'Simple reason' The prosecution said it was ""obvious"" Mr Bidve, 23, and the eight other Indian students who were with him were not local. ""You were cocky when you marched over with this gun"", Mr Cummings said. ""No"", Mr Stapleton replied. ""Did they not look to you like foreign students or foreign business people, smart, clean-cut, respectable?"" ""No, just normal people"", said Mr Stapleton. Mr Cummings said after asking the group for the time, Mr Stapleton ""almost immediately"" shot Mr Bidve in the head. The prosecutor said there was a ""simple reason"" Mr Bidve was the victim, as he was the last person in the group. ""It's not the way you operate, you attack from behind,"" Mr Cummings said. ""Thanks you for pointing that out. I will bear it in mind,"" Mr Stapleton replied. 'On your patch' Mr Cummings said Mr Stapleton's ""problem"" was he was not brave enough to take people on, on equal terms. He told the court: ""This was perfect, absolutely perfect. You wanted to kill someone and nothing could be better than a group of foreigners on your patch. ""You shot that man and killed him, it worked like a treat and you ran off laughing?"" ""That was not correct,"" Mr Stapleton replied. The prosecution suggested the defendant was ""quite happy"" with word getting around the estate that he was responsible for the shooting, as long as the police did not have any evidence. ""Why would that make me happy?"" Mr Stapleton asked. ""So you would get your reputation as a hard man"", Mr Cummings replied. ""You were celebrating what you had done, having a laugh with your mates about it, enjoying their admiration as the hard man of the estate, this was what it was all about, wasn't it?"" ""No,"" replied the defendant. Mr Stapleton has admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility at a previous hearing, but his plea was not accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service. The trial was adjourned until Monday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sisi gives Egypt military new powers after Sinai attack,"A spokesman said the new law gives the army the right to secure sites like power plants, main roads and bridges. But critics say it allows the army to return to the streets and bring back military trials for civilians. President Sisi declared a three-month state of emergency after the bomb attack in Sinai on Friday. The new decree allows state infrastructure to be defined as ""military facilities"" for two years, permitting the army to work with police to secure such sites. It also gives the military the right to try people it suspects of launching attacks on those sites. Activists say the law is too broadly defined and could also cover universities, where police have been unable to stop student protests. Putting an end to military trials was one of the main aims of the 2011 uprising that ousted the former president, Hosni Mubarak. Presidential spokesman Alaa Youssef insisted the decree was aimed at tackling terrorism, not protesters, and told the BBC it was a limited, proportional response to recent attacks by militants. The law was introduced after President Sisi promised a tough response to what he called an ""existential threat"" to Egypt posed by Islamist militants. In light of the perceived threat, the editors of 17 newspapers in Egypt have decided to refrain from publishing criticism of the army or the state, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo reports. Human rights groups say it is another sign that the room for dissent in Egypt is shrinking even further, our correspondent adds. Activists arrested Meanwhile, an Egyptian judge ordered 21 activists to be arrested on Monday at the start of their retrial for breaking protest laws during the military's overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. The activists, who had been released on bail last month, chanted ""down with military rule"" after the judge read out his decision in court. The court also issued arrest warrants for four of the defendants who did not show up. The group, which includes leading campaigner Alaa Abdel Fattah, were sentenced to 15 years in prison in absentia last June for violating a 2013 law curbing the right to public protests. They were later arrested and tried again in person on the same charges but that trial collapsed last month when the presiding judge stepped down. On Sunday, Mr Abdel Fattah's younger sister Sanaa, a 20-year-old student, was jailed for three years along with 23 other young activists for breaking protest laws. Outside the courtroom on Monday, Mr Abdel Fattah said the rulings against activists like his sister were a deliberate attempt by the government to imprison and silence their critics. The judge set the next hearing for Mr Abdel Fattah and the 20 other activists for 11 November.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Libya assets tax 'should go to IRA Semtex victims',"By Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI Political Correspondent It has emerged that £17m in tax has been collected over the past three years on some of the assets seized. The figure - about £5m every year - was released by the government. It followed questions from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster. The new chair of the committee, Conservative MP Simon Hoare, said the government needs to ask itself whether ""it is content to continue profiting from frozen Libyan assets while victims receive nothing"". The MP added ""there is now a clear moral imperative for this money to be used to help victims who have suffered for far too long"". ""The tried and tested methods of grappling with this issue of the last 15 years has amounted to nothing for victims, so we are calling for a fresh approach, imagination and compassion from the government to ensure victims are compensated urgently,"" he said. Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi supplied weapons, including Semtex explosives, to the IRA during the Troubles. In previous reports, the NI Affairs Committee argued that the government should use any taxes collected on the frozen assets to set up a fund for IRA victims of Libyan-supplied Semtex. Libya compensated US victims of terrorism, but UK victims were left out of the deal. 'Untenable policy position' The government insists it is not its responsibility to secure compensation for victims of Libyan Semtex, and that victims should pursue cases with the Libyan authorities individually. The NI Affairs Committee has said this is ""an untenable policy position"". The government has appointed a special advisor to calculate how much compensation should be sought from the Libyan government. But it has rejected calls from the NI Affairs Committee for that special advisor to lobby the Libyan government on behalf of IRA victims. In its response to the NI Affairs committee, the government said it wants to see ""a just settlement for all victims of Qadhafi sponsored IRA terrorism"" and is confident ""the appointment of a special representative will bring greater focus to our efforts"". However, it added: ""Securing compensation for victims of attacks indirectly enabled by the Libyan government is inevitably more complex.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sean Gallagher questioned over alleged Fianna Fail cheque during presidential debate,"The claim was made by the Sinn Fein candidate Martin McGuinness. Mr Gallagher initially claimed he had no recollection of receiving a cheque for 5,000 euros from an individual in Dundalk, County Louth, two years ago. Mr Gallagher later conceded an envelope may have been handed over. He said the cheque would have been delivered to Fianna Fail headquarters. Mr McGuinness raised the issue of the cheque which is thought to have related to a Fianna Fail fundraiser. He told RTE's Frontline programme: ""This gentleman told me there was between 30 and 35 people in the room. He also told me that after the event that Sean called around to his house and took a cheque for 5,000 euros,"" he said. Political donation In response Mr Gallagher said: ""What Martin has said is that I drove to the man's house to deliver a photograph of the event and that he gave me a cheque. ""I may well have delivered the photograph, if he gave me an envelope (laughter and jeers from audience). ""The point is, if he gave me the cheque it was made out to Fianna Fail headquarters. (audience heckling). If he gave me the cheque it was made out to Fianna Fail headquarters and it was delivered and that was that."" Mr Gallagher was also questioned about the circumstances of an irregular company loan. ""By the time that the accountant in doing reconcilliation of the account noticed it, they allocated that as a loan,"" he said. ""I didn't take the money out of the account. The money was in a different account."" Mr McGuinness came under pressure when he was asked by presenter Pat Kenny if those killed in the Troubles could be described as murder victims or collateral damage.

'Failing leadership' at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust,"Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has been in special measures since November 2018. Since then further concerns have come to light. The latest inspections show more services have been downgraded and ""further serious concerns"" identified. SaTH said it was taking ""immediate action"" to improve performance and delivery of care. Following Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections on 9 and 10 June, focusing on the hospital trust's general medical care and end-of-life care, both the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal have been rated inadequate on every measure. Criticism included the competency of staff in some roles, national guidance not being followed for some procedures and the lack of accuracy in patient records. It included both issues ""previously identified"" which had not been addressed and ""new areas for concern"". ""The trust's issues have been perpetuated by its leaders' collective failure to demonstrate that they had the skills and abilities to meet the challenges the trust has faced,"" inspectors said. CQC Chief Inspector of Hospitals Ted Baker wrote to NHS England's chief operating officer last month about his latest concerns. The letter, seen by the BBC, said the trust was ""normalising poor care"" across departments, not just in maternity and emergency care, which have attracted the most criticism in recent years. Since it was put into special measures, the trust has become subject to a criminal investigation into baby deaths, while an independent inquiry into the same issue has been widened and is now reviewing more than 1,800 cases. ""We have repeatedly called for intervention to support improvement at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust,"" Mr Baker said. He therefore welcomed a partnership with University Hospitals Birmingham, announced last week, which is designed to provide ""leadership expertise"". He described it as an important ""first step towards implementing the urgent changes that are required"". The hospital trust Chief Executive Louise Barnett, who started in February, said: ""I am determined we take immediate action to ensure a significant improvement in performance and delivery of care at SaTH."" She said the partnership with UHB would help deliver ""a rapid improvement plan"" that would ""support clinically safe and sustainable patient services"".

Five things we learned from Archie's birth certificate,"By Katharina SchoffmannBBC News Now snippets of information about the day have been revealed in his birth certificate. Here are five things we learned from it. 1. Archie was not born at home Despite earlier speculation that Meghan had given birth at the couple's home in Windsor, we now know for definite that the birth happened at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster, where the cost of a basic birth begins at £6,100. Meghan isn't the only royal who has given birth at Britain's only fully private maternity hospital. Sarah, Duchess of York, gave birth to Prince Harry's cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie at the hospital in Great Portland Street, central London. 2. The Duchess of Sussex is listed as Princess of the United Kingdom... ... as in that's her occupation. You might know Meghan as the Duchess of Sussex, but following her May 2018 marriage she did also technically become a princess. Meghan is not the first royal to list her occupation as princess - Catherine did the same on her children's birth certificates. 3. Prince Harry took a total of 11 days to register Archie's birth Which is ""pretty normal"", according to Alicja Gilroy, who works as a superintendent registrar, although in Oxford, so is not likely to register a royal birth herself. She adds that, from her own experiences, most people manage to register their baby's birth within the official 42-day deadline. However, not everyone is as organised. Sometimes people register their children's births just ""at the edge"" of the 42 days because they can't agree on a name, she adds. 4. Harry signed the birth certificate The prince registered the birth of his son but Meghan may well have been present as well. When a couple is married, only one parent is required on the register. Ms Gilroy says that sometimes, when dads come on their own, ""they're more likely to make mistakes, perhaps because they're not aware of all the information required"". She added that they don't always know when they got married and ""don't want to ring their wives up admitting it"". There appear to be no such issues for Prince Harry. But sadly we don't get to see how the new (possibly sleep-deprived) dad forms the ""H"" in his signature. The copy of the birth certificate issued for public consumption is a typed-up version of the original.

No special treatment for Archie and his dad Despite being royal, the birth certificate wasn't signed by one of the most senior employees at Westminster Register Office.

Britain's Got Talent: Ronan Parke 'stardom' claim denied,"Ronan Parke, 12, of Poringland, near Norwich, is odds-on favourite to win Britain's Got Talent on Saturday. An anonymous blogger - who claims to be a Sony music executive - has said that Mr Cowell's firm Syco had been working with Ronan for two years. Syco, Sony and Ronan Parke's mother Maggie completely deny the allegation. Mrs Parke said: ""It's laughable, to be perfectly honest with you, and it couldn't be further from the truth. ""There's just no foundation in it whatsoever. My friend Susan Gunn told me that she'd seen it on the internet and we just had a laugh about it and didn't think any more about it because it's so untrue."" She said Ronan had applied to the show without his parents' knowledge. 'Nature of life' ""It was just something he really wanted to do. He felt it was the right time for him to apply and the first we heard about it was when we got a phone call from Britain's Got Talent saying he had an audition,"" she said. Ronan is one of six acts to have already made it through to the ITV1 final, with further acts to be chosen in semi-finals on Thursday and Friday nights. He won the viewers' vote on Monday, putting him straight through to the Saturday show. Asked whether the claims would distract her son, Mrs Parke said: ""As far as I'm concerned you're always going to get people that are saying nasty things because that's the nature of life, unfortunately. ""It won't affect Ronan. Ronan's focussed on what he's doing. He knows the truth, we know the truth and certainly Simon Cowell and everybody at Syco knows the truth."" She also denied the blogger's claims that Ronan had received coaching to lose a Norfolk accent. ""He's not got a Norfolk accent, but neither has my other son. He's certainly never had coaching. The only coaching he's had is singing lessons,"" she said. Syco said in a statement: ""Ronan first came to Syco/Sony's attention when he entered this year's competition. ""Syco/Sony Music will not hesitate to take whatever legal action is appropriate to prevent further publication of these unfounded allegations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US report accuses China of 'digital authoritarianism',"It warns that China's mounting influence on the digital sphere could soon overshadow that of the US and other democracies. And it expresses concern about its export of surveillance technology. The US has put pressure on other countries to ban Huawei from their mobile networks. And it is also considering a wider ban on other Chinese tech firms such as TikTok. Relationships between the US and China are tense, not just over the role of Chinese tech firms but over the coronavirus pandemic and more general trade between the two nations. Sweeping new security rules in Hong Kong and evidence suggesting ill-treatment of the Uighur population have added to general concerns about China's role in global politics. The report, commissioned by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, warns that China could rewrite the rules of the internet unless the US and its allies push back. ""The United States is now on a precipice of losing the future of the cyber domain to China,"" the report reads. ""If China continues to perfect the tools of digital authoritarianism and is able to effectively implement them both domestically and abroad, then China, not the United States and its allies, will shape the digital environment."" It warns that Beijing has already heavily invested in digital surveillance technology which it has exported to countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Uzbekistan. Meanwhile many of the world's biggest tech platforms - Google, Twitter and Facebook - are banned inside China. The report recommends that the US government: Leslie Vinjamuri, an expert with Chatham House think-tank, said it was a ""significant"" report that suggested the Democrats would be tough on China if the party took power after the 2020 election. ""This is a signal of where the Democrats are going and suggests a forceful set of policies that will put more pressure on Europe to follow the US on this,"" she said. ""This has been a long time coming and is basically a call to arms for the US to protect not just itself and its technology companies, but to lead a campaign for all democracies. If they can get a co-ordinated strategy, that is a graver threat to China."" Offering alternatives to firms such as Huawei was an ""intelligent play if you want to keep China out"", she added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
AI finds novel way to beat classic Q*bert Atari video game,"The AI program used trial and error to uncover a quirk in the game's code that let it score a huge amount of points. No human player of Q*bert is believed to have ever uncovered the tricks it used to win. The AI program was let loose on the video game by German researchers who are developing code that can learn. Suicide strategy Video games have proved popular with AI researchers because they are limited worlds in which success (high scores) and failure (losing the game) are easy to assess. This can help refine AI programs because those that score the most points and lose the least are likely to be better learners. Patryk Chrabaszcz, Ilya Loshchilov and Frank Hutter from the University of Freiburg let several basic AI programs loose on classic Atari video games as part of work on what are known as ""evolutionary algorithms"". As the name implies this involves generating lots of algorithms, seeing which ones perform best and then mutating or changing them in small ways to see if they get better or worse. These evolutionary methods stand in contrast to another widely used approach known as ""deep reinforcement learning"" that mimic biological neural networks and allow them to learn for themselves. The best known of these systems is Google's Deep Mind. Different strategies In Q*bert, players are presented with a pyramid made of cubes on which they must jump around. Landing on the top of a cube changes its colour. The player must change all the cubes' colours without being caught by the game's enemies. Rather than the original, the researchers used an updated version of the game, and seven others, to make it easier for their AI creation to try out different strategies. On Q*bert, said the researchers, the AI code found two ""particularly interesting solutions"". One revolved around an in-game bug which saw the AI-controlled player jump from cube to cube seemingly at random. However, they found, this caused the cubes to start blinking and rewarded the player with a huge amount of points. A video posted by Mr Chrabaszcz shows the AI-controlled player getting lots of points in only 10 minutes. Warren Davis, who worked on the original arcade version of Q*bert, said he was not familiar with the ported code but added; ""This certainly doesn't look right, but I don't think you'd see the same behaviour in the arcade version."" Another novel strategy involved endlessly tempting Q*bert to commit suicide. Each time this happened the program received enough points for another life so it could repeat the cycle. In their research paper, the team said the success shown by their ""basic"" algorithm showed the promise of this branch of AI and could be ""considered as a potentially competitive approach to modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rowan Williams begins University of South Wales role,"The University of South Wales' position is the first major public role in Wales for Rowan Williams since he retired in 2012. In his role as chancellor, he presented honorary doctorates to Carwyn Jones and Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland. The University of South Wales was formed by the merger of Glamorgan and Newport universities last June. ""I'm delighted to be involved in a major institution in a part of the world that's so important to me,"" said Lord Williams of Oystermouth, who grew up in the Swansea Valley and is also a former Archbishop of Wales."" 'Burden' Lord Williams, who took up another academic role as master of Magdalene College in Cambridge after relinquishing the church role, was asked his views on student tuition fees and debt which he described as ""pretty stressful"" for students. ""The debt burden is a real one and we're beginning to see how impractical it is to think you'll get all that money back in the long term,"" he said. ""I think there're some really serious questions about how much we want as a society to invest in higher education. I hope it will be more. ""Like most people of my generation - first of their family to go to university - I look back and ask would it have been possible for me to go to university if I had that burden - and I think it wouldn't have been."" As well as the first minister and Wales rugby coach, Lord Williams also presented honorary doctorates to presiding judge for Wales, the Honourable Mrs Justice Nicola Davies, and to Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. University of South Wales vice-chancellor, Prof Julie Lydon, said: ""The installation of chancellor is, of course, a moment of great academic ceremony, but it is also fundamental reassertion of our values. ""As part of this celebration, it is important that we are able to honour the work of some outstanding individuals, and we are privileged to make this award to Julia Unwin for her work in influencing public policy and campaigning for charity."" Students at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama performed a fanfare composed for the ceremony.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Florida Zika cases prompt UK advice for pregnant travellers,"Its travel advice was updated after Florida confirmed four cases of the virus transmitted by local mosquitoes. Previous US cases have been connected to people who caught the virus abroad. Zika causes only a mild illness in most people, but the virus has been linked to severe brain defects in newborns. The US Center for Disease Control does not expect a widespread outbreak of Zika in the country, but says it is preparing for small clusters of infections. Florida has announced more aggressive mosquito-control efforts, and politicians are keen to assure tourists the state is safe to visit. Paul Cosford, medical director and director of health protection at Public Health England, said the risk in Florida was considered ""moderate"", based on the number of cases and control measures in place. ""Pregnant women are advised to consider postponing non-essential travel until after pregnancy. ""Advice to all travellers remains to avoid mosquito bites."" He said Public Health England was monitoring the international situation closely. Risk ratings The advice from Public Health England is based on a list of countries and territories with current active Zika virus transmission as classified by the European Centre for Disease Control. Florida is listed as having a moderate risk rating for the Zika virus, along with Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia and the Philippines. Many more areas, including a number of countries in south and central America and the Caribbean, are categorised as being ""high"" risk. In those countries, the advice is for pregnant women to postpone non-essential travel, rather than just considering postponing. Health Protection Scotland has also updated its advice for travellers following the confirmation of the Zika cases in Florida, while links to Public Health England's guidance are provided on the websites of Public Health Wales and Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency. In terms of the UK, Professor Cosford said more than 50 cases had been diagnosed since January, but the risk to the UK remained unchanged. He said a small number of Zika virus infections in travellers returning to the UK was to be expected, but the risk to the wider population was ""very low"" as the mosquito that spread the virus was not found in the UK. He added: ""If you have recently returned from an area where Zika virus transmissions are currently reported and have a fever or flu-like illness, seek medical attention without delay to exclude malaria and mention your recent travel.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grace Millane killer appeals against conviction and sentence,"The 28-year-old, who cannot be named, was jailed for at least 17 years after a jury found him guilty of murdering Ms Millane in an Auckland hotel in 2018. After her death he hid her body in a suitcase and buried her in bushland. His appeal is based around elements of the trial process as well as the length of the minimum non-parole period. At his trial last year, the killer claimed Ms Millane, who was last seen on the night before her 22nd birthday, had died accidentally, after the pair engaged in rough sex that went too far. But a jury in November rejected that argument and found him guilty of murder. New Zealand media outlet Stuff said the appeal was based around how much emphasis was placed on the element of consent, expert evidence, probability, and the negative evidence given by other women about his character. Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, met her killer on dating app Tinder while travelling in Auckland in December 2018. The trial heard the pair spent the evening drinking before returning to the man's room in the CityLife hotel in central Auckland where he killed her. He then disposed of her body by burying it in a suitcase in the Waitākere Ranges, a mountainous area outside the city. After he was sentenced in February, Ms Millane's mother Gillian told the killer she was ""absolutely heartbroken that you have taken my daughter's future and robbed us of so many memories that we were going to create"". Defence lawyer Rachael Reed QC reportedly told the appeal hearing: ""I do not in any way seek to condone or excuse his actions after Miss Millane's death. I cannot and will not do so - they are inexcusable."" But according to the New Zealand Herald, she argued the jury should have had more direction around consent issues and ""more balanced"" direction on the expert evidence, and said the sentence was ""manifestly unjust"". Crown prosecutors said the appeal grounds around consent instructions were ""flimsy"" and the sentence was not manifestly excessive, the Herald reported. The appeal court has reserved its decision.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cuts to Education Improvement Grant criticised,"By Ben PriceBBC News The cuts were made to the Education Improvement Grant, some of which is used for learning support and translation. Wales' children's commissioner criticised the cuts saying the grant helps ""the most vulnerable"" youngsters. The Welsh Government said it is making sure funding goes to the ""front line"". A spokesman said the Welsh Local Government Association gave assurances schools will be prioritised in funding decisions. Prof Sally Holland, the children's commissioner, said the fund was used in part to help children quickly gain skills and integrate. ""This is not a grant we should be thinking about cutting. I've seen the importance of it in schools,"" she said. ""I've seen the impact on individual children and on wider communities."" Chairwoman of the Children, Young People and Education Committee Lynn Neagle said in a letter to Education Secretary Kirsty Williams that she was disappointed that millions of pounds which included spending on supporting children from Gypsy, Roma and traveller, and minority ethnic backgrounds to learn English was being removed from the fund. Meanwhile the Wales Secretary for the National Education Union David Evans said it is negotiating with the authorities worst affected over possible redundancies. Councils are now having to consider how learners can be best supported. For 2018-19, £7.5m has been set aside to alleviate the impact in the four areas with the highest amount of school learners whose first language is not English or Welsh. In 2016-17, there were 12,199 in Cardiff, 4,220 in Swansea, 4,477 in Newport and 1,681 in Wrexham. Swansea council is consulting on how to provide support in the future, however a spokesman said it has not received any of the cash yet. In Newport, an online petition has been set up calling on local authorities to save the Gwent Education Minority-Ethnic Service it uses. However, Neath Port Talbot council's cabinet member for education Peter Rees said it is ""absolutely disgraceful"" only four authorities have been given the grant. The Welsh Government spokesman said it recognised ""particular challenges for some authorities"", adding: ""We have identified an additional £7.5m which will alleviate the impact and help support the delivery of these services on a regional basis.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Demand for food banks drops slightly in Northern Ireland,"The Trussell Trust said their food bank network distributed more than 32,400 three day food parcels across Northern Ireland in 2017/18. That figure is a 1% drop on the previous year. More than 13,200 emergency food parcels went to children in Northern Ireland. Tony Graham, Northern Ireland director for The Trussell Trust, said any decrease in the need for food banks ""however small, is welcome"". ""No-one in Northern Ireland should be left hungry or destitute,"" he added. ""Illness, disability, family breakdown or the loss of a job could happen to any of us and we owe it to each other to make sure sufficient financial support is in place when we need it most."" Universal Credit The charity said 45% of referrals in Northern Ireland were because people on low incomes or benefits were unable to make ends meet, up from 41% on the previous year. It also pointed to delays in the payment of benefits and benefits changes, including the switch to Universal Credit, as being significant factors. Mr Graham said: ""While the benefits freeze is currently ongoing in Northern Ireland, we hope the flexibilities and mitigations which support people on the lowest incomes are leading to a deceleration in food bank use. ""Universal Credit may not be fully rolled out yet but it is the future of our benefits system. ""It's vital we get it right in Northern Ireland and ensure levels of payment keep pace with the rising cost of essentials, particularly for groups of people we know are already more likely to need a food bank."" Complex reasons He said people living with a disability or illness as well as families with children and single parents were particularly at risk. Across the UK the charity said it saw a 13% increase in emergency food supplies last year. More than 1.3 million three-day food packages were provided by the trust last year. The UK government said the reasons people use food banks are complex. The Department for Work and Pensions said: ""It's wrong to link a rise to any one cause. ""Meanwhile, we continue to spend £90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most,"" said a spokesperson. ""The best way to help people improve their lives is through employment, with people on Universal Credit moving into work faster and staying in work longer.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chris Ramsey's guide for comedians at music festivals,"However, more and more are adding ""non-music"" acts to the line-up. Latitude festival has featured comedians since 2006 and has just announced its biggest line-up yet featuring the likes of Simon Amstell, Katherine Ryan and Dara O Briain. But Chris Ramsey, who has played there twice and will return to Suffolk in July, says it can sometimes be ""hard to mix comedy and music"". Here's his guide for comedians on how to crack a music festival. Don't play at the same time as Skrillex... Chris says it's ""an honour to be asked to play"" but raises a few concerns having been put on next to pretty loud acts at other festivals in the past. ""You don't want to be in a comedy tent when someone like Skrillex is in the tent next door - that's the end of it, you're not going to have a very good gig. ""Latitude's a big place, the bands are on the other side of the field."" ...or after a big name comedian ""When I'm on tour, it's me, it's my show and people have bought tickets to see me. ""So you've got to pray that you're not on straight after a really big name. ""If they're clearing out the tent while you're doing your first couple of jokes - it's pretty painful."" Get there early ""I would say the low point of playing any festival is getting on site,"" Chris tells Newsbeat. Unlike the musicians who will often arrive on tour buses, lots of comedians will drive themselves to the festival before their set. ""There's about 500 different checkpoints of people on their gap year using a walkie-talkie for the first time. ""I've spent longer getting into Latitude than getting out."" His tips for the others on the bill, who include Joel Dommett, Seann Walsh, Andy Parsons, Susan Calman and Dom Joly is to enter ""like a commando"". ""I'm just going to dig a tunnel and pop up in the middle of the tent, do the set and climb back in."" Don't worry if not everyone is there for you See Latitude's tweet ""What you get is a lot of hungover people who come into the tent cross-legged and can't be bothered to dance yet,"" says Chris. ""When you're doing festivals it's a conveyor belt of comedians. ""You've go to be prepared for the first couple of minutes to feel like you're gigging at a shopping centre - there are just people wondering through."" Keep it short and sweet Chris is currently on tour with Is That Chris Ramsey? It's his biggest tour so far and runs for almost two hours. He says he has to approach festival sets in a different way. ""I think my set at Latitude will be 30-40 minutes. ""I'd have to talk really fast and I talk really fast anyway. I just pick my best bits.""

Overwatch pro player suspended over homophobic slur,"Mr Lengyel was suspended by the Overwatch League for four matches and fined $2,000 (£1,433). Overwatch League is the first major professional e-sports league featuring competitions in 12 cities worldwide. E-sports team Dallas Fuel has also suspended him for the rest of the first stage of the competition. Stage one runs from 11 January to 10 February. During his suspension, Mr Lengyel will receive ""focus training, physical training and support"" from the team. The incident occurred on 18 January during a live stream. According to technology blog Engadget, Mr Lengyel directed a homophobic insult at rival team Houston Outlaws player Austin ""Muma"" Wilmot, in response to being taunted over a victory. The Overwatch League said that his comment violated the League's code of conduct. ""The Overwatch League takes standards of player behaviour seriously, whether during league play or otherwise, and is committed to responding swiftly when violations occur,"" the League said in a statement. Dallas Fuel also issued a statement, saying that it hoped that Mr Lengyel would be able to ""improve as a professional player who is reflective of the principles of the Dallas Fuel organisation, his team-mates, and of the Overwatch League"". The e-sports team added: ""No one wants to see Felix succeed more than we do."" 'Toxic environment' The Overwatch League launched on 10 January, and according to Robert Purchese, a senior staff writer at video game website Eurogamer, is a big push by league developers Blizzard to ""cement"" Overwatch as a professional e-sport. ""Increasingly over the last year or so, Overwatch has been linked with and talked about having more and more of a toxic environment in its online community - not just insults only from rival teams, but also from teams insulting their own members,"" he told the BBC. ""Because Blizzard wants the league to launch perfectly, they've come down hard on players, but also trying to show people looking in from the outside that this isn't a toxic game."" Trading insults is a problem affecting almost all online gaming communities, but Mr Purchese said younger people and women have experienced ""the brunt"" of toxic comments while playing Overwatch. ""Blizzard is desperate to get this stuff away from its game. It's an impossible battle, but it should do what it can,"" he said. Although it wasn't related to gaming, the incident of YouTube star Logan Paul posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim is likely to be in the minds of operators of online content streaming services, and making Blizzard and Dallas Fuel wary, he added. However, since e-sports teams are ""big-money ventures"", professional players should be cautioned about what they can say publicly, the same way football players are, said Mr Purchese. ""Football players tend to toe the line a little - they don't speak out the way they do on the pitch,"" he said. ""The fine doesn't mean anything, but the four-match ban might hamper a team's chances, so it might send the right message.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
June Jones murder: Ex-boyfriend jailed for life,"June ""Katie"" Jones, 33, was found wrapped in a rug in her West Bromwich flat on New Year's Eve. A knife had been placed on top of her body. Her ex-partner of eight years, Michael Foran, 33, was jailed for a minimum term of 17 years. He shouted ""I'm sorry"" to his victim's family as he was led from the dock. Latest news from the West Midlands Foran, of no fixed abode, changed his murder plea to guilty on the day he was due to give evidence during his trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court. He had previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter before asking the court clerk to put the murder charge to him again on Friday. The court heard Ms Jones had been killed around 10 December but was only discovered on 31 December after she was reported missing by her sister on Boxing Day. His Honour Judge James Burbidge QC told the court Foran had strangled Ms Jones with such force he damaged her voicebox, before he stabbed her in the neck and chest. ""You left her to die without dignity, without compassion, in the bath. Only you and she know how this came to be but she is not in a position to tell anyone. ""She was vulnerable and in no position to counter an attack on her. There were no defensive injuries on her body. ""What sparked that attack I do not know."" In a statement released by police, Ms Jones' family said: ""Today, justice has been done for our beloved Katie. ""Finally, Michael Foran faced up to the gravity of the overwhelming evidence against him, forcing him to plead guilty to Katie's murder."" Moran was arrested in Liverpool after being found begging on the streets with a dog. Co-accused Keith O'Dwyer, 35, of Camberley House, West Bromwich, also changed his plea, admitting assisting Moran to travel to Liverpool. He was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment for assisting an offender. West Midlands Police had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC) over the case. The police watchdog said it had handed the matter back to the force to investigate. Det Insp Nick Barnes, from the force's homicide team, said: ""Katie was murdered in the most horrific circumstances. The level of violence used by Foran was despicable. ""I hope his acknowledgement of guilt offers some comfort to Katie's family, who have been extremely brave throughout this traumatic time.""

Anorexic woman's death prompted independent review,"Madeline Wallace, from Peterborough, died in January 2018 from sepsis. An independent review highlighted a lack of knowledge about complications, such as infection, by GPs and hospital A&E staff. The inquest heard Ms Wallace, 18, visited A&E and her GP surgery in the days before her death but an infection went undiagnosed. Ms Wallace was more susceptible and less able to fight infection due to her anorexia, the coroner was told. The independent review of her care was commissioned by Cambridge and Peterborough Clinical Commissioning Group following concerns raised by her family. It made 14 recommendations for changes to prevent gaps in care at a national and regional level, the inquest heard. They included advice for A&E staff and GPs on anorexia complications and a need for quicker blood test results taken during regular GP check-ups to be shared more quickly with eating disorder specialists to prevent ""worrying"" signs not being picked up. Maria Dineen, who wrote the report, said: ""It would help in recognising signs, it will make a significant difference for vulnerable people in the future."" The inquest previously heard Ms Wallace had been rejected for an urgent hospital admission in the days before her death and sent home with antibiotics. Dr Jaco Serfontein told the inquest it would likely be ""difficult"" for general doctors to pick on on potential signs of infection in regular anorexia blood tests, unless the person also showed symptoms. Ms Wallace's family said she had told a GP and A&E staff about chest pain but infection was not diagnosed until an emergency hospital admission. Following the review North West Anglia Foundation Trust, which runs Peterborough City Hospital where Ms Wallace died, said it had made changes recommended in the report, including automatically notifying GPs of any hospital admissions. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust said changes were being made to how it monitored high risk patients. The inquest continues.

Scallop row: UK and France agree 'principles of deal',"No UK vessels will fish for scallops in the Bay of Seine during the period when the French are not allowed to catch. A joint statement from the two governments said talks in London on Wednesday had been ""constructive"". But a finalised deal hinges on a ""reasonable compensation package"" for smaller British boats, which lose out. Around 40 French boats clashed with five UK crafts off the coast of northern France last week. Talks were held between representatives of the UK and French fishing industries and Defra officials on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve tensions. Regulations allow British boats to fish in the Bay of Seine, a scallop-rich area off the Normandy coast, all year round. But French fishermen are banned from taking scallops from the area between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. A previous industry agreement prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from fishing for scallops in the area during that period too, but smaller boats were free to do so. The deal agreed in principle on Wednesday would prevent smaller boats from taking advantage of this window. Those vessels will be compensated for their losses, with the amount to be agreed at a meeting in Paris on Friday. But a UK industry representative involved in the talks said the deal would only be finalised if British fishermen did not lose out. Jim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said: ""I'm very pleased that we've negotiated a deal which satisfies the honour of fishermen on both sides. ""The French are in a hurry to make sure that it happens because what they don't want either is another conflict. ""Quite frankly, if it's not good enough on Friday, it will be rejected."" He added he was ""pleased"" the French had expressed ""regret"" during the talks for the recent clashes. All British boats have been asked to voluntarily stop fishing for scallops in the conflict area until a deal is finalised. Speaking after the talks, French industry representative Pascal Coquet said it was a ""good deal"". The talks were held after French and British boats clashed off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation. What exactly happened? The French boats gathered overnight on Monday last week in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away and two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The British crews say they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Israel enables emergency spy powers,"By Joe TidyCyber-security reporter The new powers will be used to enforce quarantine and warn those who may have come into contact with infected people. The temporary laws were passed during an overnight sitting of the cabinet, bypassing parliamentary approval. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel called the move ""a dangerous precedent and a slippery slope"". Such powers are usually reserved for counter-terrorism operations. Details of how the ""cyber-monitoring"" will work were not disclosed but it is understood the location data collected through telecommunication companies by Shin Bet, the domestic security agency, will be shared with health officials. Once an individual is highlighted as a possible coronavirus case, the health ministry will then be able to track whether or not they are adhering to quarantine rules. It can also send a text message to people who may have come into contact with them before symptoms emerged. The head of the justice system said the move would save lives, while Israel's prime minister said it struck a balance between public-health needs and civil rights. Israel is still in the relatively early stages of the pandemic - and many ordinary Israelis are used to complying with measures they see as important for their security. But this is a public health threat, not a security one. The ultimate test of bolstering the powers of surveillance agencies will lie in their longer term effectiveness: whether they can slow the spread of the coronavirus. Some are uneasy. In an often tense and divided region, increasingly parts of the security infrastructure are doubling up as tools of public-health enforcement by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities. The scale and duration of the health and economic crises may strain that situation. Israel has confirmed more than 300 cases of the virus and imposed a series of other measures to stop the spread. They include closing schools, shopping centres, restaurants and most places of leisure, as well as limiting gatherings to 10 people. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the new powers will last for 30 days only. Speaking ahead of the vote, he said: ""Israel is a democracy and we must maintain the balance between civil rights and the public's needs. ""These tools will very much assist us in locating the sick and stopping the virus from spreading."" Although it is shrouded in secrecy, other countries are believed to collect data from mobile phones to be used in mass-surveillance programmes or in specific criminal investigations that require case-by-case legal permission. China's sophisticated mass surveillance system is also being used to keep a tab on infected individuals. Tencent, the company behind popular messaging app WeChat, has launched a QR-code-based tracking feature. The ""close contact detector"" app notifies the user if they have been in close contact with a virus carrier and enforce quarantines. In South Korea, similar technology has been criticised for an invasion of privacy as some people were accused of having extramarital affairs based on their location data being made public.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
H&M stores in South Africa trashed over 'racist' hoodie,"The protests were organised by the radical Economic Freedom Fighters' party (EFF). H&M apologised several days ago for the image, which ran on its website. It featured a young black boy modelling a green hoodie with ""coolest monkey in the jungle"" written on it. The retailer withdrew both the product and the image after it sparked outrage and allegations of racism on social media. ""We're deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print,"" it said in a statement. Video footage showed activists trashing displays, kicking over clothes rails and shoving mannequins. Floyd Shivambu, an MP from the EFF, tweeted: ""That @hm nonsense of a clothing store is now facing consequences for its racism. All rational people should agree that the store should not be allowed to continue operating in South Africa."" South African Police (SAPS) also tweeted about the vandalism, writing: ""Several incidents of protests at H&M stores around the province have been reported. ""At the East Rand Mall the protesters managed to enter the shop & stole several items. #SAPS members had to intervene and dispersed the group of protesters by firing rubber bullets."" EFF leader Julius Malema defended the rampage, saying: ""We make no apology about what the fighters did today."" ""We are not going to allow anyone to use the colour of our skin to humiliate us, to exclude us,"" he added. While consumers in several countries had called for a boycott of H&M as the picture went viral, the mother of the child model has said that she did not find it offensive. She said the hoodie was ""one of hundreds of outfits my son has modelled"", and urged people to ""stop crying wolf all the time"". Addressing the EFF store takeovers, she tweeted that ""apartheid and racism [have] corrupted some so much that this is thought to be reasonable in response to a hoodie with the word ""monkey"" on it"". More than one celebrity has cut their ties with H&M over the hoodie row. Singer The Weeknd, who had collaborated with the company, said the advert made him feel ""shocked and embarrassed"". He was joined by rapper G-Eazy, who had been due to bring out a clothing line with H&M in March. ""I can't allow for my name and brand to be associated with a company that could let this happen,"" the musician said. ""I hope that this situation will serve as the wake up call that H&M and other companies need to get on track and become racially and culturally aware, as well as more diverse at every level.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boris Johnson's 'union adviser' Oliver Lewis quits after two weeks,"Oliver Lewis, an ally of the prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was a key part of the campaign for the UK to leave the EU. His departure comes as the Scottish National Party is calling for another referendum on independence. Mr Lewis was confirmed in his role just two weeks ago. He replaced Luke Graham, a former Conservative MP. Downing Street declined to comment on staffing matters. Following Mr Lewis's departure, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted: ""Disunity in the Union unit. Or maybe just despair at realising how threadbare the case for it is."" The SNP's Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald claimed Mr Johnson's ""taxpayer-funded anti-independence campaign is completely falling apart"". ""As support for independence grows, the Tories are losing advisers like rats on a sinking ship,"" she said. ""People in Scotland have a right to determine their own future in a post-pandemic referendum."" Aside from the pandemic, protecting the union is one of Boris Johnson's key challenges in the coming months. The SNP will demand another referendum if they win the Holyrood election in May - while the impact of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland is still playing out. Oliver Lewis was appointed head of the Union unit at the start of the month and was seen as an important player in Number 10 who had Mr Johnson's ear. So his departure a fortnight later shows all is not well in Downing Street. Far from it. Sources say Mr Lewis was the victim of a(nother) power struggle - after personnel changes at the heart of government last week. In particular, it seems Mr Lewis found it hard to work with another special adviser, Henry Newman, who was brought into the Number 10 operation last week. Mr Newman is extremely close to the prime minister's fiancée, Carrie Symonds. Around Westminster, these power struggles are fascinating. But the fear some around Mr Johnson have is that they keep happening - and it shows an operation where the ship is still not particularly steady. In the words of one source: ""Everything just needs to settle down in there."" Read more from Nick. Mr Johnson has said another referendum on Scottish independence - following the last one in 2014 - should not happen, describing it as a ""once-in-a-generation"" vote. Mr Lewis was research director of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 EU membership referendum, writing its manifesto. He joined the UK government as an adviser on Brexit policy before taking up his role defending the union.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
PM Narendra Modi says India will extend coronavirus lockdown until 3 May,"The announcement comes on what was to be the last day of the initial lockdown, which began on 25 March. “I salute all you citizens,” Mr Modi said in a televised address, thanking Indians for their support in the fight against the virus. India has reported 8,988 active cases and 339 deaths so far. Under the lockdown, only essential businesses - such as groceries and pharmacies - are allowed to remain open. City transport services are limited to emergency staff and those with special travel passes. All trains and flights have been suspended. Mr Modi suggested that the rules could tighten further over the next week, but he did not give more details. He said the government will issue ""guidelines"" soon. ""These have been made thinking of our poor and migrant workers, daily-wage workers and farmers,"" he said. He added that the federal and state governments will be watching potential hotspots closely, and will evaluate every district in a week's time to determine if restrictions can be eased anywhere. The heavy economic and social cost of India's lockdown India's grinding lockdown has already caused economic disruption and social distress. It has hurt the economy immensely. Joblessness has risen sharply, according to an independent assessment. India's already sputtering economy is now expected to grow between 1.5-2.8% in 2020-21, according to the World Bank. Migrant workers, the backbone of key service industries, have either fled their shuttered workplaces or are stranded in homeless centres in cities. The thriving informal economy is in tatters. Access to food, medicines and emergency medical care for non-Covid-19 patients has become difficult for the poor. The lockdown, says an economist, ""seems to be the case of the privileged transferring their epidemic risk to the under-privileged"". There is no doubt that lifting the lockdown at a time when India is seeing a rise in infections and trying to catch up on testing, can be risky. At the same time, it is also abundantly clear that India will have to ease the lockdown to save the economy and livelihoods of people. Some economic activity - farming, transportation of goods, wholesale markets, key gig economy services - has to reopen with social distancing and hygiene protocols. How this will be implemented will depend purely on the acumen of the states. Seven states and one federally-administered territory have already extended the lockdown. The decision has come at a huge economic cost, with unemployment on the rise and businesses struggling to function amid the restrictions. Experts also fear that it may affect farming, which employs more than half of India’s workforce. The restrictions have already had a devastating effect on India’s poor and homeless, and ended up stranding hundreds of thousands of migrant workers across cities. Experts around the world are closely watching the virus’ spread in India, which has a population of 1.3bn. They fear that the country - with its densely-populated cities and weak public health system - is particularly vulnerable to the pandemic’s worst effects.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China seeks to combat hi-tech crimewave,"The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks ""threatened internet safety"". Crime spree The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. Hacked accounts The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. ""The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety,"" the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read ""Do you have a conscience?"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Natalie Hemming murder: Jealous partner jailed for life,"Paul Hemming beat mother-of-three Natalie Hemming, 31, to death in the lounge of their Milton Keynes home while their children slept upstairs. Miss Hemming was found dead in woodland at Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire, on 22 May, 21 days after she disappeared. Hemming, 43, was found guilty at Luton Crown Court and told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years. The noise of the attack woke the couple's six-year-old son, who went downstairs. When he peeked through a gap in the door he saw his mother's body, which by then his father had wrapped in a blanket. Not realising she had been killed and fearing he would be told off for being awake, he crept back to his bedroom. Zoo trip When the youngster and his two sisters got up the next morning, their father claimed their mother had left the house while they were asleep. He then took them to Whipsnade Zoo for a day out. Hours earlier, while the children slept, Hemming had carried his partner's naked body out of the house, transferred it in the boot of his car and driven 30 miles from the family home in Alderney Avenue, Newton Leys, Milton Keynes, to Toms Wood, Chandlers Cross, south Hertfordshire. There, he dragged her corpse by her feet into thick undergrowth. He left her face down beneath the trees, where she was found three weeks later by a man who had been mowing a meadow nearby. Hemming had earlier admitted manslaughter, claiming he never meant to kill Miss Hemming or cause her serious bodily harm. 'Lack of remorse' He claimed she died when he threw a heavy ornament at her which, he said, accidentally hit her on the head. Hemming said by the time he got to her she was not breathing and he knew she was dead. But Simon Russell-Flint QC, for the prosecution, said Miss Hemming had been killed ""in a fit of rage and jealousy"" when Hemming learnt she had been unfaithful to him and was planning to leave him and take the children. In sentencing, Judge Richard Foster told Hemming: ""Natalie Hemming knew, you were overbearing, controlling, jealous and on occasions violent. You said you would mend your ways but you did not. ""The manner in which you have conducted yourself since the murder indicates a complete lack of remorse."" The judge passed a concurrent sentence of five years for the offences of obstructing the coroner and preventing Natalie's lawful burial.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Crash for cash: Five more guilty over insurance scam,"They were convicted of making six insurance claims worth £144,000 between 2009 and 2011. Two were found not guilty. It brings the total number of convictions in the scam - which involved the deliberate damaging of vehicles - to 81. The case involved 28 separate claims and 57 cars, Cardiff Crown Court heard. The fraud ring cost the insurance industry £763,068. It operated out of a garage based in Pengam, Blackwood, which was known as both St David's Crash Repair and Easifix and owned by the Yandell family. They were the masterminds of the scam, Gwent Police said, and they provided the insurance fraud service for scores of friends and relatives. Caught by their CCTV But they were eventually caught by their own CCTV, driving a Land Rover into a forklift truck to make it look like the car had been in an accident. Byron Yandell, 32, his father Peter Yandell, 53 and wife Rachel Yandell, 31, along with Gavin Yandell, 31, and Michelle Yandell, 52, were all jailed for between six and two years. Following the verdicts, Catrin Evans, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Wales complex casework unit, said the operation was ""a highly-organised, calculated and extensive conspiracy to defraud"". ""It involved defendants participating in the arrangement of fake road traffic accidents and insurance fraud,"" she said. ""The vast majority of cars supposedly involved in these fake accidents were recovered to a single garage that was at the centre of the criminal operation."" Ben Fletcher, director of the Insurance Fraud Bureau, said ""Crash for cash scams, such as Operation Dino, have a real impact on society, putting the lives of innocent people at risk and costing honest policy holders almost £350m each year. ""These investigations and convictions send a powerful message to the public that if you are committing insurance fraud then the risk of being caught and prosecuted is very real. The IFB works alongside insurers and police forces up and down the country to detect fraudsters and bring them to justice.""

Wiltshire Police chief Mike Veale accused of misconduct,"Claims Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Mike Veale deliberately damaged a police-owned mobile phone are being probed by the police watchdog. Wiltshire PCC Angus Macpherson said Mr Veale's contract had not been renewed because of the investigation. Mr Veale has since accepted a job as Cleveland Police's chief. He had previously been criticised over Wiltshire Police's handling of Operation Conifer, an investigation into historical child sex abuse allegations against former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath. Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson said nothing in the allegations caused him ""to question either the fact or the outcome of Operation Conifer"". Cleveland PCC Barry Coppinger said he had been aware of the IOPC investigation and had taken professional advice on the matter. He said: ""This matter has no bearing on my confidence in Mike or my decision to recommend him for the office of chief constable."" However, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said the investigation ""massively"" affected his confidence over Mr Veale's appointment at Cleveland Police. He said: ""We've got a police force that's also under a massive investigation. This just isn't good enough. ""He shouldn't be taking charge. Barry Coppinger and Cleveland Police really need to seriously consider Mike's position because it's not right for the people of the Tees Valley. ""The people deserve much better than what they're getting from their force at the moment."" 'Series of allegations' A statement from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said: ""We received a referral from the Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner in November 2017 detailing anonymous allegations about Chief Constable Mike Veale relating to Wiltshire's investigation into Sir Edward Heath. ""After a thorough assessment, we decided the part of the referral relating to the disclosure of confidential information was insufficient to indicate either a criminal offence may have been committed or a breach of professional standards. ""That matter has been returned to the Police and Crime Commissioner to deal with in any manner determined appropriate. ""The IOPC has however decided to independently investigate a second part of the referral relating to allegations that a mobile phone belonging to Wiltshire Police was deliberately damaged by Chief Constable Mike Veale. ""This investigation is in its early stages."" Mr Macpherson said he received an anonymous letter making ""a series of allegations"" against Mr Veale and said, although he had ""every confidence in him"", it would not have been appropriate to renew his contract until the investigation was complete.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Young Tamils in Sri Lanka 'being held without charge',"By Charles HavilandBBC News, Colombo Nanda Godage said some had been incarcerated in this way for years. He was testifying before a war commission, which is examining the final years of the long-running civil conflict which ended last year. The commission also looks at ways of preventing war from breaking out again. Mr Godage, a former Sri Lankan ambassador to the European Union, told the commission that at least 2,000 young Tamils had been in detention for years on suspicion of involvement with the Tamil Tiger rebels. These were in addition to several thousand people who had been held in camps since the end of the fighting last year, he said. They had been failed by the legal system, he alleged. By holding them in this way, he charged, the Sri Lankan state was in danger of ""breeding many more Prabhakarans"" - a reference to Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the Tamil Tigers who met his death as the war ended. Mr Godage told the BBC he was especially angry about 500 young people who were being held purely on suspicion in a Colombo jail, Welikada, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. If there was no evidence against them and the others, they should be freed, he said, although he acknowledged that the security of the state was vital. Forgotten He told the panel of a case he said was typical: a Tamil engineer who admitted to the police that he had given money to the Tigers while working in the UK. The man had spent more than a year in prison despite explaining that many Tamils abroad were forced to make such donations. The retired diplomat said some top officials sympathised with these detainees, but that complex bureaucracy meant they were forgotten about. Former Tamil Tiger members or suspects who are still alive are receiving mixed treatment in Sri Lanka. The most senior of them, nicknamed KP, is nominally detained, but is co-operating with the government in building links with the Tamil diaspora. Another senior ex-Tiger has just told the BBC that he is helping to run a television station in the north while out on bail from a court case.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Leave.EU founder confirms he funded Nigel Farage in year after referendum,"Items paid for by Arron Banks included Mr Farage's London home, his car and trips to the US to meet Donald Trump. A spokesman for Mr Banks confirmed the amount and what it had been used for, saying it was an ""honour to help"". Asked about the funding following an investigation by Channel 4 News, Mr Farage - who now leads the Brexit party - said it was a private matter. Speaking at the launch of the Brexit party campaign in Scotland, Mr Farage said he did not declare it to the European Parliament because he was about to leave politics and had been seeking a new life in the US. He added his actions had been non-political. Mr Farage has been a member of the European Parliament since 1999. He led UKIP in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, campaigning alongside Leave.EU, of which Mr Banks was a major financier. Mr Farage stepped down as leader later the same year, but remained as an MEP. In March this year, he launched the Brexit Party and is now leading it to fight the European elections. When campaigning in Dudley, West Midlands, Mr Farage was asked if he had received £450,000 from Mr Banks and said ""unfortunately not"", adding that if he had, ""it would be lovely"". But in a statement, Mr Banks said Mr Farage ""would not have had a clue how much things would have cost"". The Leave.EU founder said he had ""willingly helped Farage and was honoured to do so"", adding: ""This was all designed to help Nigel get out of politics."" ""I considered it an honour to help and would do it happily again,"" Mr Banks said. Those close to Mr Banks also said the help he provided Mr Farage had nothing to do with politics, but was more about helping a friend get on with the next stage of his life. A spokesman for the European Parliament said that MEPs have to declare any spending linked to political activity that is paid for by third parties. Mr Farage is currently touring the country to campaign for his new Brexit Party ahead of next week's European elections. The party received £750,000 of funding in its first 10 days, and donations are reported to have now topped £2m, with one donor - former Tory backer businessman Jeremy Hosking - saying he had pledged £200,000. But the sources of all its funding do not legally need to be declared until after the European elections.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The four-year spread of bubble tea across the UK,"Magazine MonitorA collection of cultural artefacts It is often brightly coloured, sometimes served with milk, with a layer of jelly-like globules - tapioca balls - that settle at the bottom of the cup. Drunk through an extra thick straw with a spoon-shaped tip, it is a mouthful of tea and chewiness - both a drink and a snack, Chorley in Lancashire got its first bubble tea bar in July. Huddersfield has Bubble n Shake, there is a mobile bubble tea van in Bristol, and it can be found in cities from Glasgow to Portsmouth. ""It's chewy and odd,"" says restaurant critic Marina O'Loughlin. ""It's slippery and strange, but weirdly more-ish. I love the way it comes with a flat straw so I can scoop out the balls and they plop into my mouth."" Bubble tea hails from 1980s Taiwan. It was an evolution from the country's street tea vendors who began experimenting with fruity flavours and colour to entice customers. The ""bubble"" actually refers to the froth on top of the drink which comes after it is violently shaken - some cafes use a machine especially for shaking. How the tapioca balls arrived in the drink is a matter of debate - though the most common story is that product development manager Lin Hsiu Hui was sitting in a staff meeting and poured the tapioca from her pudding into her Assam iced tea. The result was considered delicious. Assad Khan, a former investment banker, opened the UK's first bubble tea shop in Soho, London, in 2011. He came across the drink in a ""small hole-in-the-wall cafe in New York"", and now has his own Bubbleology cafes across Europe and the Middle East. ""It's an absolute phenomenon,"" he says. ""It is something that at first was a bit difficult to grasp, it's a different taste experience, but I never had any doubt that it would work. ""My favourite flavour is taro milk, which is a root vegetable, lilac in colour."" While growing in the UK, it is even more popular in Germany, according to market research firm Mintel. Even McDonald's has started serving it. Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Prince Charles honours Irish dead at Glasnevin cemetery,"The couple took part in ceremonies at Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetery. They paid tribute to Victoria Cross recipients and to the almost 500 people who died in the failed 1916 rebellion against Britain rule. The couple's four-day visit to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will end later on Friday. 'Banter' It will culminate with an event hosted by the British ambassador in Dublin. The royal couple spoke with Irish politicians on Friday, including Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny and Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams. Mr Adams said the prince had commiserated with him over the death of Martin McGuinness, the IRA paramilitary-turned-peacemaker who died in March. The pair ""enjoyed some banter"" about which of them was the oldest, added Mr Adams. On Friday, the prince and the Republic of Ireland's Arts and Heritage Minister Heather Humphreys laid wreaths at the Cross of Sacrifice in Glasnevin Cemetery that honours those killed during the two world wars. The prince also took part in a ceremony unveiling stones remembering the four Irish soldiers who were awarded Victoria Crosses 100 years ago. He toured the republican plot in the cemetery and visited the graves of Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera. After that, he unveiled another wreath at a wall in Glasnevin that remembers all those who died during the Easter Rising in 1916. On Thursday, Prince Charles tried his hand at hurling at Kilkenny Castle. He and the Duchess of Cornwall also enjoyed a demonstration of the ancient Irish sport. Their visit to the Republic of Ireland, which followed a stay in Northern Ireland, was at the request of the British government. They also visited the Curragh Military Camp, where Irish UN peace-keeping soldiers are trained. On Thursday morning, the Royals visited a farmers' market in Kilkenny, and they met some of the thousands of people who had lined the streets there. The couple left Northern Ireland on Wednesday, after Prince Charles opened a garden of remembrance for police officers killed on duty in Northern Ireland.

Brexit fishing law a 'missed opportunity' for Wales,"The UK Fisheries Bill will, if passed, set the rules over commercial fishing in the UK after Brexit. But the environment committee said the bill fails to address the issue of the quota and will stop the Welsh fishing industry from developing. The UK Government said the committee's claims are ""simply not true"". In its report, the climate change and environment committee said Wales is entitled to 1% of the UK fishing quota, under the agreement used to share out the fishing allocation. The quota refers to the rules regarding the amount of fish that can be caught in the seas. The committee received reports of Welsh fisherman having ""to stand on the quay, unable to go to sea to catch fish, because they don't have the quotas"", while watching vessels from other nations taking the fish. Fishermen called the current rules ""unfair"". The committee also said the Welsh Government has not done enough to secure improvements in Wales' quota share. ""Leaving the Common Fisheries Policy will provide a unique opportunity for the UK and Wales to rethink their approach to fisheries policy,"" said Mike Hedges, chairman of the committee. ""In order to take up these opportunities, it is crucial to address Wales' current quota allocation, which we believe is fundamentally unfair. ""We are deeply disappointed that the UK government has decided that this issue will not be addressed as the UK leaves the EU. Unless this matter is revisited, the benefits for Welsh fisheries arising from Brexit will be marginal."" The Welsh Government said: ""The Fisheries Bill is not the mechanism to take forward detailed negotiations between UK administrations, or between the UK and the European Union, on issues such as quota share. ""We continue to press the case around quota shares with the other UK administrations as part of separate discussions."" The department for environment, food and rural affairs said: ""It is simply not true to say the Fisheries Bill doesn't deliver for the Welsh fishing industry. The bill creates more powers than ever before for the Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales. ""Our priority is to negotiate a fairer share that will benefit the whole of the UK, and new legislation about quota shares is not necessary.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
EA games web server hacked to host phishing website now fixed,"The website that was put in place by hackers asked users to enter their Apple IDs - the credentials needed to access services like Apple's iTunes. A second screen then asked users to enter further personal information, including credit card details. EA said the problem had been found and hacking attempts had been stopped. Paul Mutton, from Netcraft, the internet security company that uncovered the hack, said in a blog that it was likely a vulnerability in an online calendar application hosted on the web server had been exploited by the attackers. The calendar based on the web server was an old version of software that had since been updated, he said. ""The mere presence of old software can often provide sufficient incentive for a hacker to target one system over another, and to spend more time looking for additional vulnerabilities,"" he wrote. Once a user has entered their Apple ID and password on the fake website they are then asked to verify their name, date of birth, phone number and credit card details among other information. Users were then directed to the legitimate Apple ID website, said Mr Mutton. It was reported earlier in the year that other servers belonging to EA had been hacked, causing problems for users trying to log on to online games and services. A hacking group known as Derp posted a tweet claiming responsibility for that attack. Mr Mutton said he had reported the most recent problems to Electronic Arts. In a statement to the BBC, EA said: ""We found it, we have isolated it, and we are making sure such attempts are no longer possible."" Michael Sutton, from security research firm Zscaler, said that hackers using legitimate websites to host malicious content was now the norm. ""Social engineering attacks always involve an element of communication - the victim must be tricked into performing an action such as providing data, clicking on a link, downloading a file, et cetera. Attackers have learned that it's far easier to simply infect an already popular web property than to attempt communication with victims directly,"" he said. Users should check that websites are secure before entering any private information, says guidance from Get Safe Online. They should look for a padlock symbol in the browser window frame and they should check that the web address begins with https - the ""s"" stands for secure. The advice also says that users should check the address in the browser's address bar after arriving at a website to check that it matches what they actually typed.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"WW2's 'Spitfire Women': Eleanor Wadsworth, one of last female pilots, dies","Eleanor Wadsworth, who was 103, was part of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), a civilian service that transported fighter aircraft and crew. The ATA Association said she was among 165 women who flew without radios or instrument flying instructions. Mrs Wadsworth, who lived in Bury St Edmunds, died in December after a month of illness. During the war, about 1,250 men and women from 25 countries transferred some 309,000 aircraft of 147 different types. Mrs Wadsworth, who was born in Nottingham, joined the ATA in 1943 after seeing an advertisement for female pilots and was one of the first six successful candidates to be accepted with no or little previous flying experience, historian Sally McGlone said. In 2020, the former pilot told her housing association's in-house magazine that she had been ""looking for a new challenge"" when she joined the service. ""The thought of learning to fly for free was a great incentive [so] I put my name down and didn't think much about it,"" she said. She added that she had enjoyed flying Spitfires the most, which she did 132 times. ""It was a beautiful aircraft, great to handle,"" she said. Tributes have been paid to her bravery on social including one from former RAF Tornado navigator and Gulf prisoner of war John Nichol. Ms McGlone said Mrs Wadsworth and her fellow ATA pilots ""will remain an inspiration to women worldwide"", while fellow historian Howard Cook said she and her fellow ""Spitfire Women"" had been ""incredibly brave"". Author Karen Borden, who interviewed Mrs Wadsworth for an upcoming book, added that ""like many of the women pilots, she was incredibly humble about her contribution to the war effort"". ""She joked about how flying 'straight and level' was her mark... and how marvellous it was to take to the air on her own."" Her son Robert said she had been ""a wonderful mother, an adoring grandmother and great-grandmother"", who had been ""matter of fact"" about her wartime service. He said she would say that ""we had a job to do [and] we just got on and did it"". Her funeral will take place on Tuesday. Mrs Wadsworth had been one of three surviving female ATA pilots, alongside American Nancy Stratford and Briton Jaye Edwards, who lives in Canada.

Northamptonshire 1930 'blazing car murder': Nine families shortlisted,"The man was hit over the head and set alight in a Morris Minor in what was known as the Northamptonshire ""blazing car murder"". His killer was hanged. Nine families whose missing relatives match the circumstances surrounding the case are due to be DNA tested. Dr John Bond, forensic science expert at the University of Leicester, said he was ""really excited"" by the progress. ""Philanderer"" Alfred Rouse, who may not have known the victim's identity, was having money problems and wanted to fake his own death. He hit the man over the head, placed him in his Morris Minor and set it alight in the village of Hardingstone. He fled to Cardiff but was later convicted of murder and hanged at Bedford Jail. Last year, scientists at the University of Northumbria managed to extract a single, uncontaminated DNA profile from the victim. It was thought the man could have been 23-year-old factory worker William Briggs, but the DNA of his family failed to match. Following appeals including on BBC's The One Show, 15 cases have since been whittled down to nine strong leads. Alfred Rouse Newspaper reports from the time said Rouse had suffered a head wound in World War One, which left him with a personality disorder. He was described as ""a promiscuous rake with an enormous sexual appetite"" and it is understood he fathered at least two illegitimate children. He had child support orders imposed on him, leaving him with severe financial problems. At the time, police believed he had probably picked up a homeless tramp, who would not be missed if he disappeared, and wanted the car fire to look as if he had died in a crash. He placed the body in the driver's seat and left some of his own possessions inside before setting it on fire. Rouse hoped the fire would go unnoticed in the early hours of the morning after Bonfire Night but two young men saw the flames and went to investigate. The car's registration plate was still intact, identifying its owner Rouse, who had fled to Cardiff but was arrested and eventually tried for murder. Dr Bond, who is involved in the identification, said: ""I am really excited about the prospect of at last giving a name to the victim of the 'blazing car murder'. ""It is quite a sobering thought that many people went missing in the 1930s never to be seen again by their families, and to now be able to give some closure to those families makes this investigation worthwhile. ""The families we will now be profiling have both an unbroken maternal line to their missing relative and good circumstantial evidence to the crime scene or Rouse, the offender."" DNA sampling kits are being sent to the nine families and it is hoped experts can start comparing profiles later this year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fonseka political prisoner - former CJ,"Launching an online petition calling for the release of Gen Fonseka, former CJ Sarath Nanda Silva said his arrest is illegal according to the constitution and the international law. Mr. Silva was the first to add his name to the online petition in freesarathfonseka website. ""With authority I can say that Gen Sarath Fonseka is a political prisoner,"" the controversial former CJ said. Court martial ""There are certain rules and regulations to arrest or detain a person according to the law in this country. But now all those avenues are blocked. I think the international community might see Sri Lanka as a lawless country."" However, Mr. Silva as the CJ once ruled that Sri Lanka does not have to follow international conventions as they are a 'threat to the soverignty' of the country. A bench chaired by Mr. Silva in 2006 ruled that although Sri Lanka has signed the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant has not been incorporated into the constitution. Addressing opposition political leaders and others gathered at the Gen Fonseka's political office in Colombo on Monday, he said Sri Lanka was the first country in the region to establish the Supreme Court in 1802. Accusing unnamed law experts of trying to justify the arrest of Gen Fonseka, the former CJ said, that the detention was illegal as any person arrested should be brought to a court of law within 24 hours. The government recently announced that the former Chief of Defence Staff would face charges in a civil court alleging that he helped his relatives make illicit profits, created disaffection in the armed forces, harboured deserters, and broke foreign exchange laws, in addition to military charges. Human Rights Commission However, Mr. Silva argued that the military law, which also comes under the country's constitution and international law, does not apply to the retired general. Journalists attending the launch of the website say that the UNF leadership was conspicuous by their absence. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) has recommended that investigations should be carried out by those who are unbiased towards the defeated presidential candidate. The recommendations handed over to the defence secretary have been made by the SLHRC after visiting the detained military leader in Sri Lanka navy headquarters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Amazonian groups sue French supermarket chain over deforestation,"The 11 indigenous groups, backed by NGOs in the US and France, are seeking €3.1m ($3.7m; £2.7m) in damages. In a statement, the groups linked Casino meat to an area of deforestation ""five times the size of Paris"". Casino told AFP and Reuters news agencies that it took a ""rigorous"" approach to its supply chains. The company is being taken to court under a French law enacted in 2017. Under the law, businesses must avoid human rights and environmental violations in their supply chains. The indigenous groups from Brazil and Colombia have accused Casino of ""damages done to their customary lands and the impact on their livelihoods"". In the statement they said deforestation in South America, particularly in Brazil, was mainly driven by cattle ranching. ""According to evidence compiled and analysed by the Center for Climate Crime Analysis for this case, Groupe Casino regularly bought beef from three slaughterhouses owned by JBS,"" a meatpacking company accused of deforestation, they said in a joint statement. ""The three slaughterhouses sourced cattle from 592 suppliers responsible for at least 50,000 hectares of deforestation between 2008 and 2020... The deforested area is five times the size of Paris."" Casino also controls Brazil's largest food retailer, Grupo Pão de Açucar (GPA), and Colombian retailer Almacenes Éxito. The indigenous groups also accuse Casino of violating indigenous rights, and cite one case in particular in which indigenous lands were invaded and used by cattle farms that supplied beef to GPA. ""The demand for beef by Casino and Pão de Açucar brings deforestation and land-grabbing and violence, and the murder of indigenous leaders when they choose to resist,"" Luiz Eloy Terena, a leader of Brazil's Terena people, said in the statement. ""With this lawsuit, we seek to hold the company accountable for the consequences of these impacts and to bring some relief to the reality confronted by our indigenous peoples on their lands."" Casino told Reuters news agency that its Brazilian-sourced beef was not sold in its French shops. GPA also told the agency that in 2016 it set out criteria that its suppliers must comply with - including ""zero Amazon deforestation, no slave-like condition, no child labour and no invasions of indigenous land or conservation areas"".

Chinese police uncover huge fake jellyfish 'scam',"By Martin YipBBC Chinese Police said the fake jellyfish had been made by mixing chemicals, adding that checks showed high levels of aluminium. The syndicates made more than 170,000 yuan (£18,100; $26,100) in profits in a year of production, they added. Jellyfish is very popular sliced and served as salad, particularly along China's southern and eastern coasts. Huzhou municipal police in Zhejiang province, which is leading the investigation said they first found a workshop run by a Mr Yuan, who made and sold the fake jellyfish at a farmer's market. Mr Yuan then led detectives to a bigger workshop in Changzhou city in neighbouring Jiangsu province run by a Mr Jia who had taught him the ""art"" of faking jellyfish. He was detained alongside other syndicate members. The arrests were made in late April, but police only made it public late last week Is fake jellyfish harmful? Mr Yuan told the investigators he made the jellyfish by mixing three chemicals - alginic acid, ammonium alum and calcium chloride anhydrous - according to an official release (in Chinese) by Huzhou police on social media platform WeChat. Officers say they found ""excessive levels"" of aluminium in the fake jellyfish - up to 800mg/kg, which is eight times of China's own legal limit. The food and drug safety branch of Huzhou police said too much aluminium could result in bone and nerve damage, and potentially harm memory. They warned against pregnant women, children and the elderly consuming the substance. Why make fake jellyfish? Although jellyfish can be poisonous they are considered something of a delicacy in China, described as both tasty and a good source of collagen. Especially popular in the summer, jellyfish skin is sliced and served like a salad with various dressings. It appears as if the wild jellyfish supply simply cannot cope with the demand. Zhejiang's Metropolitan Express paper has reported on jellyfish farms in the province. It quotes fish farmers saying that half-a-kilo of jellyfish takes 40 days to raise, with the wholesale price at about 30-40 yuan. This cost is halved with artificial jellyfish and for obvious reasons, the production time is far less. How do you tell real from fake jellyfish? The Huzhou police have issued guidance on how to spot the difference. Artificial jellyfish is tasteless with no smell and is tough to tear and has a texture similar to sellotape. The real deal? Quite the opposite. It has a fishy smell, and is yellowish and colourful. This is not the first fake jellyfish bust In November 2014, Huzhou police, again, caught three individuals selling fake jellyfish made from a similar chemical mixture. In October 2013, police in central Hunan province broke another jellyfish syndicate. That group is said to have made 40 tonnes of fake jellyfish, and the ringleader was sentenced to six months in jail.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cahuzac scandal: Ministers publish wealth details,"The statistics were posted on a specially created website on Monday, on the orders of Mr Hollande. The move followed the scandal surrounding former Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac, who is charged with tax fraud over a secret bank account. Mr Hollande's popularity ratings have plummeted in the wake of the scandal. Each of France's 37 ministers is required to publish details of their personal finances. The list of assets includes details of bank accounts, life assurance policies, property and other expensive items such as cars, art works and antiques. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the exercise is designed to be eye-catching, and dispel some of the public disenchantment with politics that has developed in recent weeks. Two Renaults Jerome Cahuzac caused shock earlier this month when he admitted he had hidden about 600,000 euros (£509,000; $770,000) in a Swiss bank account, having repeatedly denied it. He resigned from his government position and is now being investigated for tax fraud. President Hollande has also been embarrassed by revelations that his former Socialist Party treasurer, Jean-Jacques Augier, held personal investments in two offshore companies in the Cayman Islands. The scandals have further damaged Mr Hollande's credibility among the French public. But politicians from the left as well as the right have derided the president's demand for ministers to reveal their wealth - details of which emerged in the days leading up to Monday's deadline. Health and Social Affairs Minister Marisol Touraine, said her declaration would show about 1.4 million euros (£1.2m; $1.8 million) in assets, based primarily on several properties in Paris. The junior minister for the disabled, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, said she had two apartments and a house in southern France, worth a total of 565,000 euros (£482,000; $740,000). Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti said she owned a 70-square-metre (750-square-foot) flat in Paris, adding more light-heartedly that she also possessed a David Beckham T-shirt. Housing Minister Cecile Duflot, of the Greens, revealed she owned a house worth 168,000 euros (£143,000; $219,000) and two cars - a Renault Twingo worth 1,500 (£1,200; $1,900) euros and a Renault 4L, worth 10,000 francs at the time of purchase in 2000. On his list, Industrial Renewal Minister Arnaud Montebourg declared a designer lounge chair worth about 4,000 euros (£3,400; $5,200). Mr Hollande's approval ratings were already suffering as a result of France's continuing economic problems, but have since nosedived. When he was elected less than a year ago, he promised voters a government that would promote morality and integrity in public life. In an apparent effort to regain the political initiative, Mr Hollande's government is also planning to table new laws obliging all members of parliament to declare their assets. It also has plans for a special prosecutor to focus on corruption, and tougher penalties for those found guilty of fraud.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How financial crisis in Europe affects the UK's economy,"By Sima KotechaNewsbeat reporter in Madrid Their financial crises are threatening the Euro. It matters because a financial disaster in the Eurozone would hit the UK and could damage our chances of economic recovery. Newsbeat's Sima Kotecha is in Madrid to get the views of people there and explain how Spain is struggling. The waterfall in Madrid's Puerta del Sol square glistens under the bright August sunlight. A couple of toddlers sit around the concrete structure licking huge ice creams which look almost too big for their small hands. 'Can't find work' This place means a lot to people living in the city. It symbolises democracy and it's where, in recent weeks, there have been protests against the socialist government and its handling of Spain's plummeting economy. Raquel Rodriguez sighs in the 35C (95F) heat. She's 22 and tells Newsbeat she's in desperate need of a job. ""To find work here in Spain now, it's very difficult,"" she said. ""I studied tourism and I can't find work in restaurants or cafes. It's difficult. ""I have friends who go to Germany and London to find jobs because here it's impossible."" Unemployment is higher in Spain than anywhere else in Europe, according to the European Union's Statistics Office (Eurostat). Around 4 million people don't have work but the government says claims for unemployment benefit have fallen by 1% in the last month. Further stats show the youth are severely affected with 45% of 15 to 24-year-olds in Spain without a job. Slow growth Economists say it could get worse with more budget cuts likely to be on the horizon meaning less work. Christina is 17 years old and both her parents are unemployed. She's still a student at a school in the city but her vision of her future is bleak. ""It's everyone's fault,"" she said. ""The government, the people. The monetary system is badly organised. ""Maybe France and Germany can help but they're in the same situation."" Spain's economy is in bad shape. Even though it's the fourth largest in the EU, it's growing very slowly. The government has severe levels of debt and the high unemployment rate gives people little hope for what lies ahead. The political climate is also grim with an unpopular prime minister accused of corruption and bad financial tactics. He's being pushed to call a general election in November but some say the other candidates standing against him are no better. The Spanish government says it's tackling the country's problems by restructuring banking, pensions and employment laws. It's not all gloomy news. This week saw the European Central Bank buy some of Spain's debt. It's hoping this will raise confidence among investors and give more time to other members of the Eurozone to sort out a long-term solution to support the rest of the continent.

Czech Republic profile - Leaders,"Former Prime Minister Milos Zeman won the first direct Czech presidential election in January 2013 as the candidate of his own small centre-left grouping, the Party of Civic Rights. Like his predecessor, Vaclav Klaus, Mr Zeman thrives on confrontation and has not hesitated to exercise his presidential authority, even when this has meant entering into conflict with the Czech government. After a long political career - including his stint as a prime minister in 1998-2002 - Mr Zeman quit the Social Democratic and effectively retired from politics in 2003 in response to his loss to Vaclav Klaus Klaus in the presidential election. Political analysts attributed his 2013 comeback to his harnessing of discontent among older and poorer voters with the Necas government's handling of the economic downturn. But he is less popular with younger and better educated Czechs, who regard his election and subsequent performance with some dismay. Mr Zeman is a divisive figure, especially on account of his tendency to express his views - which are often at variance with government policy - in colourfully trenchant terms. He has irked many people - both within the country and among the Czech Republic's western allies - by defending Russia's stance on Ukraine and by voicing opposition to the western sanctions against Russia. In November 2015, Mr Zeman marked the twenty-sixth anniversary of the 1989 revolution by sharing a platform with an anti-Islamic group. Prime Minister: Bohuslav Sobotka Social Democratic party leader Bohuslav Sobotka became prime minister after a 2013 snap election triggered by the fall of the centre-right government of Petr Necas over a spying, sex and bribery scandal earlier in the year. After Necas's ouster, President Milos Zeman initially appointed a former aide, Jiri Rusnok, to head a government of experts, but the administration was deeply resented by the main political parties, and MPs withdrew their confidence and voted to go to the polls. The Social Democrats emerged as the largest party in parliament, but without a majority, and formed a coalition with the pro-business ANO party and the Christian Democrats. On his appointment, Mr Sobotka pledged to end the political gridlock that had paralysed policy making for seven months and revive economic growth following the country's longest recession on record. He promised to boost the economy by reversing the former centre-right government's austerity measures. Mr Sobotka also expressed a desire to see the Czech Republic play a fuller role in EU politics, after the euro-sceptic course pursued by centre-right governments for most of the previous decade. He has been much more supportive of the EU line on Ukraine than President Zeman. Although initial reservations about the sanctions against Russia, he eventually backed them. A trained lawyer, Mr Sobotka has been a member of parliament since 1996 and served as finance minister in 2002-6. He joined the Social Democrats in 1989 and has led the party since 2011.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Minister rules out vaccine passports in UK,"The Greek prime minister has said he would welcome British holidaymakers if they could prove they have been vaccinated. Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that people could get evidence from their GP. Labour says vaccine passports may be necessary. The possibility of giving people ""vaccine passports"" to allow a return to international travel is being debated in the UK and elsewhere. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Greek leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis are among those calling for their introduction. In the UK, more than 11m people have been vaccinated against coronavirus so far. Mr Zahawi had previously said that the government was ""looking at the technology"" to create vaccine passports, leading to accusations from critics that civil liberties would be infringed. But speaking on the Marr show, Mr Zahawi insisted that was not the plan. He said there were several reasons why vaccine passports would not be introduced, not least because the vaccine was not mandatory in the UK. ""That's not how we do things. We do them by consent,"" he said. Mr Zahawi said vaccine passports would be ""discriminatory"" and it wasn't clear what impact they would have on transmission of the virus. He said people could talk to their doctor if they needed written evidence to travel. ""Of course you have the evidence that you have been vaccinated held by your GP and if other countries require you to show proof of that evidence then that is up to those countries,"" he said. The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said vaccine passports ""may be necessary"" but he was more concerned with getting a comprehensive quarantine programme in place for arrivals in to the UK. Mr Miliband added: ""We should be open to this but there are complications to do this vaccine passport. Is it just for international travel? Is it for as you go about your business in your society?"" He said ""We are five or six weeks on from the South African variant being discovered. ""We still don't have a quarantine system in place. We still don't have a plan for a comprehensive quarantine system, so let's proceed a step at a time, and of course, look at the vaccine passport - but let's get the quarantine right and let's get the rollout right too.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trade talks 'must include healthcare',"By Hugh PymBBC health editor The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks, known as TTIP, are currently being negotiated. Campaigners say any deal which allows US health firms to compete more freely in the UK will undermine the NHS. But Earl Howe says exempting health would not be in the interest of British pharmaceutical firms, which currently face trade barriers in the US. TTIP aims at removing trade barriers in a wide range of economic sectors to make it easier to buy and sell goods and services between the EU and the US. Supporters argue a deal will boost growth and job creation in the UK and the rest of the European Union. And they say removing trade barriers will allow British exporters of goods and services to expand sales in the American market. 'Bad news' Earl Howe told the BBC it would not be in the interest of British pharmaceutical and medical technology companies, currently subject to trade barriers, to seek an exemption for health in the talks between European and America negotiators. ""The potential for them is immense - it would be highly unwise and detrimental in our view to exclude health,"" he said. Opponents of TTIP say that it is a vehicle for boosting multinational corporations' profits and that it will not help workers in Europe. There have been accusations of a lack of transparency and accountability. Protests and demonstrations have been mounted. Campaigning group 38 Degrees has been leafleting on the streets of the UK claiming that there is a threat to the health service. David Babbs, the group's executive director, argues that a trade deal ""would open up Britain to the US health industry and how could letting US health giants in be anything but bad news for our National Health Service"". This week there was a call at the TUC Congress for the government to seek a formal exemption for the NHS from the trade talks. Argument 'abused' Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of Unite, argued that trade liberalisation could pave for the way for legal challenges over NHS contracts by US health companies. She said: ""The government had no mandate to privatise our health service anyway - they certainly don't have a mandate to make it irreversible. We say to Cameron, use your veto."" Earl Howe said there had been ""scaremongering"" about the agreement and the government was not planning wholesale privatisation of the health service. EU Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht, leading the European negotiating team, has denied there is a hidden agenda and that the NHS might be undermined. He said: ""Public services are always exempted - there is no problem about exemption. The argument is abused in your country for political reasons but it has no grounds."" However, as the newly appointed European commissioners are yet to take up their posts and mid-term congressional elections in the US, a TTIP deal is not likely in the near future.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Loughborough University student died from drugs mix,"Ryan Winkler, 21, was at Echoes nightclub, in Loughborough, when he reacted to the drugs in the early hours of 21 June 2019. His parents said their son was ""smart and sensible"". Assistant coroner Tanyka Rawdon concluded the combined effects of the drugs led to a cardiac arrest and subsequent death. Mr Winkler, from Folkestone, Kent, was a second-year human biology student at Loughborough University. His girlfriend Rebecca Law told Loughborough Coroner's Court they had taken drugs before leaving home, then ketamine in an alleyway and two doses of MDMA while out. ""This was a small amount compared to what we had done before,"" she said. Ms Law said the nightclub was ""really, really hot and packed"" and, at 02:11 BST, she noticed a change in her boyfriend. ""Ryan wasn't smiling. His face was frozen,"" she added. ""I was trying to talk to him but I was not getting much out of him."" Mr Winkler was treated in a first aid room by medic Nash Gooderham. He described Mr Winkler as semi-conscious, very sweaty, and ""very stiff"". Mr Gooderham said he ""did everything"" but said if event organisers DBE had provided a radio he could have responded quicker. Mr Winkler was pronounced dead at Leicester Royal Infirmary shortly after 03:30 BST. A pathologist confirmed he died as a result of multiple drug toxicity. 'Part of scene' His father Trevor Winkler said his son's drug-taking came as a ""shock"". ""When he lived at home, he didn't go out partying. He didn't come home drunk... he was very smart and very sensible,"" he said. ""It just seems they liked that music and [taking drugs] was a part of that scene."" Ms Rawden said she was ""extremely concerned"" Mr Gooderham was left without access to a radio and added she would write to organisers DBE. ""Whilst I don't think it would have changed things for Ryan, it could change something for someone in the future,"" she added. DBE have been contacted for a response. A Loughborough University spokeswoman said it ""frequently"" reminded students of the dangers of taking drugs. ""Our sincere kind thoughts go out to Ryan's family and friends,"" she added.

Brexit: Lady Hermon expects to meet PM over deal,"By Gareth GordonBBC News NI Political Correspondent The Independent Unionist MP said she needed personal assurances from Mrs May before she would vote for the EU withdrawal agreement in the Commons. Lady Hermon told BBC News NI she was ""not happy with everything"" in the deal but there was no time for alternatives. She added that having no deal at all would be more damaging for unionism. The North Down MP, speaking to the Inside Politics programme, described the prime minister as a ""committed unionist"" and said she did not believe she would strike a deal that risked Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom. However she added: ""There are things I need clarification from the prime minister herself. I need her to look me in the face and say 'don't be worried about that' or 'I can guarantee this'. ""I need assurances from the prime minister before I will finally give my vote to this particular deal. ""However, I would be very surprised if I were ever to find myself on the same page as Sammy Wilson and Jacob Rees-Mogg."" Lady Hermon said ""every vote will count"" when MPs give their verdict on the agreement and confirmed she was ""in discussions"" with Mrs May about setting up a meeting. 'Extremely upsetting' The MP also rebuked the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) over their response to the draft Brexit deal and called on them to ""tone down"" their rhetoric. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds had criticised Mrs May's deal on Thursday, claiming it would make the UK a ""vassal"" state and lead to the break up the union, while DUP MP Sammy Wilson compared the agreement to a ""punishment beating"". The DUP is unhappy about the border backstop, an insurance clause to protect an open border on the island of Ireland, which if enforced, would see Northern Ireland more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market that other parts of the UK. But Lady Hermon said she believed that no deal would automatically lead to a hard border on the island, which would be exploited by republicans to push for a referendum on Irish unity. ""I have to say I have found language being used by senior members of the DUP extremely upsetting and concerning and I think they just have to think of the implications of what they are saying,"" Lady Hermon said. ""Words like vassal state, words like betrayal are very upsetting, they're very dispiriting and they cause great concern right across Northern Ireland."" She told the DUP that they should remember the prime minister's commitment to British unionism. ""Theresa May is not going to jeopardise the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, that is just not in her make up at all,"" the MP added. Lady Hermon voted remain in the Brexit referendum but said there was not enough parliamentary time left to strike a new deal, or hold a second referendum.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lowest ever winter deaths recorded,"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website An estimated 18,200 excess winter deaths occurred in 2013-14, the lowest number since records began in 1950-51. Last winter was notably warmer than in previous years and had a relatively mild flu season which contributed to the lower number of deaths. The Office for National Statistics data compares deaths in winter months with averages in other seasons. It showed 11.6% more people died last winter and elderly people were disproportionately affected. Of the 18,200 excess deaths, 14,000 were in the over-75s. Mild Temperatures were 2C above average for December and January last year. The ONS report said: ""The peak in mortality for 2013-14 was much less pronounced than in previous years with 8% fewer mean [average] daily deaths during December and January compared to the five year average."" While excess winter deaths are linked to low temperatures, hypothermia is not the main cause. Experience shows that the majority of such deaths are due to heart disease, stroke and respiratory illness. However, the flu season was mild and the type of flu virus circulating last winter had a bigger impact on young adults than elderly people. ""The combination of mild winter temperatures and circulation of a subtype of influenza virus which predominantly impacts on young adults rather than the elderly may partly explain the low levels of excess winter mortality in 2013-14,"" the report said. Met Office predictions suggest this winter is likely to be relatively mild as well. Historical trend In 1950-51, an estimated 106,400 excess winter deaths were recorded, but the figures were closer to 60,000 for most of that decade. There has been a consistent decline since then with deaths averaging around 50,000 in the 70s and 40,000 in the 80s. Despite improvements, the UK tends to have higher winter mortality figures than colder countries such as Germany and Finland. It is thought that people who live in countries with relatively mild winters have less insulated homes and are less likely to wear warm gear in cold weather. Commenting on the report, Age UK's Caroline Abrahams, said: ""It is truly shocking that thousands of older people are dying unnecessarily every winter because they cannot afford to keep warm. ""This is a national disgrace and a damning indictment of our failure to tackle the root cause of the problem: cold, energy-inefficient homes. ""Fewer older people died last year compared to recent years, but the winter was exceptionally mild: we must not be complacent about the cold homes which cause so many deaths among older people because who knows how bad this and future winters will be."" She called on the government to ""bring all our housing up to a high energy efficiency standard"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Plaid Cymru wants pro-remain parties to work together,"Adam Price has written to the Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Change UK and the SNP. He said they should work together for ""as long as necessary"" to deliver another vote on EU membership. His call comes after the Brexit Party took two Welsh seats in the recent EU elections. Plaid Cymru and Labour each took one of the country's four MEP seats in Brussels. Despite the Brexit Party's victory, Mr Price said the combined total votes given to anti-Brexit parties shows that Brexit ""cannot be considered the settled will of the people"". The Brexit Party gained 32.5% of the vote in Wales with UKIP taking 3.3% while Plaid Cymru received 19.6%, the Liberal Democrats 13.6%, Green Party 6.3% and Change UK 2.9%. ""With the Brexit Party having won the highest number of seats, there is now a grave risk that the result will be used to justify a no-deal Brexit,"" Mr Price said. ""I am particularly concerned that it will be used to influence the candidates running to become the next leader of the Conservative Party."" He described an ""urgent need"" for the parties to work together to ""ensure that all the nations of these islands are not dragged headfirst towards a no deal Brexit for which there is no mandate"". Mr Price added: ""We are passionately pro-European parties who believe that our nations' rightful place is at the heart of Europe. ""We must not let the politics of the Brexit Party divide us as we seek to maintain our nations' place in Europe."" Mr Price invited fellow leaders to meet him for an ""initial, exploratory"" discussion. A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said the party was always happy to discuss ways of achieving ""our common aims"". He added: ""Since June 2016, Liberal Democrats have led efforts in Parliament to secure a people's vote, and this has included work with other parties with varying degrees of success.

Amazon told to answer Deliveroo deal concerns in five days,"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was worried the tie-up could increase delivery prices. The regulator gave the two firms five days to address its concerns about competition in the food delivery space. If they fail to impress the watchdog, the $575m (£437m) deal could ultimately be blocked. The CMA said that the investment may prevent Amazon from launching its own food delivery operation, a move which could reduce prices for customers in the future. ""Millions of people in the UK use online food platforms for takeaways, and more than ever are making use of similar services for the same-day delivery of groceries,"" said Andrea Gomes da Silva, executive director of the CMA. ""There are relatively few players in these markets, so we're concerned that Amazon having this kind of influence over Deliveroo could dampen the emerging competition between the two businesses."" She said that if the deal were to go ahead in its current form then there was a ""real risk"" that customers, restaurants and grocers would face higher prices and lower quality services. In a statement, Deliveroo said it was confident it could persuade the CMA that Amazon's investment would ""add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers"". Amazon said the investment would help Deliveroo develop new products and remain competitive. It is not the first time Amazon has tried to enter the food delivery market in the UK. The online retailer briefly ran its own delivery venture, Amazon Restaurants UK, which it started in 2016 but closed just two years later. It was previously reported to have made approaches to buy Deliveroo outright. Uber also reportedly had talks with Deliveroo regarding an interest in buying it. Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu came up with the idea for the firm after he moved from New York to London as a banking analyst. He was working long hours and was frustrated by the fact so few restaurants delivered, a service widely available in the US. In the firm's early days, Mr Shu delivered all the food himself on a motorbike, while Greg Orlowski, his co-founder who has since left the business, developed the booking technology from his home in the US. Mr Shu still claims to get on his bike once a week to deliver an order to customers in London, as a way of staying in touch with riders. Deliveroo has grown quickly - last year it doubled the number of towns and cities it operates in, helping sales to surge by 72%. However, losses deepened to £232m in 2018, from £199m a year earlier as the company splashed out £18m on technology and £10m on free insurance for its riders. Sales grew to £476m in the year to December 2018, up from £277m in 2017. Deliveroo operates in 11 markets outside the UK including Australia, France, Germany and Hong Kong.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China quake: Rescue teams blast roads amid aftershocks,"Rescue workers are using dynamite and heavy equipment to get through roads blocked by landslides to reach remote areas, reports say. But reaching these areas has been a struggle, with bad weather and powerful aftershocks contributing to delays. At least 188 people are known to have died in the quake, says state media. More than 11,500 others have also been reported injured since the 6.6 magnitude quake struck at 08:02 local time (00:02 GMT). More than 18,000 soldiers and police have been mobilised in the rescue efforts, state news agency Xinhua said on Sunday. Twenty-three helicopters from the armed forces were also being deployed to help out in the operations, Xinhua said on Sunday, quoting an official statement. Seeking relief Some of those who have been made homeless are complaining that they have not yet received food or water, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Sichuan province. Rescue teams had already reached the remote villages in mountainous Baoxing County on foot, but landslides were blocking access to aid trucks and preventing some of the casualties from being brought out. Even in the more accessible areas of neighbouring Lushan county, the aid effort has been hampered by road congestion, our correspondent adds. Officials have set up an outdoors hospital in Ya-an, the city closest to the epicentre. ""The biggest problem is that the worst-hit spots are spread out in the mountains and it is very hard for rescuers to get the injured people out,"" said Zhou Shaohua, chief surgeon at the People's Hospital of Lushan. ""It takes hours for them to be able to reach a place where they can catch a vehicle."" ""I dare not go anywhere near a mountainside,"" a woman named Zhu was quoted by Agence-France Presse news agency, in the village of Baoxing, centre of Lushan county, as saying. ""Many people are worried that the rain will bring more devastation."" Correspondents say the hill villages, where farmers grow rice, vegetables and corn on terraced plots, were hit the hardest by the earthquake. Sichuan province was also devastated by a massive quake five years ago that claimed tens of thousands of lives and left five million without homes. Many of the collapsed buildings were schools and nurseries, leading to widespread criticism of local government's planning policies. Although on the same fault line, this earthquake was much less powerful than the previous one. Once again, though, it is the poor who have born the brunt of the disaster, with the biggest killer not the earthquake itself but poorly-constructed houses, our correspondent adds.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Spalding shooting: Three members of family killed,"The BBC understands Lance Hart, 57, his wife Claire Hart, 50, and their daughter Charlotte Hart, 19, were killed in the shooting in Spalding. Lincolnshire Police had earlier said the suspected gunman was among the dead and said they were not looking for anyone else over the incident. Police said they believed a shotgun was used. The shooting happened near the Castle Swimming Pool in Pinchbeck Road at about 09:00 BST. Latest updates on shooting in Spalding Police also searched a house in the village of Moulton, five miles (8km) from the centre of Spalding. Speaking on BBC Radio Lincolnshire, the leader of South Holland District Council said he had been told it was believed to be a ""domestic incident"". ""This looks by all accounts to be a very tragic family incident"", Councillor Gary Porter said. East Midlands Ambulance Service said paramedics were told to approach the scene with caution and fought to save the three people, who had gunshot wounds. The air ambulance was also called to the swimming pool. ""Despite the best efforts of everyone at the scene the patients were pronounced dead"", an ambulance spokesperson said. Any witnesses have been asked to contact police. The leisure centre said it had closed because of the shooting. Lincolnshire County Council said pupils were being kept inside local schools for safety, but the lockdown had since been lifted.

#BBCtrending: The women in Iran taking off the hijab,"By BBC Trending What's popular and why The Facebook page was set up just over a week ago, and already has 130,000 ""likes"". Almost all are from people in Iran, both men and women. So far the page has around 150 photos. They show women on the beach, on the street, in the countryside, alone, with friends or their partners - but crucially - all without the headscarf. Most include a few words, for example: ""I loathe the hijab. I too like the feel of the sun and the wind on my hair. Is this a big sin?"" Ever since the Islamic Revolution 35 years ago, it has been illegal for a woman to leave the house without wearing a headscarf. The punishment ranges from a fine to imprisonment. ""My hair was like a hostage to the government,"" says Masih Alinejad, an Iranian political journalist who lives in the UK and who set up the Facebook page. ""The government still has a lot of hostages,"" she adds. Alinejad got the idea after she posted some photos of herself without the hijab to her own Facebook page. The images were liked thousands of times. So many women began to send her their own pictures that she decided to set up a dedicated page. Though she's well-known for being critical of the government in Iran, she insists the page is not political. ""These are not women activists, but just ordinary women talking from their hearts."" ""My problem is not having to wear the headscarf. My problem is not having a choice,"" writes one woman on the Facebook page. ""Stealthy freedom means, just for a few seconds, I will be what I want to be,"" writes another. The hijab is a controversial issue in Iran. A recent billboard campaign reminding women to cover themselves up, was mocked on social media for comparing women to chocolates in a wrapper. But many support the wearing of the hijab, arguing it's an important part of Islamic law - there was a demonstration in Tehran last week, with protesters calling for a more strict implementation of the rules.

Royal Ballet 'in shock' as dancer Sergei Polunin quits,"In a statement, Royal Ballet director Dame Monica Mason admitted his decision had been a ""huge shock"". Polunin joined the ballet in 2007 and was promoted to principal at the end of the 2009-10 season, aged just 19. He had been due to appear in The Dream next week, but has stepped down from his role with immediate effect. Arrangements are now being put in place so the show can still premiere on 1 February. It is likely that Steven McRae, a Sydney-born dancer who has been with the Royal Ballet since 2004, will replace him. In a statement, Dame Monica said: ""This has obviously come as a huge shock. Sergei is a wonderful dancer and I have enjoyed watching him tremendously, both on stage and in the studio, over the past few years. ""I wish him every success in the future."" Polunin commented on his decision on Twitter, saying: ""Just have to go through one night!!! then will make my next moves."" He also updated his biography to say: ""Principal Dancer of ?"" On New Year's Eve he posted the comment: ""2012 it's going to be controversial."" Five days later, he added: ""Who wants to live forever anyway??? really."" Despite his resignation, he is still expected to dance in Ivan Putrov's Men in Motion, which opens at Sadler's Wells on Friday. A spokeswoman for the London dance house said in a statement: ""I am pleased to confirm that Sergei is still performing in Ivan's Men in Motion this weekend. His resignation from the Royal Ballet is not in connection with the show."" Strict regime A bout of pneumonia as a child helped Polunin decide to become a dancer. In an interview with the Independent newspaper last November, he explained how he gave up gymnastics for ballet because the dusty halls had affected his health. ""I'd always been one of the best in my gymnastics school, so I transferred to trying to be the best dancer, without knowing anything about ballet,"" he said. He also revealed that he struggled to follow the strict diet and exercise regimes that professional dancers adhere to. ""I'm not good. I don't do many classes. Sometimes I don't eat all day, then have four meals between 8pm and 4am. I go to bed really late - if I just sleep I won't have a life outside ballet.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The spying game: China's global network,"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent So how extensive is it, how does it work and who runs it? A dossier reportedly compiled with the help of a former MI6 spy has accused China of trying to manipulate key UK figures, including politicians, to back the telecom giant's business in Britain. Every major Chinese enterprise anywhere in the world allegedly has an internal ""cell"" answerable to the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to drive the political agenda and ensure that the company is compliant with political directives. This is why China experts assert that the CCP does operate here in Britain, often under the natural cover of business. ""The Party machine is everywhere"", says one, adding: ""For China, business is inseparable from politics."" The CCP has 93 million members, with many of them placed or hidden in organisations abroad. This allows them to be tasked with gathering secrets, especially in the technology sphere, including telecoms. Experts say these ""agents"", as well as targeted individuals in important positions in foreign companies, can be recruited or persuaded using a number of different methods. Setting honeytraps The first approach is usually what is known as ""a positive incentive"", especially if the targeted individual is a non-Chinese national. In the West this can take the form of a tempting invitation to an important business meeting in China, an offer of financial help for a company facing difficulties, or the offer of a (sometimes meaningless) seat on a board as a non-executive director or even in some cases a life-changing sum of money. In the last 10 to 15 years there has been an increasing readiness to target well-placed foreigners with positive incentives. Inside China though, recruitment methods can, according to people familiar with them, take on a far more sinister form. This can include putting pressure on Chinese family members - essentially blackmail - to honeytraps set for unwary western businessmen. This usually entails a ""chance"" encounter with an attractive woman which is then covertly recorded and used as ""kompromat"" - compromising material to be used as a lever. ""The Chinese state is very good at setting honeytraps on their own territory,"" says a British businessman who has worked in China. These are normally run by China's Ministry of State Security. Rather than being run centrally, these targeting operations tend to be run out of provincial State Security bureau, each of which deals with a different geographic area of the world. So the Shanghai bureau, for example, covers the US, Beijing covers Russia and the former Soviet republics, Tianjin covers Japan and Korea, and so on. ""The Chinese state uses the full spectrum of government levers to acquire information,"" says someone very familiar with its operations. ""This ranges from targeted and large-scale cyber espionage and theft to co-opting industry experts, both knowingly and unknowingly."" ""Along with Russia,"" he adds, ""China is the biggest espionage threat to the UK"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Egypt arrests: UN condemns detention of human rights advocates,"Targeting activists was having a ""profound chilling effect on an already weakened... civil society"", it said. The head of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, Gasser Abdel-Razek, was detained on Thursday, days after two colleagues. They are being held for suspected links with a terror group. Dozens of activists have been arrested under President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. But Egypt has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights violations. Mr Sisi led the military's overthrow of his democratically elected predecessor Mohammed Morsi in 2013 following protests against his rule. 'Co-ordinated response' The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) is an independent group whose work covers a variety of political, civil, economic and social issues. It said in a statement on Friday that on the previous day security forces had arrested Mr Abdel Razek from his home in Maadi, south of Cairo, and taken him to an unknown location. It said that its director of criminal justice, Karim Ennarah, was arrested on Wednesday in Dahab and its office manager, Mohammed Basheer, was detained in Cairo on Sunday. Both men had been detained pending investigations, it said, adding that they faced charges including joining a terrorist group. The EIPR described the arrests as a ""clear and co-ordinated response"" to its work, which includes monitoring places of detention and the issuance of death sentences. It said Mr Abdel-Razek's arrest was ""an attempt to put an end to organised and legitimate human rights work in Egypt"". Meanwhile Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the arrests were feared to be part of a broader pattern of intimidation and silencing dissent. ""The use of sweeping counter-terrorism laws and vague charges such as 'joining a terrorist organization' and 'spreading false information' to harass and criminalise the work of human rights defenders is inconsistent with the rule of law and Egypt's obligations under international human rights law,"" she said. ""We are very concerned that the targeting of human rights defenders and other activists, as well as further restrictions on freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly imposed in the country, are having a profound chilling effect on an already weakened Egyptian civil society."" France expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest of Mr Basheer on Tuesday, and stressed that it maintained ""a frank, exacting dialogue with Egypt on human rights issues"". The Egyptian foreign ministry on Wednesday rejected France's ""interference in an Egyptian internal affair"". It also stressed that Egypt respected the rule of law and equality before it.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Paddy Armstrong in offer to help Guildford Four inquest,"In a submission, he told Surrey Coroner Richard Travers his involvement could help the families of those who died get to the truth of what happened. His application was opposed by two police forces, the Ministry of Defence and the family of victim Ann Hamilton. Five people were killed and a further 65 were injured when the IRA blew up two pubs in 1974. The Guildford Four served 15 years in jail in what became one of Britain's biggest miscarriages of justice. In his submission to a pre-inquest review, Mr Armstrong claimed important evidence gathered by police after the bombings had been ""nothing but a work of fiction"" and ""guesswork"", and said he could comment on the credibility of the evidence. He said he wanted the truth for himself and the families of those who died. Henrietta Hill QC, representing Mr Armstrong, said issues to be explored by the inquest - including the times, locations and who was with the victims - were all part of the criminal trial against her client. She said Mr Armstrong could offer ""significant assistance"" to the inquiry. However Oliver Sanders QC, counsel to the inquest, said the prosecution case against the Guildford Four rested entirely on their confessions and did not explore events that night. Beatrice Collier, for Surrey Police, said Mr Armstrong seemed to envisage himself as a ""quasi-expert witness"", but told Mr Travers: ""If he were to take that role it would risk usurping your own."" James Berry, for the Met, said Mr Armstrong had no knowledge of any of the matters within the inquest scope and no connection to anyone who died, while Edward Pleeth, for the Ministry of Defence, said: ""He had no real-time involvement with the bombings whatsoever."" Christopher Stanley, from KRW Law, solicitor for the Hamilton family, said: ""The deceased should be at the heart of the inquest process."" Appearing without counsel, he said the family had not been at the heart of any investigation into the Guildford pub bombings for 46 years. Ms Hamilton died alongside Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17, in the first blast at the Horse and Groom on 5 October, along with 21-year-old plasterer Paul Craig. Mr Stanley also told the inquest the Hamiltons had approached the Legal Aid Agency, Home Office, Ministry of Defence, Cabinet Office for Veteran Affairs, and Royal British Legion for legal funding, without success, while social media and crowdfunding appeals could not be relied on. He said: ""It's important to have it on the record that it's a very sad and sorry state of affairs."" Mr Travers said he would rule on Mr Armstrong's application by the end of November.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
RNLI 'float' advice after 18 deaths off Welsh coast,"There were 18 deaths in Wales in 2018, according to the RNLI's annual coastal fatality figures, up from an average of 15 deaths annually since 2014. Its annual safety message urges people to ""fight your instinct"" to swim hard and ""relax and float on your back"". Parents of Jude Rees, 10, believe it saved him off the Gower coast in 2018. Confident swimmer Jude, then aged nine, and his family were at Blue Pool Bay when he was caught by a strong current which pulled him away from the shore where he had been paddling in August. Paul and Clair tried desperately to help their son, along with one of Jude's older brothers, as others rang the coastguard. Experienced sea swimmer Ceri Saunders was walking nearby and dived into the sea to reach Jude. But as she was unable to tow him to shore against the current, she advised Jude to relax and float on his back. ""There are no words to say how grateful [we] are for what Ceri did for our son and our family,"" said Mrs Rees. ""It was amazing. Ceri told him to swim on his back. He did exactly as he was told even though he was dragged out further."" Jude's dad said he had ""no doubt that the advice helped to save him that day"". Ms Saunders said it was a ""frightening"" experience but she remembered a life-saving course she completed years ago that told her ""the best chance of survival"" was to float on your back. ""Thankfully, Jude followed instructions and it was a successful end to the story,"" she said. The RNLI's Respect the Water drowning prevention campaign advises: The pair were rescued by volunteers from the RNLI Burry Port lifeboat station. The RNLI said the spike in deaths last year, compared with eight in 2017, could be attributed to the prolonged hot weather. Men accounted for all but one of the deaths - 39% were aged 36-50 and 28% were 19-35. Chris Cousens from the RNLI said: ""Many of the tragic deaths at the coast can be avoided if people understand the risks and prepare themselves by practising the float technique.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hong Kong: 'Secession' arrests after Chinese University protest,"Three were detained on suspicion of inciting secession, which can carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. In recent weeks activists have been jailed or detained under the new law, legislation human rights groups say amounts to ""repression"". The US on Monday sanctioned 14 more Chinese officials over the clampdown. The Treasury Department froze the assets and restricted the travel of 14 vice-chairs of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which passed the National Security Law for Hong Kong. In August, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was among 10 officials from the territory and the mainland put under such sanctions. She later said she had to keep ""piles of cash"" at home as she had no bank account. China and Hong Kong say the security law was needed to restore stability after chaotic pro-democracy protests but some Western nations, including the UK, say it has undermined the terms agreed ahead of the return of the territory's sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997. Who has been arrested? Three students were reportedly among the eight people detained in a police operation on Monday. The eight, aged between 16 and 34, were accused of taking part in an unauthorised assembly. Police told the South China Morning Post the three students had been detained on suspicion of inciting secession. Five of the detainees, the Post said, are either graduates or alumni of Chinese University, including three district council politicians. What happened at the university? Just under 100 graduating students and others, some with black robes and balloons and wearing masks, protested peacefully at Chinese University campus last month. Some shouted slogans similar to those used in protests last year but which now are illegal. Police checked video footage the next day, reportedly with the agreement of the university's management. The student union condemned the management's decision as an ""outrage"" that had destroyed trust with students. Amnesty International accused Hong Kong authorities of carrying out a ""sweeping repression"" in educational institutions. What's the background? Dozens of people have been arrested under the National Security Law since it came into effect on 30 June. The legislation introduced new crimes, including conspiring with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or the Hong Kong authorities. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fear for their safety. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle, which was supposed to guarantee certain freedoms for the territory for 50 years. Critics of Hong Kong's government say those freedoms have now been eroded.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Article 50 would 'change devolution', Welsh Government says","By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales political correspondent The UK government is appealing against a High Court ruling that Theresa May must consult Parliament over the process to leave the European Union. The Welsh Government has now set out its objections to the Supreme Court. Counsel General Mick Antoniw said a ""constitutional principle"" is at stake. The UK government claims the prime minister can invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to launch the formal two-year process of leaving the European Union using crown prerogative. But Welsh ministers have objected, claiming the same method could be used to undermine devolution unless the appeal fails. In its submission to the Supreme Court ahead of the hearing next month, the Welsh Government claims that a large number of its devolved functions derive from EU law and will ""therefore be lost upon the UK's withdrawal from the EU Treaties"". The Welsh Government's top legal advisor Mr Antoniw set out two main reasons why Theresa May cannot use so-called ""prerogative powers"" to begin the process without the consent of Parliament. The Pontypridd AM says the two-year process of withdrawing from the EU would ""modify the competence of the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government"" is such a way that requires the approval of MPs. He also said the UK government would have to ""short-circuit"" a convention whereby ministers in Westminster may not legislate for devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislature. In their verdict last month, three High Court judges ruled that triggering Article 50 would fundamentally change UK people's rights - and the government cannot change or do away with rights under UK law unless Parliament gives it authority to do so. In his case, Mick Antoniw goes a step further by arguing that the powers transferred from Parliament to the assembly use ""primary legislation"" which cannot be altered without the permission of MPs. ""The constitutional principle at stake is wider and does not permit the prerogative to dispense with primary legislation,"" he says. ""It is not confined to legislation that affects individual rights. It operates to prevent the prerogative from being used so as to have the effect of altering the competence of the Welsh Assembly and Welsh ministers."" In its submission to the Supreme Court the UK Government says: ""Under the UK's constitution, it is for the Government to exercise prerogative powers to conduct the UK's affairs on the international plane. That is a vital part of the conduct of modern inter-state business and is entirely consistent with the sovereignty of Parliament"". A UK government spokesman said: ""We have received the arguments set out by the Scottish and Welsh governments and will set out our arguments in due course. ""It would not be appropriate to comment further before then.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
MP Elfyn Llwyd criticises care for military veterans,"Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said an opportunity had been ""badly missed"". Last year David Cameron said the covenant - a promise of a duty of care - could become law. But critics say a proposed annual report on the covenant in the Armed Forces Bill is a U-turn. Mr Llwyd, Plaid Cymru's leader at Westminster, plans to table a series of amendments to the bill. Continued failure? ""It is politicians who place these brave troops in harm's way. We owe them a duty to ensure their wellbeing upon their return home. Anything else is a breach of the military covenant,"" he said. Mr Llwyd said he had been excluded from committee stage of the bill, saying it ""smacks of a stitch-up - in the same way as this toothless clause is stitching up veterans"". ""There is a mandatory duty on the government to implement the military covenant. ""The last Labour government failed pitifully in this respect and we are still seeing increasing numbers of veterans in prison - maybe as high as at one in nine of the prison population. ""This was an opportunity to put veterans' welfare at the heart of the bill - one that has been badly missed."" He added: ""I fear that this government is about to continue in this failure to our troops."" Mr Llwyd said his proposed amendments would force the government ""to show whether they are serious about implementing the military covenant"". 'Defining the covenant' The government denies it has made a U-turn since Mr Cameron last year expressed a wish to set out formal commitments on matters like education for military children and care for troops injured on the battlefield. ""I want all these things refreshed and renewed and written down in a new military covenant that's written into the law of the land,"" he said during a visit to HMS Ark Royal last June. Last week, Royal British Legion director general Chris Simpkins told a committee of MPs that troops found it ""pretty depressing"" the covenant was not included in the bill as it stands. A proposal in the bill for the defence secretary to report annually to Parliament on the state of the covenant was no substitute for enshrining the concept in law, he said. It amounted to ""the MoD reporting on itself"", Mr Simpkins added. But Armed forces minister Nick Harvey said the covenant will be defined in the bill. ""For the first time we are actually defining the covenant and what it means,"" Mr Harvey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Research by probation union Napo in 2009 suggested that 6% of prisoners, or those on probation or parole, were ex-servicemen. Napo assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said: ""The Armed Forces Bill is an excellent opportunity to introduce measures on a statutory footing to minimise the chances of former armed services personnel ending up in the criminal justice system, with mental health problems or becoming homeless.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Call for free legal help to protect rape victims' data,"The study, led by Loughborough University, surveyed 586 victims with most claiming the criminal justice process was ""insensitive and unfair"". Victims in England and Wales have no right to legal aid, although there is some access allowed in Scotland. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said only ""reasonable lines of inquiry"" should be carried out. Dr Olivia Smith, a criminology and social policy expert, said the vast majority of police officers interviewed as part of her research thought the CPS asked forces to gather excessive amounts of data from victims. This included information from GPs, schools, social services and counselling, as well as mobile phone data. One complainant, who made a report to police in 2018, said: ""I wish they told me that signing a form to give the police access to my phone meant they would be examining my consensual sexual relationships and sexual history. ""I didn't realise my relationships with my exes, how many friends I have [and] how often I go out is relevant to being raped by a school teacher."" Some complainants said they delayed counselling over fears their notes would be accessed. Others said the strain of the legal process was not worth the eventual conviction. The report was commissioned by the police and crime commissioner for Northumbria following a pilot scheme. It found a victim's experiences of the criminal justice system was improved when offered free and independent legal advocacy. 'Catastrophic failure' Dr Smith said: ""Our research shows the huge emotional cost of reporting to the police and we need to find a way to change this. ""This is about more than conviction rates. It is about dignified treatment, regardless of outcome."" Katie Russell, from Rape Crisis, said there had been a ""catastrophic failure of justice"" when it came to rape and sexual offences. She said: ""It's our experience from providing front-line support to victims and survivors that they are being pressurised into handing over vast quantities of personal data and there are question marks over how relevant much of that data is."" A spokesperson for the CPS said: ""We completely understand that how personal information is used in criminal proceedings can be a source of anxiety. ""Balancing the need to respect privacy and pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry to make sure the justice system is fair for all is an ongoing challenge. ""It is critical victims are not deterred from seeking justice as a result of these concerns. ""Our guidance is clear: complainants' and witnesses' mobile telephones should not be examined as a matter of course in every case. ""Only reasonable lines of inquiry should be pursued to avoid unnecessary intrusion into personal data."" The report is to be shared with the Criminal Justice Board, MPs and peers. A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with survivors' groups and experts, through our ongoing review, to ensure victims are given the support they need.""

Coronavirus: Living with children 'no increased risk',"By Naomi GrimleyBBC News It looked at data on nine million adults under 65 between February and August, comparing the risks to those living with and without children. Sharing a house with under-18s did not increase the risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid. A scientists who worked on the study said it showed ""no net harm in kids coming back to the house from school"". 'Learning live' The researchers, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the University of Oxford, found adults living with very young or primary-school-age children had no increased risk of Covid-19 infection or a related hospital admission. In fact, they were about 25% less likely to die of Covid-19 than people living without children, which the researchers think may be linked to healthier living habits previously identified in those who care for children. People living with secondary-school-age children had a very small (8%) increased risk of a Covid-19 infection, but no increased risk of hospitalisation.. They were 27% less likely to die from the disease, again perhaps because they tend to be healthier than adults of the same age without children. The study, which has not yet been published in a journal, looked at what happened between February and August and so straddled the period when schools were fully open as well as the time after 20 March when they were closed to all but a few children. It also spanned the summer holidays, though not the reopening of schools in September. Researchers also took into account other factors such as smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity and chronic health problems. 'No net harm' Liam Smeeth, professor of clinical epidemiology at LSHTM who worked on the study, said: ""We know that people who live with kids are generally more healthy and have a slightly lower risk of dying of anything. ""And we see a very similar pattern for bad Covid outcomes such as hospitalisation and death. So there's no net harm in kids coming back to the house from school."" He added: ""Many would agree if we can keep schools open, that's really important for this generation of young people, and this study contributes one part of that equation: that there's no net harmful effect to living with children."" Dr Ben Goldacre, director of the DataLab at the University of Oxford and who also worked on the study, said the team would continue to analyse data during the second lockdown, under which many areas of society were closed but schools remained open. ""It's important we get data insights on these policy interventions as soon as we possibly can, because the story of Covid is that we are learning 'live' as it harms people around us,"" he said. Dr David McAllister, a public health lecturer at the University of Glasgow who has carried out similar research, said this showed that ""sharing a household with school-aged children does not place the adults with whom they live at greater risk"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Queen's Speech outlines new Scottish Parliament powers,"The Queen's Speech included a pledge to implement the recommendations of the Calman review of devolution. They include new tax powers for Holyrood, as well as powers over drink-driving, speed limits and airguns. A total of 16 of the 20 bills announced at the state opening of parliament will apply in Scotland, under a programme to restore economic growth. It is thought legislation to extend the new powers to Holyrood, contained in a Scotland Bill, may be launched in the autumn. A spokesman for Scottish Secretary Danny Alexander, said: ""There's a serious intention to get on with this. ""We're moving faster than was previously envisaged but we are having engagement along the way to make sure we get a better package."" Mr Alexander added the measures in the Queen's Speech would ""deliver real benefit for Scotland"". Other areas relating to Scotland include plans for a new high speed rail network and the scrapping of ID cards. The Queen's Speech came after the Scottish government was told it would be expected to make savings of £332m, as part of UK Chancellor George Osborne's plan to save £6bn in the first wave of public spending cuts to reduce the UK's deficit. Scottish ministers have accepted an offer from the UK government to defer the cuts to support economic recovery. The Calman Commission, established with the support of Labour, Tory and Lib Dem MSPs, recommended new powers should be devolved from Westminster to Holyrood, including responsibility for raising half of Scotland's income tax. But First Minister Alex Salmond, who has called for full fiscal powers for Scotland, said the proposals had been overtaken by the UK government's plan to pay for a rise in the income tax allowance with personal increases in National Insurance, under which money would go straight to the Treasury. The Calman Commission had also recommended that the Scottish Parliament should control national speed limits, drink-driving laws and airguns legislation. SNP Westminster spokesman Angus Robertson said: ""While the legislative programme was light on detail, some of the ideas contained within it have potential to deliver improved economic decision making for Scotland. ""On financial responsibilities, we need the powers to grow the Scottish economy and to give Scottish business a competitive advantage - decisions relating to Scotland's finances should be taken in Scotland. ""This would settle the age-old disputes about funding, and allow both governments to focus on economic recovery."" Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray called on the UK government to to ensure the Calman recommendations were passed before next year's Holyrood election. He added: ""People in Scotland need to know what powers the Scottish government will have when they vote in May 2011 so there cannot be any drift now from this Tory-Lib Dem government."" The Scottish government said five bills announced in the Queen's Speech were likely to need legislative consent motions, which allow the UK government to lesiglate in areas of devolved responsibility.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Secret Service Colombia scandal prompts new rules,"Agents travelling overseas will be banned from drinking on duty, visiting ""disreputable establishments"" and bringing foreigners into hotel rooms. ""Consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks,"" Director Mark Sullivan reportedly told staff. The agency will also hold ethics sessions for staff as it attempts to move on from the Cartagena episode. Twelve Secret Service agents and several US military officers were implicated in a night of sex and drink in the Colombian port city ahead of President Barack Obama's visit for a regional summit earlier this month. All 12 agency staff have now either resigned or are facing disciplinary action. The Secret Service has also said it is investigating a report that members of another advance team visited strip clubs and paid for prostitutes in El Salvador in 2011. A spokesman said on Thursday that no ""credible"" evidence had been found to back up the report. 'Common sense' The agency described the changes as ""common-sense enhancements"" of existing rules - ""refinements of existing rules"" governing employee responsibilities and conduct. Agents deployed on foreign assignments will in future receive briefings on arrival that include ""off-limit zones and off-limit establishments"". Drinking within 10 hours of being on duty will be banned, as will allowing foreigners into hotel rooms, with the exception of hotel staff and official counterparts. At other times only ""moderate"" alcohol consumption is permitted. The 12 Secret Service agents linked to the Cartagena scandal enjoyed a night out at a well-know strip bar in the city's port area, reported to have involved large quantities of vodka. They later returned to the five-star Hotel Caribe accompanied by a clutch of Colombian women. The next morning a row over payment saw one woman fly into a rage and led to the discovery of as many as 20 women in American rooms. The Secret Service removed the men from active duty and replaced them before President Obama arrived for the Summit of the Americas, insisting that the president's safety was never compromised. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told Congress earlier this week that the incident in Colombia appeared to be an isolated case, saying she would be surprised if it represented a broader cultural problem.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ecuador curbs Assange's internet to halt US election 'interference',"It said Mr Assange had in recent weeks released material that could have an impact on the US presidential election. Ecuador also said its move was not the result of pressure from Washington. The US denied WikiLeaks accusations that it had asked Ecuador to stop the site publishing documents about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Transparency activist Julian Assange has sought asylum at London's Ecuadorean embassy since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations. 'No pressure' In a statement (in Spanish), the Ecuadorean foreign ministry said WikiLeaks' decision to publish documents could have an impact on the US presidential election. It said the release was entirely the responsibility of the organisation, and Ecuador did not want to interfere in the electoral process. ""In that respect, Ecuador, exercising its sovereign right, has temporarily restricted access to part of its communications systems in its UK Embassy,"" the statement said. It added that ""Ecuador does not yield to pressures from other countries"". WikiLeaks earlier said that Ecuador had cut off Mr Assange's internet access on Saturday evening. The site has recently been releasing material from Hillary Clinton's campaign, including those from a hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails. It released transcripts on Saturday of paid speeches Mrs Clinton made to the US investment bank Goldman Sachs in the past, which her campaign had long refused to release. The scripts reveal bantering exchanges with bank executives, which correspondents say may increase concerns among liberal Democrats that she is too cosy with Wall Street. The Democratic White House candidate's camp has claimed the cyber-breach was orchestrated by Russian hackers with the aim of undermining the US democratic process. While Mrs Clinton's team has neither confirmed nor denied the leaked emails are authentic, there have been no indications they are fake. 'Covert' Syrian action According to the latest leaked emails, Mrs Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria. She made the remark in answer to a question from Lloyd Blankfein, the bank's chief executive, in 2013 - months after she left office as secretary of state. ""My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,"" she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 (£185,000) to give a speech. Mrs Clinton - who is accused of being hawkish by liberal critics - added: ""We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves. ""They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we're doing and I want credit for it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Central Line strike: London Underground drivers in 24-hour walkout,"The Central Line was closed earlier but is now operating a limited service with severe delays. The Waterloo and City Line is suspended. People are experiencing overcrowded stations, trains and replacement buses. Union Aslef said the strike, which started at midnight, was over working conditions. LU said it was ""needless"". Transport for London (TfL) said there was a ""queuing system in place"" at Ilford, Manor Park and Forest Gate to cope with the crowds. The Central Line is currently running a ""severely delayed"" service between Ealing Broadway and White City and between Woodford and Liverpool Street. TfL said it was not yet able to confirm whether a limited service would also be running on the Central Line Night Tube. On social media, passengers have been speaking about their nightmare journeys. Lewis Allcock tweeted that his 167 bus to Ilford was ""so ancient, there was no Oyster tap system - free ride!"". Another Twitter user described the ""bizarre sight of vintage Routemasters and tourist open-tops ferrying commuters"". Aslef's Finn Brennan said the strike was over a number of issues, including ""unsafe"" working practices. ""Drivers are continually forced into overtime and unsafe new working practices are pushed through without agreement,"" he said. ""It would be a dereliction of our duty as trade unionists if we did not take action to stop our members being treated like this."" Nigel Holness, director of network operations for LU, apologised to commuters for the ""unnecessary disruption"". On the scene: Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent A misty Epping Tube station at 07:30 and lots and lots of passengers were still turning up who didn't know about the strike. The options - a shared cab or the dreaded bus replacement service to Chingford. I joined the commuters on the top deck. And so began a long, slow arduous crawl through Epping forest through traffic-clogged roads. There were lots of empty seats on the bus and it seemed many people stayed away. One lady told me she didn't know what the strike was about but she was going to be two hours late for work. She had the resignation of a hardened commuter used to such trials. Essex relies heavily on the Central Line and life without it is slow and difficult. As I write this I'm still on that bus... Mr Holness said recent talks between the parties over the action had been ""positive"" but they had ""not been able to agree on the reinstatement of a train driver who was dismissed for a serious breach of our safety regulations."" A 48-hour strike by rail workers on South Western Railway also began at midnight, affecting services to London Waterloo. Another Tube strike is scheduled for 7 November.

Cardi B files for divorce from Offset,"The New York rapper described their marriage as ""irretrievably broken"". The couple were wed in secret in 2017, and have a two-year-old daughter named Kulture. Court records obtained by the PA news agency show that Cardi is asking for ""primary physical custody"" of the child, and wants Offset to contribute for ""support and maintenance"". Cardi, 27, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, filed for divorce on Tuesday in her husband's home state of Georgia, where the couple have been living. Legal documents state that Cardi B and Offset - whose real name is Kiari Cephus - are now living in a ""bona fide state of separation"". There are ""no prospects for a reconciliation"" they said. Cardi B, whose hits include WAP, Bodak Yellow and I Like It, is asking for their assets to be split evenly. Offset and Cardi B: A timeline of their relationship Cardi B and Offset married in a private ceremony in 2017, and did not publicly reveal the news of their nuptials until around a year later. She announced they had split in December 2018, amid rumours of his cheating. After apologising on Instagram for being a ""selfish, messed-up husband"", Offset then asked for forgiveness on-stage in front of a crowd at her Rolling Loud concert, where he pulled out a sign made of roses that read: ""Take me back Cardi."" The rather public display of affection and apparent remorse was received poorly by Cardi B's fans online, with some calling the move ""toxic"". However, she urged people not to bash him for trying. ""I'm not saying that I'm gonna get back together with him, I just don't like that bashing online thing,"" she wrote on social media at the time, before the couple got back together. In an interview with Cosmopolitan earlier in the same year, the provocative Grammy-winning Bronx performer said she wanted to work on the relationship, noting what he did was ""not right"" but that ""I ain't no angel"". She celebrated their second wedding anniversary with a post on Instagram last year, alongside a picture of the two of them together. ""We keep learning and growing. That's what marriage about,"" read the caption. However, the relationship now appears to have come to an official end. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

High Streets hit as shop vacancy rate worst since 2015,"The vacancy rate was 10.3% in July, its highest level since January 2015, according to the British Retail Consortium and Springboard survey. Footfall also fell by 1.9% in July, the worst July performance for seven years. Diane Wehrle, Springboard insights director, said July had been ""much more challenging"" for shopping centres and High Streets than out of town stores. The survey showed that High Street footfall declined by 2.7% in July, and shopping centre footfall declined by 3.1%. In contrast, footfall in retail parks increased by 1.2%. 'Enhanced experience' Ms Wehrle added: ""Consumer demand is ever-more polarised between convenience and experience, and the stronger performance of out of town destinations where footfall rose by 1.2% in July reflects the fact that retail parks are successfully bridging the convenience-experience gap. ""They not only offer consumers accessible shopping environments with free parking and easy click and collect opportunities for online purchases, but many also combine this with an enhanced experience that includes coffee shops and casual dining restaurants, and some also have leisure facilities."" The town battling the High Street blues Chris Vallance, BBC's The World At One In a shopping arcade in Stockton-on-Tees, the loudspeakers are playing Empire State of Mind. ""Bright lights will inspire you,"" goes the chorus, but the canned music isn't inspiring all the shoppers. ""It's getting like a ghost town really,"" one says. ""They've made it nice, the area, but the shops are going one by one."" In 2018, data from the Centre for Retail Research found more than 2,500 mostly medium or large retail businesses failed, and the organisation's Joshua Bamfield now expects 2019 to be worse.

""Marks & Spencer, they closed and now Debenhams is going to close,"" Labour's Nigel Cooke, the borough council cabinet member for regeneration and housing, told Radio 4's World At One.

""If the government wishes to avoid seeing more empty shops in our town centres then they must act to relieve some of the pressure bearing down on the High Street,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""Currently, retail accounts for 5% of the economy, yet pays 10% of all business costs and 25% of all business taxes. The rising vacancy figures show this is simply not sustainable.

Daily Mail pays damages to JK Rowling,"Rowling sued the newspaper for libel in January over the piece which suggested she had told a false ""sob story"" about being stigmatised by churchgoers. The Daily Mail said it accepted the author had not made any false claims and apologised for the suggestion. It added Rowling was donating the unspecified damages to charity. According to documents filed at the High Court, the Harry Potter writer said she believed the newspaper's story - published on 27 September 2013 - was ""premised on a false picture"" of an article she had written 10 days previously on the website for the single parents' charity, Gingerbread. She said she had not accused fellow churchgoers of ""stigmatising"" or ""cruelly taunting her"", but had referred to ""a single occasion involving a woman who had visited the church one day while she was working there"". Rowling said the Daily Mail had been ""misleading"" and ""unfair"" in its story and had injured her reputation and caused her great distress and embarrassment. The newspaper's apology, printed on page two, said: ""Our September 28, 2013 article 'How JK's sob story about her single mother past surprised and confused the church members who cared for her' suggested that JK Rowling made a knowingly false and inexcusable claim in an article for the Gingerbread charity that people at her church had stigmatised her and cruelly taunted her for being a single mother. ""In fact Mrs Rowling recounted only one incident where a visitor to the church stigmatised and taunted her on a particular day. We accept that Ms Rowling's article did not contain any false claims and apologise for any contrary suggestion and have agreed to pay substantial damages to Ms Rowling, which she is donating to charity, and a contribution to her legal costs."" The newspaper admitted liability in January, agreeing to apologise and pay damages. However it disputed details of the settlement, which involved Rowling making a court statement about the case. Last month a High Court judge ruled the author could make the statement, saying there was ""no sufficient reason"" for the Daily Mail's publishers, Associated Newspapers, to refuse permission to read it. A date has yet to be set for Rowling to make the statement in court.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Venezuela political prisoners 'revolt' at Caracas jail,"Inmates held at El Helicoide, the headquarters of Venezuela's secret service, say they took over part of its cell blocks. They say they did so after a political prisoner was beaten. More than 300 political prisoners are being held in Venezuela, according to pressure group Foro Penal. Swollen face There is no official information about what happened at the Helicoide, the massive former shopping centre in central Caracas which houses Venezuela's secret service (Sebin). But people with close links to the political prisoners held there said the uprising had started after Gregory Sanabria was beaten up, allegedly by a non-political prisoner. Read more: The Sebin cells hold more than 300 inmates, with political prisoners and people accused of ordinary crimes locked up alongside each other. Many of the jailed opposition leaders have been accused of incitement to violence and vandalism, which the government argues are not politically motivated. Photos on social media show the swollen face of Mr Sanabria, a student held in El Helicoide pending trial ever since he took part in mass anti-government protest in 2014. According to Patricia Ceballos, whose husband Daniel is one of the political prisoners inside El Helicoide, the beating triggered a protest which was met with tear gas by the National Guard and riot police. Mr Ceballos, the former opposition mayor of the western city of San Cristóbal, said the inmates had taken control of parts of the jail. ""We're demanding that all political prisoner be freed, all of us who have been held here, kidnapped for years without justice or due process,"" he told CNN via telephone from inside the jail. 'I need help' Joshua Holt, a US citizen held at the jail for two years pending trial, pleaded for help in a video message sent as the uprising was apparently going on. Mr Holt, a former Mormon missionary from Utah, travelled to Caracas in June 2016 to marry his Venezuelan girlfriend. While waiting for their US visas, Mr Holt and his wife were detained in her family's house in Caracas and accused of hiding weapons. Mr Holt said he was fearing for his life. ""They're outside, they're trying to break in, they're saying they're going to kill me,"" the 26-year-old said as shouts could be heard. In a second video he addressed his compatriots directly, asking them to help free him. The US embassy in Caracas tweeted that it was ""very worried about the rebellion"". ""Joshua Holt and other US citizens are in danger,"" it said in a tweet in Spanish. ""The Venezuelan government is directly responsible for their security and we will hold them responsible if anything happens to them."" Political prisoners have long been complaining about the conditions they are held in and pressure groups inside Venezuela as well as abroad have called on the government of President Nicolás Maduro to free them but so far this has had little impact.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Justene Reece: Police failed to link stalking reports before death,"Nicholas Allen was jailed for 10 years for the manslaughter of Justene Reece, who killed herself as a ""direct result"" of his controlling behaviour. An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found Staffordshire Police officers missed the ""bigger picture"" of his offending. The force said it had improved its investigative approach to stalking. Ms Reece, 46, from Stafford, hanged herself in February 2017, leaving a note saying ""I've run out of fight"". The IOPC began its investigation a month later. Between an initial report in September 2016 and Ms Reece's death, the IOPC found that, of 34 incidents reported by Ms Reece, her friends, family and other agencies, 16 were not cross-referenced with any previous reports. It said seven of the 14 incidents reported by Ms Reece herself were not cross-checked at all. Allen's trial heard he had a string of convictions for assault and harassment against other partners, and had sent Ms Reece abusive voicemails, texts and Facebook messages and stalked her. His conviction was thought to be the first manslaughter case brought in such circumstances. Ms Reece obtained a non-molestation order against Allen in November 2016, which he breached seven times, the IOPC said. The police watchdog said that in December 2016, a now-retired senior officer chose not to arrest Allen for a reported breach of the order, because it was felt Ms Reece had been complicit by going with him to a pub after he turned up at the home where she was staying. The IOPC said it was the responsibility of the offender and not the victim to ensure the orders were complied with, and so did not accept the officer's reasoning - finding it unsatisfactory. Seven officers and one member of police staff will receive management action, as their performance was not judged to have met expected standards over the handling of calls and not completing risk assessments. 'Tragic death' ""It is evident from our investigation that there were potential opportunities for the police to engage more robustly with Mr Allen,"" IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said. ""The bigger picture of the level of harassment and stalking being perpetrated was not properly seen by police."" In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker apologised. The force has also accepted training recommendations to improve the linking of incidents and crimes. ""Since the tragic death of Justene we have made improvements to our safeguarding and investigative approach to stalking, but we have more work to do,"" Mr Baker said. ""We are committed to ensuring officers and staff understand stalking and its devastating impact so they can better respond to incidents reported to us.""

Man guilty of naked Toys R Us attack and abduction,"Przemyslaw Kaluzny is now facing a lengthy jail term after pleading guilty to the charges. CCTV footage of the 41-year-old running naked through Toys R Us in April 2015 was shown in court. It also emerged Kaluzny had been in a Polish criminal gang and has previous convictions for violent offences. Dundee Sheriff Court was told he had previously served a series of jail terms in Poland for violent offences, including a four-and-a-half year sentence for robbery and 10 months for hostage taking. He had also been a member of a gang that stole cars to order before he moved to Scotland in April 2014. The court heard that Kaluzny had taken ecstasy that he found in a Kinder Egg on the street before running amok in the store on Easter Sunday. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the court that two hours before the incident, Kaluzny had gone to a neighbours home where he ""did not appear himself"" and took the Class A drug before leaving in a car for the shop. The CCTV footage played in court shows Kaluzny completely naked, calmly walking past shoppers in the store. The six-year-old boy, who was with his father and grandmother, was in an aisle looking at toys when Kaluzny grabbed him. Ms Robertson told the court: ""Without saying a word and appearing calm, the accused approached them, and whilst still running he forcefully grabbed the boy with one arm, lifting him from the ground and proceeding to run off with him in his arm towards the front entrance door. ""He [the boy] immediately started crying hysterically and appeared petrified. The accused then went to leave the locus."" 'Heavy duty' gang One store worker repeatedly rammed Kaluzny with a trolley before the boy's grandmother - who cannot be named to protect the boy's identity - hit him with her handbag. Staff and shoppers then dived on top of Kaluzny as he struggled to get free. Kaluzny, who is presently detained at Murray Royal Hospital in Perth, pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing an offensive weapon, behaving in a threatening and abusive manner, public indecency, abduction, assault, assault to injury and vandalism. Defence solicitor Nicola Brown said Kaluzny had been part of a ring of ""heavy duty"" criminals before coming to Scotland to support a friend. She told the court he had become ""disillusioned"" and had taken the green tablets he had found in the Kinder Egg as a ""suicide bid"". Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC deferred sentence for background reports and remanded Kaluzny in custody in the meantime.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Aldi overtakes Co-op to become UK's fifth largest grocer,"Aldi's sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in the 12 weeks to 29 January, taking its market share to 6.2% and ahead of the Co-op's 6%, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel. It underlines the challenge the big retailers have faced from discounters such as Aldi and its German rival Lidl. Sales at Lidl rose 9.4%, taking its market share to 4.5%. ""Underpinned by an extensive programme of store openings, the past quarter has seen Aldi attract 826,000 more shoppers than during the same period last year,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. Healthier ranges Ten years ago ago Aldi was only Britain's 10th largest food retailer, accounting for less than 2% of the grocery market. Despite being overtaken by Aldi, Co-op's 2% sales increase was well ahead of the market, continuing a run of growth stretching back to July 2015. Mr McKevitt said: ""A significant own label sales increase of 7% was behind [Co-op's] strong performance, with healthier ranges successfully catering to consumers' good intentions for the new year."" Tesco remains the clear leader with more than 28% of the UK market. Its sales rose 0.3% over the 12-week period, which included the busy Christmas season. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business reporter Aldi will open its 700th store later this month and is planning to open a further 300 over the next five years. Along with Lidl, it has caused huge disruption in the supermarket aisles, stealing market share form the traditional ""big four"" grocers. But they've been fighting back so the discounters are having less of an easy ride these days. Aldi's growth, whilst still impressive, is slowing. And the more it tries to offer its customers, in terms of range and in store experience, the greater the danger that it strays from its low cost, efficient business model which has proved so effective. Rising prices Morrisons, the smallest of the ""big four"", increased sales by 1.9%, gaining market share for the first time since June 2015. Sales were flat at second-ranked Sainsbury's, but fell 1.9% at Asda, owned by US giant Wal-Mart. Overall, supermarket sales were up 1.7% year on year, Kantar said. The market researcher noted that well-publicised supply issues due to poor weather in southern Europe had affected sales of fresh produce. Mr McKevitt said: ""Eleven million households buy courgettes annually, but supply issues contributed to 759,000 fewer shoppers buying them this January - that's a 31% drop in spending compared with the same month last year. ""Sales of spinach also fell by 12%, in a clear sign that the poor weather in southern Europe has had a tangible impact on British shopping baskets."" Kantar said rising prices continued into the new year, with inflation on a basket of everyday groceries climbing to 0.7%. ""If prices continue to rise at the same rate for the rest of 2017, shoppers will find themselves around £27 worse off,"" Mr McKevitt said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK gets 24-hour esports gaming channel on TV,"Ginx eSports TV will be available via Sky's television service and will air footage from tournaments as well as produce original content. It plans to show Valve's Dota 2 international competition as well as global tournaments for Counter Strike. But one expert wondered where the audience for the channel would was going to come from. Competition time In a statement, Ginx boss Michiel Bakker said the channel aimed to give esports ""significant mainstream TV exposure"" that would complement the online streaming of gaming that many watch. He said he hoped that making the channel available to Sky's millions of customers would help people discover esports for the first time. It would also give established fans a different perspective on competitions and tournaments, he added. The channel will face significant competition for its audience as many gamers prefer to watch gaming streams online. Many follow regular gamers on the Twitch streaming service, on YouTube and Facebook or via sites run by game makers to broadcast top tournaments. Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard bought the Major League Gaming firm as the start of a plan to make competitive gaming more accessible. Increasing numbers of established broadcasters are also starting to put gaming tournaments on mainstream channel. Last year, the BBC aired the highlights of the quarter finals of Riot Games' League of Legends world championships. And, in the US, the sports network ESPN has also started to focus more on pro-gamers. A report published earlier in 2016 by Deloitte predicted that global revenues from esports will rise by 25% this year to $500m (£353m). Its regular audience will likely top 150 million people globally, it predicted. Alec Meer from gaming news site Rock, Paper Shotgun wondered who would be watching the tournaments and gaming-themed shows. ""It is difficult to imagine what the channel could possibly do to entice people away from watch-anywhere esports with favoured commentators and streams on YouTube and Twitch and back to broadcast TV,"" he said. Many young people had simply ""abandoned"" TV in favour of web video, he added. ""Perhaps it's in with a chance if it can bag exclusive rights, as with football, but even if it does there's so much other esports out there that there's simply no way of cornering the market,"" Mr Meer told the BBC. ""Good luck to 'em,"" he said. ""It's nice to see more gaming on TV for sure, but I rather suspect it's far too late at this stage.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Inca success in Peruvian Andes 'thanks to llama dung',"By Caroline Anning BBC News Machu Picchu, the famous Inca city set in the Peruvian Andes, celebrates the centenary of its ""'discovery"" by the outside world this July. Dignitaries will descend on site for a glitzy event in July marking 100 years since US explorer Hiram Bingham came upon the site, but the origins of Machu Picchu were far less glamorous. According to a study published in archaeological review Antiquity, llama droppings provided the basis for the growth of Inca society. It was the switch from hunter-gathering to agriculture 2,700 years ago that first led the Incas to settle and flourish in the Cuzco area where Machu Picchu sits, according to the study's author Alex Chepstow-Lusty. Mr Chepstow-Lusty, of the French Institute of Andean Studies in Lima, said the development of agriculture and the growing of maize crops is key to the growth of societies. ""Cereals make civilisations,"" he said. Mr Chepstow-Lusty has spent years analysing organic deposits in the mud of a small lake, ""more of a pond really,"" called Marcaccocha on the road between the lower-lying jungle and Machu Picchu. His team found a correlation between the first appearance of maize pollen around 700BC - which showed for the first time that the cereal could be grown at high altitudes - and a spike in the number of mites who feed on animal excrement. They concluded that the widespread shift to agriculture was only possible with an extra ingredient: organic fertilisers on a vast scale. In other words, lots of llama droppings. Llamas' legacy Llamas were and still are commonly used in the Peruvian Andes to carry goods and provide meat and wool. Marcaccocha is situated next to an ancient trade route, and llamas transporting goods between the jungle and the mountains would stop to have a drink and ""defecate communally"". ""This provided fertiliser which was easily collectable as today by the local people for the surrounding field systems,"" Mr Chepstow-Lusty said. As the Incas moved from eating wild quinoa to maize, which is higher in calories, their society developed in the Cuzco area. Some 1,800 years after they first moved from hunter-gathering to agriculture, around 1100AD, a bout of prolonged warmer weather allowed the civilisation to really flourish, leading to the building of large stone settlements like Ollaytaytambo and Machu Picchu. Today, the Incas are long gone, largely wiped out by the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. But their descendants, the Quechua, still use llama droppings for fertiliser and cooking fuel. ""The valley is full of indigenous people who follow that way of life from 2,000 years ago,"" said Mr Chepstow-Lusty. When the guests arrive in Machu Picchu to celebrate 100 years since Hiram Bingham brought it to the world's notice, they can perhaps thank the humble llama for the sight they see before them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ethiopia Tigray crisis: Fear of mass starvation,"The government-run Tigray Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) is assessing needs following the conflict there. The federal government declared victory at the end of November. But sporadic fighting has continued and the UN has described the humanitarian situation as ""severe"". It added that ""reports indicate that food is not available or is extremely limited in markets, posing increased risks of malnutrition"". The ECC says that 4.5 million people need emergency food aid in Tigray, according to a figure quoted in a UN report. The population of Tigray is between 5-7 million. More than 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan. In a statement on Friday, the Ethiopia embassy in London said the authorities wanted to help those in need. ""The government of Ethiopia remains committed to working closely with its humanitarian and development partners to address any outstanding challenges that could hinder the safe, effective, and efficient delivery of humanitarian assistance to all affected populations,"" it said. The UN has said that access to parts of Tigray is still limited but some aid is getting through. Communication with much of the region remains difficult as phone lines and the internet have been cut making the verification of reports hard. 'People dying while they sleep' According to the leaked notes taken by a participant at an ECC meeting on 8 January, an official from the interim administration of the central part of Tigray ""said that the situation [on] the ground is dire"". ""Food and non-food items or other livelihoods are either looted or destroyed. He also added that if urgent emergency assistance is not mobilised hundreds of thousands might starve to death."" ""People are dying because of starvation. In Adwa people are dying while they are sleeping,"" he was quoted as saying. Another official, quoted in notes from a meeting on 1 January describing the humanitarian needs, said that ""while we were on the road and visit different places, people asked our escort for a single biscuit"". Ethiopia's defence forces entered Tigray early in November to oust the region's ruling party after its troops had captured federal military bases. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed insists that the army has been using proportional force to restore law and order and bring a ""criminal clique"" to justice. Since the end of November, there has been an operation to find fugitive Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) party leaders who vowed to continue the fight after the regional capital was captured by the army. On Friday, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said in a statement that the situation on the ground had gone ""well beyond a purely internal 'law and order' operation"". ""We receive consistent reports of ethnic-targeted violence, killings, massive looting, rapes, forceful returns of refugees [to Eritrea] and possible war crimes,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Saudi Arabia profile - overview,"But its rulers face the delicate task of responding to pressure for reform while combating extremist violence. Named after the ruling Al Saud family, which came to power in the 18th century, the country includes the Hijaz region - the birthplace of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad and the cradle of Islam. This fact, combined with the Al Sauds' espousal of a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, has led it to develop a strongly religious self-identity. The harsh punishments in the Wahhabi interpretation of Islamic law include public beheadings for a range of crimes, and these continue to attract criticism from international rights organisations. Saudi Arabia was established in 1932 by King Abd-al-Aziz - known as the Lion of Najd - who seized Hejaz from the Hashemite family and united the country under his family's rule. Since his death in 1953 he has been succeeded by various sons. The Al Saud dynasty's monopoly of power meant that during the 20th century successive kings were able to concentrate on economic modernisation and on developing the country's role as a regional power. It has always been in the ruling family's interests to preserve stability in the region and to clamp down on extremist elements. To this end, it welcomed the stationing of US troops in the country after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But the leadership's refusal to tolerate any kind of opposition may have encouraged the growth of dissident groups such as Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which benefited from popular resentment against the role of the US in the Middle East. Members of the large Shia minority, who form a majority in oil-rich Eastern Province, have become increasingly vocal in their demands for civil rights. After the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of 11 September 2001 - carried out mainly by Saudi nationals - the Saudi authorities were further torn between their natural instincts to step up internal security and pressure to allow a greater degree of democracy. In 2003 suicide bombers suspected of links with al-Qaeda killed 35 people - including a number of foreigners - in the capital Riyadh. The targets of other attacks have included foreign workers and, since the rise of the Sunni extremist group Islamic State, the Shias of Eastern Province. Demands for political reform have increased. Municipal elections in 2005 were a first, limited exercise in democracy. But political parties are banned - the opposition is organised from outside the country - and activists who publicly broach the subject of reform risk being jailed. Calls for social change are on the rise, too. Activists for women's rights have become more vocal, focusing on practical campaigns such as the right to drive. Social media users are also testing the limits of freedom of expression. Saudi Arabia sits on more than 25% of the world's known oil reserves. It is capable of producing more than 10 million barrels per day; that figure is set to rise.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pangbourne sprays to kill oak processionary caterpillar 'dangerous',"By Linda SerckBBC News, South Birds, bats and rare insects were affected by Forestry Commission aerial sprays to kill a moth larvae, Butterfly Conservation and Buglife claimed. It was unclear if oak processionary caterpillar larvae were even present in the Pangbourne copses, they said. The Forestry Commission said it had ""strong reason to suspect"" it was. It was the first aerial spraying of its kind in the UK and was considered more effective than ground treatments as the caterpillars are attracted to leaves at the top of the trees, the Forestry Commission said. 'Breeding highly likely' The spraying of the pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) took place in Herridge's and Broom Copses, both within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The caterpillar contains a toxin in its hairs that can cause itchy rashes, eye and throat irritations. They feed on oak trees and produce silken nests on trunks and branches. The commission, a government department, said it had destroyed a nest in each copse last year. But Butterfly Conservation's Mark Parsons said the aerial spraying, in May, was ""a disproportionate response"". He said any confirmed nests had been destroyed and that this was ""a precautionary spray just in case any escaped detection last year"". ""It is a sledgehammer to crack a nut,"" he said. A commission spokesman said the discovery of the nests last year ""gave us strong reason to suspect that there would have been others which were not detected"". ""The adult moths which would have emerged from these nests are highly likely to have established a breeding population in the woods, raising the prospect of the pest spreading into other areas,"" he said. 'Really bad impact' Mr Parsons said the strain of the Bt pesticide used ""will kill a wide range of moth and butterfly larvae"", a number of which are scarce in the UK. ""Caterpillars form the food of many birds, which will be feeding their young at this time of year, and therefore there could be a knock-on effect on the birds locally,"" he said. Post-hibernation bats would have been affected as they also feed on spring moths. The commission spokesman said: ""We understand and share concerns that caterpillars of certain other moth and butterfly species present at the time of spraying might be affected. ""The scientific advice that we have received is that they will re-colonise the woods again from surrounding areas, and we have agreed a five-year programme to monitor this."" Buglife pesticides officer Vanessa Amaral-Rogers said the commission ""should have gone in and surveyed the site"" beforehand, because the treatment had not been carried out before or tested in the UK. She added: ""Oak woodland is one of the most important habitats for invertebrates and Lepidoptera [butterfly] species. There is going to be a really bad impact in there.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kurdish PKK rebels 'begin leaving Turkey' after truce,"""We know that they have started moving,"" Selahattin Demirtas, a pro-Kurdish politician involved in the peace process, told AFP news agency. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) announced last month a phased withdrawal to start early in May. More than 40,000 people have died in their 30-year fight against Turkey. There was no immediate official confirmation of the move from Turkey but an unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: ""We have observed movement among [PKK] group members, but have not been able to establish whether this is regrouping or preparation for a withdrawal."" The PKK is believed to have up to 2,000 fighters inside Turkey and their full withdrawal may take up to four months. They are expected to cross the border on foot, heading for their bases in the Qandil Mountains of Iraq. Abdullah Ocalan, the veteran PKK leader in prison in Turkey, ordered the withdrawal in March as part of peace negotiations with Ankara. Withdrawal nerves Gultan Kisinak, who co-chairs the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) along with Mr Demirtas, told the Associated Press news agency that a first group of fighters had started to move toward the border with northern Iraq. A PKK spokesman, Bakhtiyar Dogan, told the Kurdish newspaper Hawlati that between 200 and 500 fighters would withdraw on Wednesday. They would, he said, leave from the Semdinli and Sirnak areas of Turkey ""on three fronts"". According to AFP, PKK fighters complained on the eve of the withdrawal that the Turkish state had increased its forces in the border area and was carrying out surveillance flights. Such actions, they said, were ""delaying the peace process"" and paving the way for ""provocations and clashes"". The Turkish army did not confirm any extra measures but said their ""fight against any terrorism"" continued. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc was quoted as saying by AP: ""We are following the issue. It's the results that are important for us. We feel that we are close to getting results."" The PKK's acting leader, Murat Karayilan, warned in April that the fighters would strike back and the withdrawal would halt ""immediately"" if they were attacked. ""We have no doubt about the state but fear provocation from dark forces,"" Mr Demirtas said. During a 1999 withdrawal, the Turkish military attacked the rebels, killing some 500. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly pledged the army will not attack any PKK fighters who withdrew. On Tuesday, he said that ""laying down weapons"" should be the group's top priority in order for the peace process to succeed.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Christians persecuted by Islamists, says Prince Charles","By John McManusBBC News The Prince of Wales made his comments after visiting the British branches of churches based in the region. The prince heard accounts of Christians being murdered and families forced from their homes. The upheavals of the Arab Spring have left many religious minorities vulnerable to accusation and attack. Deeply troubled Charles, accompanied by Prince Ghazi of Jordan, visited the Egyptian Coptic Church centre in Stevenage and the Syriac Orthodox cathedral in west London. The two royals met church members who had either suffered intimidation or family members whose safety they feared for. Later at a reception at Clarence House, attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop of Westminster and the Chief Rabbi, Prince Charles said he felt deeply troubled by the plight of Christians. ""For 20 years I have tried to build bridges between Islam and Christianity to dispel ignorance and misunderstanding,"" he told the audience. ""The point though, surely, is that we have now reached a crisis where bridges are rapidly being deliberately destroyed by those with a vested interest in doing so. ""This is achieved through intimidation, false accusation and organised persecution including to the Christian communities in the Middle East at the present time."" Wary relationship The Coptic Church traces its origins back to the 1st Century when it was founded by the apostle St Mark. The Syriac Orthodox Church says it was established by St Peter who became its first bishop. Christians living in the Middle East have often had a wary relationship with their Muslim neighbours. The Arab Spring though has led to an upsurge in violence with many Christians fleeing the region to avoid attack. In Egypt, violence against the Copts increased after the military overthrow of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi. Hundreds of church properties, homes and businesses were attacked and looted. Many Islamists accused the Christian community of playing a role in President Morsi's downfall after the Coptic Pope Tawadros II publicly backed the country's new military rulers. Falling population In Syria, the Christian community has been suspected by rebels of siding with President Bashar al-Assad. In reality, Syrian Christians say they have refused to take any side in the country's conflict. Yet one Christian leader has said that almost a third of Christians have now left the country. Minority Muslims, such as Sufis, have also frequently been attacked by Islamists in South Asia as well as Arab countries. The falling Christian population in the Middle East has led to concerns over the religion's survival in the region of its birth. British Christians have urged the government and church leaders to do more to help their co-religionists.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Warrior women of Eigg and other tales from Small Isles,"By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter Muck, Rum, Eigg and Canna lie between Ardnamurchan on the west Highland coast and the Isle of Skye. In The Small Isles, author Prof John Hunter said the islands could today be described as ""calm havens"". But in the past they were the scene of a 16th Century massacre and also have a story about female warriors murdering Christian pilgrims. The book brings together the ""forgotten histories"" of the four islands for the first time, according to Historic Environment Scotland, which commissioned the writing of it. Prof Hunter is emeritus professor of ancient history and archaeology at the University of Birmingham, an honorary fellow at the University of Edinburgh and an expert on Scottish islands. He said: ""The Small Isles, consisting of Muck, Rum, Eigg and Canna, are known mostly because they have interesting names. ""They sit a good hour's ferry ride from Mallaig off the Scotland's west coast, and you might be justified in thinking these islands would have been good places for a quiet life? Wrong. ""Today, they may be calm havens of retreat, but their quiet landscapes hide centuries of hardship, intrigue, controversy and violence."" 'Bandit country' Human activity on the islands can be traced back thousands of years. Some of the earliest people were drawn to the isles because bloodstone, a rock found on Rum that can be shaped in the same way as flint. In following centuries, Prof Hunter said the islands were ""bandit country"" where even early Christian missionaries met with bloody violence. On Eigg in 617AD, St Donnan was beheaded and his fellow monks murdered. ""Legend tells how the murders were carried out by large female warriors who lived on the Sgurr - the great volcanic outcrop that broods over the skyline on Eigg,"" said Prof Hunter. 'Hide secrets' The historian added that worst was to come in the 16th Century when almost the entire population of the island was wiped out during a feud between the clans Macdonald and MacLeod. A band of MacLeods from Skye landed on Eigg where they found, and then massacred, the isle's Macdonalds in the cave where they were hiding from the raiders. The book, which includes early 19th Century maps and archive photographs of landscapes and people, also examines the effects of the Highland Clearances on the Small Isles and the construction of Victorian sporting estates. Prof Hunter said: ""The Small Isles are fascinating in how they both display and hide their secrets within their modern landscapes. ""There are few places so geographically concentrated that provide such a vivid illustration of Scotland's past from prehistory to the present day.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Evan Lloyd Evans jailed after 'appalling' horses case,"Evan Lloyd Evans, 69, of Chwilog, Gwynedd, was found guilty of keeping the 51 horses in ""appalling"" conditions at his stud farm at an earlier hearing. Nine of the horses were put to sleep, Caernarfon Magistrates Court heard. The RSPCA said the sentence sent a strong welfare message to horse owners and breeders. The judge was told that looking after the horses since June 2012 had cost the welfare charity £300,000 but that Evans had no money. He was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the welfare needs of 51 horses. The court heard RSPCA officers visited him on 27 June 2012, and a vet put nine horses to sleep due to untreatable hoof conditions and to prevent further suffering. Another 50 horses were removed. RSPCA inspector Mark Roberts said: ""The conditions we found at Cricieth Stud were appalling and completely inappropriate for the ponies kept there. ""Many of them had acute problems with their feet and other serious health issues. ""We had been alerted to the fact there were many ponies in unsuitable conditions but did not expect to have to remove 50 of them on veterinary advice. ""In addition the vets also advised that nine had to be put to sleep as sadly their condition was so extreme there was no other way to alleviate their suffering."" ""It was an extremely bad situation made worse by the fact that many of the ponies were virtually unhandled making any necessary treatment incredibly difficult to carry out."" Nigel Weller, defending, said Evans had spent his life devoted to a particular breed of Welsh mountain ponies and was proud of their bloodline. His ponies were well known and desired but during a period of several months he fell below the standards expected. Insp Roberts said the case highlighted how ""over breeding and overstocking can spiral out of control"". ""This is a fair sentence and sends a strong message to all horse owners and breeders that they must put the welfare of their horses before all else,"" he added. Tony Evans, north and mid Wales field officer for the World Horse Welfare charity, said: ""It saddens me to think that all the help and advice that was given to the owner failed to have any significant effect. ""As our main priority has to be the welfare of the ponies, we had no choice than to involve the RSPCA to undertake stronger measures. ""In many of the situations we deal with, long and costly prosecution cases can often be avoided if the owner follows the advice given by World Horse Welfare field officers and takes appropriate action.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Euro 2016: Wales' Belarusian fan travels from New York,"By Max EvansBBC News Alex Zyl, 35, originally of Belarus, began following the team after befriending Wales fans 16 years ago in his country's capital, Minsk. Mr Zyl, who now lives in the United States, travelled from New York to watch Wales' 3-0 win against Russia in Toulouse on Monday. He said Wales fans were ""always friendly and always fun"". Mr Zyl said: ""For a long time Wales got so many defeats, they didn't qualify for any major tournaments. ""This is the first time they have qualified and they make real progress. ""It's fantastic - top of the league, that's why I like Wales."" Chris Coleman's team now face Northern Ireland in Paris on Saturday after topping group B and making the last 16. Mr Zyl said the 3-0 win in Toulouse was ""doubly special"" for him, given his own native land's rivalry with Russia. And the Welsh travelling contingent is full of supporters who have covered large amounts of ground to make it to France. 'Worth every penny' Lee Griffiths, originally of Bridgend, also flew from the US to watch Wales' opening group game against Slovakia in Bordeaux on 11 June. He said he had not wanted to miss the ""biggest day in Welsh football history"". And Mike Lambert, 60, originally of Cardiff, made the trip to France from Thailand, where he has lived for two years. He said there was a ""huge amount of expense"" and a 13-hour flight but the trip would be ""worth every penny"". He first watched Wales play against England at Cardiff's Ninian park in 1970 - a 1-1 draw. ""I had the bug and since then I have seen them play in Andorra and Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Belgium, Croatia and Cyprus, Scotland and Serbia and many many more,"" added Mr Lambert, who lives in Thailand's Isaan region. Some reports have suggested Saturday's fixture will see up to 50,000 fans travelling to Paris. And should they win that match, there could be a chance for fans to clock up more miles. While one possible last eight match will take place in Paris the other will be in Lille.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Rural communities being ignored and underrated, say peers","A group of peers said a new agenda for the countryside was needed similar to the government's industrial strategy. Priorities included improving mobile and broadband connections, replacing lost bank and bus services and tackling social isolation, the House of Lords Rural Economy Committee said. The government said it was committed to ""rural proofing"" policies. Ministers plan to spend £3.5bn on supporting economic development in the countryside by the end of 2020 through the Rural Development Programme. The cross-party committee of peers said policies suitable for urban and suburban areas had too often been foisted upon the countryside. As well as improving communications, it is calling for action to address the supply and cost of housing and a lack of training for people working in rural industries. ""Successive governments have underrated the contribution rural economies can make to the nation's prosperity and wellbeing,"" it said. ""They have applied policies which are often inappropriate for rural England. This must change. With rural England at a point of major transition, a different approach is needed."" Lord Foster, the Lib Dem peer and former MP who chairs the committee, said the ""clear inequalities"" between urban and rural areas could not be allowed to continue. He called for a policy blueprint of equal ambition to the government's industrial strategy to realise the potential of struggling and under-performing areas. The Campaign to Protect Rural England said too few politicians had a real understanding of the needs of the countryside, despite the fact one in five of the population lived there. It said investment was needed in housing and other infrastructure to make market towns and villages attractive places to live and work. ""A failure to address the unique and specific needs of these communities has put them at risk of being left behind,"" said its chief executive Crispin Truman. Telecoms regulator Ofcom warned last year of a widening urban-rural divide in broadband provision. Only 41% of rural premises received a mobile data link of of 2Mbps or higher, it found, compared with 83% in urban areas. The government has set aside £200m to fund full fibre broadband connections in rural and hard-to-reach areas across the UK by 2033. ""We will continue to champion the countryside, driving forward high-speed broadband in hard-to-reach places, increasing housing availability in rural areas and supporting the creation of more than 6,000 jobs through our dedicated fund for rural businesses,"" it said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Tories would scrap stamp duty on £250,000 homes","Stamp duty is charged at 1% of the price of a property sold for between £125,000 and £250,000, with control of the tax to be devolved. Tories said the policy costing £20m would boost the housing market. The Welsh government said it would announce stamp duty proposals when they were ""fully costed and developed"". Welsh Conservative Leader Andrew RT Davies said it was most people's dream to own their own home. A buyer would save £1,600 on the average purchase price in Wales of £160,000. Around 13,000 homes in the £125,000 to £250,000 bracket were sold in Wales last year. The Welsh Conservatives said they were setting out the principle of the policy and there would be more details in their manifesto for the 2016 assembly election. This is the first defined policy on stamp duty for Wales outlined by any of the parties. It is understood Mr Davies believes that by ""sounding the horn of low tax"" Wales can begin to reverse a ""brain drain"" from Wales to London, and send a message to the ""strivers and the ambitious"" that they can be better off in Wales. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""If you ask most people what their dream is, it is to own their own property. 'Secure the deal' ""And one of the things that proves to be the biggest obstacle is the final couple of pounds people need to put in place to secure that property. ""And stamp duty is one of the equations you have to jump through to secure the deal."" Mr Davies said his proposals would ensure £1,600 ""goes back to the purchaser"". He added: ""That would enable the deal to be sealed and ultimately allow people to have the dream of home ownership here in Wales."" Stamp duty is zero for property selling for up to £125,000. Between £125,000 and £250,000 it is 1% and between £250,000 and £500,000 it is 3%. For properties costing £500,000 to £1m it is 4%. The Conservatives said they would levy stamp duty at 3% for properties above £250,000. A spokesman for Welsh Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the Conservative policy would cost £25m a year ""based on the recent subdued market"" but was likely to cost ""considerably more"" in the future as the housing market picked up. ""As a responsible government we have already started to consult with the housing industry to get their views on the best way to take stamp duty forward in Wales,"" he added. ""When we have fully costed and developed plans for stamp duty we will put forward our proposals."" Control of stamp duty is being devolved by UK ministers, together with other new taxation and borrowing powers under the draft Wales Bill in response to recommendations from the Silk Commission in 2012.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Protests against train fare rises held at more than 100 stations,"Campaigners Action For Rail organised protests at more than 100 stations, including in London, Birmingham and Glasgow, as commuters returned to work following the festive break. It comes after ticket prices in Britain rose an average of 2.3% on Monday. The government said fare rises had been ""fairly balanced"" between passengers and taxpayers. 'Extracting value' The union-backed Campaign for Better Transport held a protest at London King's Cross station, which was attended by shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Mr McDonald said: ""We've now seen a rise of 27% since 2010 and wages haven't kept pace with this at all. ""There is another way of doing this. We don't have to have a system that just is predicated from extracting value out of passengers all the time. ""It's about time they were put first, ahead of profits."" This year's rise in fares is the highest since January 2014, when they increased by 2.8%. Figures vary between operators, with fares on Virgin Trains East Coast services rising by 4.9%. The government uses the previous July's retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation to determine increases in regulated fares, which was 1.9%. Regulated fares account for about 40% of all tickets and include season tickets on most commuter routes and some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys. Train operating companies set the prices of other tickets but are bound by competition rules. The increases do not apply to Northern Ireland. Bruce Williamson, of independent campaign group Railfuture, called on the government to use the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) - currently 0.6% - for regulated fare rises, rather than RPI, claiming it is a ""much more accurate figure"" for measuring inflation. But the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, said about 97p in every pound paid by passengers was going back into running and improving services. RDG chief executive Paul Plummer added: ""Money from fares is helping to sustain investment in the longer, newer trains and more punctual journeys that passengers want."" Virgin Trains East Coast said an overhaul of its pricing strategy meant there would be 10,000 more discounted advanced fares available every week. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""We are delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for more than a century, providing more seats and services. ""We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sir Philip Green drops 'gagging' legal action,"Last October, the Telegraph published a story saying a prominent businessman had been accused of harassment. The Topshop boss was later named as the businessman in the House of Lords. As a result, Sir Philip said he had been the subject of ""vicious"" and ""untrue"" personal attacks in the media. The statement also said that Sir Philip is ""not guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". Sir Philip's representative would not say why the businessman had dropped the legal action. When the allegations first emerged, Sir Philip acknowledged there had ""been some banter"", but said it had ""never been offensive"". At the heart of the issue are non-disclosure agreements signed by five individuals. In his statement, Sir Philip said that the Telegraph had helped break those agreements and threatened to make the information public. In doing so, the newspaper had exposed the individuals to ""significant risk and future legal action"", the statement said. It also said: ""Due to the ongoing confidentiality obligations and injunction still in place, Arcadia and Sir Philip cannot comment on the detail of any allegations, but confirm that any grievances are treated with the utmost seriousness and are investigated thoroughly in accordance with best practice."" It was Lord Hain who, last October, identified Sir Philip as the businessmen alluded to in the Telegraph article. He did so in the House of Lords which gave him protection from legal action. ""Parliamentary privilege has always been resented by the rich and powerful when it is used as I did in this case to defend human rights and justice when under attack. It is of fundamental constitutional importance as the only absolute right to free speech cemented in our law,"" Lord Hain said in a statement. Fortune Sir Philip used to be known as the king of the High Street. He built a fortune from a retail empire that included Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. He sold BHS in March 2015 for £1, but it went into administration a year later, leaving a £571m hole in its pension fund. He later agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. In a report into the collapse of BHS, MPs called the episode ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"". He and his wife Cristina are estimated by Forbes to be worth £3.8bn.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bombardier ruling: Q&A,"By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Business Correspondent In December, the US Commerce Department ruled the UK and Canada had given unfair subsidies to Bombardier to help it build the aircraft. But in a surprise ruling, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) rejected the complaint brought by Boeing. We look at the case. Why did Boeing bring the case? The case relates to a major order for Bombardier from the US airline Delta for 75 C-Series aircraft. Boeing complained to the US Commerce Department that they had been sold at ""absurdly low prices"" in violation of trade law and this was made possible by unfair subsidies to Bombardier from the British and Canadian governments. Bombardier has received £135m in UK aid, almost all of it a loan towards a new C-Series wing factory in Belfast which opened in 2013. About 50 companies in the UK supply Bombardier with parts for the C-Series. How did Bombardier and the UK react? The UK government sided with Bombardier. The company employs about 4,000 people in Northern Ireland. Its main factories are in constituencies held by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have a confidence-and-supply deal keeping Theresa May in power. The prime minister lobbied President Donald Trump on Bombardier's behalf, but the government resisted trade union calls to cancel defence contracts with Boeing. Bombardier said Boeing never lost out in the Delta order as it does not make the small size of plane requested. Some analysts wondered if Boeing was simply out to damage a competitor. What had the US Commerce Department decided? Following an investigation last year, it made a final ruling on 20 December. It recommended an import tariff of 292% be added to the price of each C-Series plane sold in America. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: ""The United States will always stand up for American workers and companies being harmed by unfair imports."" Had jobs been at risk? Cost over-runs on the C-Series almost bankrupted Bombardier. Orders have been sluggish and the fear was tariffs would damage sales prospects in America and have a knock-on impact on jobs. The stakes were arguably made higher because Bombardier is the biggest manufacturing company in Northern Ireland and is important to its economy. However, even before its victory at the US ITC, Bombardier was hopeful for the future after Airbus announced it would acquire a controlling stake in the C-Series and promised to boost its fortunes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Severn Trent 'used Uber drivers to look at water leaks',"Severn Trent said it had deployed the drivers on about 50 small leaks ""as a cheaper way to get live video footage"" than using technicians. They sent images to engineers back at base who dispatched the most appropriate teams to the job, it added. The water company's programme had ""huge safety implications for customers, drivers, and the public at large"", the GMB union said. Water services regulation authority Ofwat said it expects all companies to ""consider whether they are using efficient and effective tools and resources"". The GMB said Severn Trent had been using ""Uber and taxi drivers"" over two weeks for dozens of jobs. The union's national officer Stuart Fegan said: ""When I found out Severn Trent are using taxi drivers to investigate leaks, I thought it must be a joke. ""But no one is laughing - this has got huge safety implications."" Mr Fegan said water engineers were ""highly trained specialists"" who could spot ""if water is contaminated and if water produces a risk to the public"". He added: ""I doubt most taxi drivers can. ""And how is someone going to feel after they report a leak, expecting a Severn Trent worker to attend with a uniform and the necessary training and a taxi driver turns up. They'd think it was a hoax call.""

Websites told to ensure cookies comply with UK law,"On 26 May European privacy laws come in to force in the UK which give people more control over what data websites gather about them. This means changes to what websites can do with cookies - small text files used to log data about repeat visitors. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said sites need to be sure their cookies comply with the law. Making complaints The ICO issued guidance to firms ahead of the 26 May deadline but said that the document was a ""work in progress"". ""It is not offering all the answers,"" said an ICO spokesperson. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has drawn up the regulations firms must take to comply with the law. It is now working on the ""technical solutions"" firms can follow to meet the requirements it set down. As the technical solutions are being worked on, firms are being encouraged to prepare by examining their cookies to see what purpose they fulfil and reach a decision about whether they require ""informed consent"" from visitors to keep using them. This review process was important to undertake, said the spokesperson, because from 26 May the ICO is obliged to investigate any complaints it gets about the use of non-compliant cookies. ""We will look into those complaints and see what that company is doing to work towards compliance,"" said the ICO. Only by showing the results of this work will web firms be able to convince the ICO they are intent on complying. The DCMS said while complaints may be investigated, it does not expect the ICO to take enforcement action until information about technical solutions has been drawn up. Websites are being asked to review cookie policies because technical solutions involving users tweaking settings on browsing software are not going to be available by 26 May. As a result, web firms will have to decide for themselves if consent can be obtained Third-party cookies, used by advertisers to track users across sites, are likely to be particularly problematic to review and police.

Extra £50m to reduce Welsh NHS waiting times announced,"The new money is aimed at reducing waits for pre-arranged surgery, diagnostics and specialist therapies. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said the cash, which will come from government reserves, will help the NHS deal with extra demand. But Angela Burns of the Welsh Conservatives said better planning was also required. Mr Gething said: ""The demand on the NHS in Wales, as well as across the other nations in the UK, continues to grow. ""This places additional pressures on the service to deliver timely care for patients."" The £50m, which is for the current financial year, is 0.68% of the overall £7.3bn Welsh Government health, wellbeing and sport budget. The health secretary added: ""While I expect health boards to plan and deliver sustainable services that meet the needs of their local populations, the £50m investment I'm announcing will help NHS Wales deal with the extra demand by further reducing waiting times in key areas - such as elective surgery, diagnostics and therapies."" Referrals to hospital-based services have increased by 20% from 2013 to 2016 - from 1.07m in the 12 months ending March 2013 to 1.27m in 12 months ending in 2016, according to the Welsh Government. The number of people who had been waiting more than eight weeks for diagnostics services stood at 7,252 in May, down from 24,952 in May 2014. But in May 2010, that figure was much lower at 2,588. The number of people waiting more than 36 weeks from a GP referral to treatment stood at 12,354 in March 2017. The Welsh Government said this was down from 28,654 in August 2015. Angela Burns, the Welsh Conservative health spokeswoman, said suffering endured by patients ""idling on waiting lists"" is ""intolerably cruel"" and added that ""while extra cash is always welcome, it isn't just about money"". ""It's about planning and more effective use of existing resources and cutting down on waste,"" she said. Ms Burns calls on Mr Gething to ""not delay in bringing forward a decisive, innovative and target-led strategy informed by science and the expertise of professional bodies in order to address the perennial issues that hold our health service back"". Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, said the ""announcement is a small percentage of the overall budget"". ""This is yet another example of the Labour Welsh Government doing too little too late,"" he said, adding ""waiting times have long been a scandal in Wales with patients here enduring far longer waits than their counterparts in Scotland and England over recent years"".

Yemen war: UN agrees to send war crime experts,"The UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution to set up a group of ""eminent"" experts. It was a compromise between Western powers and a group of Arab states that included Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition is backing Yemeni pro-government forces in a conflict with the rebel Houthi movement. More than 8,530 people, 60% of them civilians, have been killed and 48,800 injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground since March 2015, according to the UN. The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of some kind of humanitarian assistance, created the largest food security emergency in the world, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 700,000 people since April. Under the deal agreed in Geneva on Friday, a group of ""eminent international and regional experts"" will carry out a comprehensive examination of ""all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights and other appropriate and applicable fields of international law"" in Yemen. It will ""establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged violations and abuses, and where possible, identify those responsible"". The resolution was approved after a proposal from some EU states and Canada for a more robust investigation with the formal status of a ""commission of inquiry"" was withdrawn. An alternative proposal from the Arab group to send three experts to Yemen to investigate and to engage with a domestic inquiry established by Yemen's government was also shelved. Saudi Arabia, which had lobbied hard against a commission of inquiry - even reportedly threatening to restrict trade ties with countries which backed it - publicly thanked the UK, US and France for their co-operation in achieving a compromise. The three states also back the coalition's intervention in Yemen. The weaker resolution may be a disappointment to human rights groups, who had called for a commission of inquiry, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva reports. They allege that war crimes and crimes against humanity are being carried out with impunity in Yemen, and that the conflict is directly responsible for the cholera epidemic. UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Raad Al Hussein had also asked the council to approve a commission of inquiry; his office has doubts that Yemen's domestic inquiry can be impartial. Earlier on Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said ""excessive"" numbers of civilians were being killed in disproportionate air and artillery strikes carried out by all sides to the conflict. The ICRC has repeatedly warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, and now expects cholera cases to reach 900,000 by the end of this year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lord Heseltine defends decision to vote for Lib Dems,"The ex-deputy PM said he would not back the Tories in this week's vote because of its pro-Brexit stance. This has led to calls that he should be expelled from the party. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said backing another party broke Tory rules while his colleague Conor Burns said ""discipline needs to be enforced"". The UK will take part in the elections for the European Parliament on 23 May after the government was unable to agree a Brexit deal. Lord Heseltine's revelation that he would be voting for the Liberal Democrats, disclosed in an article for the Sunday Times, has angered Tory Brexiteers. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 live, Mr Bridgen said: ""Lord Heseltine - in promoting voting for a non-Conservative candidate in an election where Conservative candidates are standing - is in breach of our party rules."" ""I find Lord Heseltine's arrogance that he knows better than the majority of the electorate really quite breathtaking. ""There really is no place for someone with his views in the Conservative Party."" But the 86 year-old, who served in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major and was an adviser to David Cameron, said he would resist any attempts to force him out of the party. He told 5 live: ""I said quite clearly that I'm lending my support to the Liberal Democrat candidate. ""I'm not going to leave the Conservative Party and I'm not going to resign the Conservative whip - that's where my natural home is. ""But I'm not prepared to indulge in this act of national sacrifice by voting for Brexit."" 'Great sadness' He said he would be backing the candidate in his constituency that seemed the most likely to stop Brexit - which was a former Conservative MEP who was now standing for the Lib Dems. It would be ""a great sadness"" for him if he was expelled from the party, he said, but he would continue to support Tory policies. ""People should vote for the national interest,"" he added. ""They should decide what they think is best for this country. ""This is not a matter of rules. It's a matter of conscience."" It is not the first time Lord Heseltine has been at odds with his party over Brexit. In March 2017 he was sacked as a government adviser after rebelling in a Brexit vote in the House of Lords. The UK is legally obliged to take part in this week's European elections, which happens every five years in EU countries, after it failed to approve a withdrawal agreement by 22 May.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Wales Bill 'being rammed through' Parliament, says academic","The bill, which will give the Senedd new powers, has been revised amid worries it may reduce assembly powers. But Prof Richard Wyn Jones said it had ""serious problems"" and he was sure AMs ""would consider blocking the bill"". On Friday, the Wales Office said discussions with the Welsh Government would continue. The Wales Bill has already been debated in the House of Commons and is now being considered by the House of Lords as part of the process of the law entering the statute book. The committee stage of the proposed law's passage through the House of Lords is due to start on Monday. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, Prof Jones said the bill was not fit for purpose as it did not ""fulfil the original intentions of settling devolution"". ""It is genuinely hard to find people who aren't directly involved on the UK government side with a good word to say about this legislation, certainly in terms of the detail,"" he said. ""What was striking, we did have a consensus, an all-party consensus, in terms of moving to a reserved powers model. ""What's particularly depressing is, in the enactments of that good intention, we've reached a stage where everybody who is looking at this in a relatively dispassionate way is pointing to some fundamental problems. ""I don't think that anybody is going into this wanting it to fail, in terms of the critics. This is the only piece of legislation on the table, there is a sense the status quo is unsatisfactory and so people want this to work. ""There have been lots of constructive suggestions for change from the Welsh Government, from the National Assembly presiding office, and yet the legislation is being rammed through Parliament with, so far, only very small changes being conceded."" Prof Jones said the Wales Office had been ""very consultative,"" but it was ""a very small cog in the Whitehall machine"" and did not have the ""institutional heft to force other more powerful departments into a more sensible position"". He added he hoped to see ""serious movement"" by the UK government on the reservations list. First Minster Carwyn Jones has expressed ""considerable concern"" a number of issues have not been resolved, including addressing those around a Welsh legal jurisdiction and the number and breadth of reservations. The Lords Constitution Committee also suggested the bill could create a ""recipe for confusion"" and could lead to more Welsh bills ending up in the courts. On Friday, a Wales Office spokesman said: ""The Wales Bill provides a historic opportunity for the Welsh Assembly to secure more powers and create a stronger, clearer, fairer devolution settlement for Wales. ""Discussions will continue with the Welsh Government as the bill goes through Parliament and there will be plenty of opportunity to debate further amendments over the coming weeks.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Girl guides call for airbrushed photos to be labelled,"Liz Burnley, of Girlguiding UK, said ""unobtainable ideals"" affected young girls ""badly"", and urged the government to introduce compulsory labelling. A Girlguiding poll of 1,109 girls found 50% of those aged 16 to 21 consider having surgery to change their looks. Some 42% of 11 to 16-year-olds admitted watching what they ate. Ms Burnley said: ""We know how profoundly they feel the pressure to conform to a particular body image and how badly they can be affected by these unobtainable ideals. ""We are proud to support the calls of our members who believe that it is time that the prime minister addressed their concerns and acted in the interests of girls and young women across the country."" Some 20,000 Guides currently taking part in an annual camp in West Yorkshire are being encouraged to sign a petition calling for David Cameron to introduce a law forcing magazines to inform readers when photographs have been airbrushed. Body confidence boost Susan Ringwood, of eating disorder charity Beat, said they were committed to working with Girlguiding UK to make ""this important call to action a reality"". ""Young people with eating disorders tell us that being surrounded everyday by pictures of unnaturally 'perfect' bodies makes their own recovery so much more difficult to achieve,"" she said. ""We know the difference it would make to all young people's self-esteem and body confidence if they could be sure which of the images they see are natural and true to life."" Singer Javine Hylton backed the campaign, saying girls ""needed to learn to be confident with their bodies"". ""They need to cherish themselves from their heads to their tip-toes, embracing both their beauty and their flaws,"" she said. Last month, Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said she wanted to see an end to airbrushing, or the introduction of a kitemark to indicate where images have been altered. But she said she had ""no desire to impose regulation or restriction on advertisers or others"", and hoped they would make changes to their practices on a voluntary basis. The Girls' Attitudes survey was carried out online in July 2009 and included both Girlguiding members and non-members.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Nurses' leaders urge 'care for those who caring',"By Naomi GrimleyGlobal affairs correspondent The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is calling for better risk assessments; working patterns and mental health care for those on the front line. It warns many may be suffering from exhaustion, anxiety and other psychological problems. The Department of Health and Social Care said support was a ""top priority"". The RCN has released an eight-point plan of commitments it wants to see enforced to mark the 100 days since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. Amongst its suggestions are a better Covid-19 testing regime for healthcare workers and more attention paid to the risks posed to ethnic minority nurses. It says employers and ministers ""must tackle the underlying causes which have contributed to worse outcomes for Bame staff"". The RCN also wants a commitment that no nurses will be pressured into working if they do not feel they have the right personal protective equipment for their jobs. And it wants more done too to avoid long shifts and excess hours as well as measures to protect annual leave and work breaks. Above all, the union is asking for proper funding for the mental health counselling that may be needed to support staff who've had traumatic experiences on Covid-19 wards and in care homes. It points out even those who work in other areas may be affected by work-related stress as backlogs from disrupted services mount up. Anxiety and PTSD Last month, an Icon/ King's College London survey of members of the nursing and midwifery workforce found that 88% continue to worry about risks to family members during the pandemic. Respondents also reported ongoing depression, anxiety, stress and emerging signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Dame Donna Kinnair, the RCN's general secretary, said: ""The weekly clapping may have stopped, but the practical measures needed to fully support our health care staff are only just beginning. ""It is vital that our governments and employers, including the NHS, take steps now to protect our health and social care services and staff, who have done such remarkable work at a time of crisis."" The Department of Health and Social Care said the whole country recognised the ""bravery of everyone working on the frontline of this unprecedented global pandemic"" and it would ""continue to do everything we can to support them, including ensuring that their mental health and wellbeing is a top priority"". It said all NHS staff have free access to helplines and wellbeing apps, and urged anyone struggling to call them, or speak to a colleague or their occupational health team. During the peak of the epidemic in the UK, many commentators said there should be a ""never again"" approach to the health service and social care sector - similar to the founding of the welfare state following WW2. But the medical professional bodies worry that society will return normal without the support they say is crucial for healthcare staff.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Crime: Just 1% of magistrates under 30 in Wales,"It comes as the charity for magistrates calls for more young people to take up the justice roles. The Magistrates Association wants to address the age imbalance which means only 10 of the 997 magistrates are under 30. Chairwoman Bev Higgs said young people had ""a unique perspective on what it's like to live in today's world"". Magistrate Thomas Tudor Jones, 29, said he had ""never sat on the bench with anyone close to my age"". Mr Jones, of Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been a magistrate for a year and said ""the spark for applying"" came after seeing an interview with a magistrate on TV saying more young people were needed. He said he was not surprised at the lack of younger magistrates, saying: ""since I've been sitting I've never sat on the bench with anyone the same age as me, or anyone close to my age"". As well as a lack of under-30s, only 41 magistrates are aged 30 to 40 and 138 are aged 40 to 50. Almost half of the 997 total are aged 60 or over - and magistrates must retire from the bench at 70. The Magistrates Association chair told BBC Radio Cymru it was ""disappointing"" there was not a better age balance. She said research had shown that the more diverse a magistrates' bench was, the better the decisions were made. Ms Higgs said it was ""vital that much more is done to attract young applicants to the magistracy"" so people knew about the vacancies and what the job entails. She added: ""Obviously an 18-year-old's perspective or even anybody in their 20s or 30s is going to be quite different than anyone older. ""That age group would have an unique perspective on what it's like to live in today's world. I remember when I joined the magistracy, I had to explain to a much older magistrate what lightsaber was. ""It's that kind of cultural reference that sometimes pops up in court that young people or even people with young children or young adults in the household will pick up on, that perhaps an older age group might not."" According to Llanelli solicitor Gareth Jones, some defendants do notice a difference if the magistrate is of a similar age to them ""The chair of the bench is meant to talk with the defendant and ask why they've done something - why they've stolen something, why they've punched someone - and they're trying to understand the reason why the person has come to court,"" said Mr Jones. ""When I talk with defendants before and after they've been in court, some say that the chair was nice, was lovely, but others say that 'the person up there, in his 60s, is talking to me like I'm a child and they don't understand what I've been through'"". The Ministry of Justice said: ""We are investing around £1m to encourage people from all backgrounds into the magistracy, including those from more diverse and younger groups.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Racism protests do not get to the root of the problem',"By Angie BrownBBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Qasim Lozano, 27, said microaggressions that were more subtle and less blatant forms of racism had to be stamped out first. The death of George Floyd in the US has triggered mass anti-racism protests. Mr Lozano told BBC Scotland about his experiences of growing up in Edinburgh. 'Systematic racism' He said: ""Over the last couple of weeks, the topic of systematic racism has been brought to the forefront as a result of police brutality in the US. ""It warms my heart to see so many people out there publicly supporting a cause that is very dear to me. ""However, some of the people who have been protesting, sharing black squares and uploading a barrage of posts against racism appear to be completely oblivious to the fact that they could have contributed to this problem."" The former Leith Academy pupil said when he was at school he saw people treating his friend's afro like a toy, putting things in it and even setting it on fire. For his best friend, who is black African, the racial microaggression came in the form of people telling him to rap or beatbox, mock the way his lips or nose looked, comparing him to every other black person, telling him to say particular phrases and telling him to imitate other black people in popular culture, primarily in music and movies. Mr Lozano said when he scored two goals in his team's football final, his coach was buying the team pints and asked if he was allowed one because he presumed he might have a religion that banned alcohol consumption. The Edinburgh Napier University business graduate said: ""The reality is racism is woven deep into the very fabric of British culture and society. ""We rarely witness police beating up and shooting black men here in Edinburgh. ""In the few cases where we observe someone being explicitly and overtly racist, most people will acknowledge and agree that it is wrong."" He added: ""But I want to talk about the form of racism I have endured throughout my whole life. ""The most prevalent and pervasive form of racism that goes without acknowledgement here, racial microaggression."" He said he would rather people looked at themselves and how others around them acted before taking to the streets or social media to protest about racism. He said: ""To make any real long lasting changes, you have to take a step back and look deep into yourself, into your past, into your way of thinking, into the way you act and ask: What should I have done differently? What could I have done differently? ""People need to think the next time they witness someone make a racist micro-aggression, will they only act if it offends the victim? ""And if it does offend the victim? Will they let people laugh it off as a joke?"" He said he would like the education curriculum in schools revised so that microaggressions could be highlighted and tackled.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Male voice choirs face 'existential threat',"By Huw ThomasBBC Wales arts and media correspondent The body representing more than 90 Welsh choirs said social distancing rules and fears about members' safety posed an ""existential threat"". Beaufort Male Choir has begun rehearsing outdoors in a rugby club stand to ensure their safety. But the choir's secretary said restrictions needed to be relaxed to allow safe rehearsals indoors. Male voice choirs have long been symbolic of Wales' cultural heritage and epitomise its reputation as a land of song. Since lockdown was announced in March, all choirs have had their rehearsals and concerts cancelled. It has led to a loss of income for some, but all have missed the social activity that came with weekly rehearsals and tours. Chris Evans is secretary of the Beaufort Male Choir in Ebbw Vale and is also secretary of the Welsh Association of Male Choirs (WAMC). He said: ""It's an existential issue for some. One, the demographics in choirs and in male choirs are quite old. So it means that there will be choristers who don't want to sing again. ""And if you're only a small choir and 50% of you decide they don't want to do it again, that means that existence is a challenge."" He added some choirs were struggling for venues in which to practise, and choirs had lost money over the summer. Beaufort Male Choir rehearsed last week for the first time since March in the stand at Ebbw Vale RFC, so the men could socially distance. During lockdown the choir had been unable to rehearse, but members had been practising at home with recorded instructional videos from its musical director. Mr Evans said rehearsals at the rugby ground had been an emotional reunion: The first song that they sang last week was [the Welsh hymn] Gwahoddiad. ""I wasn't singing because I was running the mask store, but it brought tears to the eyes... it was brilliant to sing again."" The Welsh Association of Male Choirs surveyed its members about the pandemic and its report said: President of Beaufort Male Choir, Labour's Member of the Senedd for Blaenau Gwent Alun Davies, wants better guidance on rehearsals that would enable safe indoor practice sessions over the winter. ""There is nobody here who wants to break rules, and there is nobody here who wants to see people become ill as a consequence of what I am suggesting. ""But what we are looking at is having an element of normality that will be especially important as we face a winter, and those long dark cold months."" Despite concerns for the future, the WMAC said 50% of the choirs it surveyed had begun booking concerts for 2021. In the meantime, it said efforts were ongoing to keep in touch with members and encourage virtual rehearsals.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Full Sutton 'super prison': Police object to plans,"Plans have been recommended for approval by East Riding Council for a £91m Category C jail near an existing high-security prison in Full Sutton. But Ch Supt Phil Ward from Humberside Police said the prison would create an estimated 250 more crimes each year. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had carried out impact assessments. It said in a statement: ""We commissioned all the appropriate impact assessments required for the planning process using the standard methodologies. ""These included traffic, environmental, and public service impact reports which have been submitted to the local authority."" Ch Supt Ward said: ""Comparisons with similar sized Category B prisons to that proposed in the planning application show recorded criminal offences to be circa 250 per year, the majority of which (circa 150) are recorded violence offences. ""These offences require investigation which will place significant additional demand on Humberside Police."" The MOJ said they were not aware of any evidence that shows the risk of crime increases around areas with prisons in them. As well as a rise in crime, however, Ch Supt Ward also cited concerns over the impact on the community and transport network. He added that the village of Full Sutton ""already suffers from significant non-village traffic flow due to the current prison facility"" and ""insufficient public transport to mitigate the anticipated traffic flow increase"". The existing prison - HMP Full Sutton - is a maximum security prison for men in Category A and Category B. It has a capacity of about 500 male inmates. The new facility proposed by the MoJ would house 1,440 inmates. Category C prisons are training and resettlement prisons, which allow inmates the opportunity to integrate back into the community on release. Objections have also been received from more than 2,000 members of the public and protests have been held over the plans. Dozens of people gathered to protest in March, saying the area would be unable to cope with the extra traffic and it would make the area less desirable.

"Lloyds Bank and Pizza Hut cut more than 1,000 jobs","Lloyds said it was cutting 865 jobs in areas such as insurance and wealth management as it revived plans to restructure the business. Separately, Pizza Hut is planning to close 29 restaurants with the loss of 450 jobs. The restaurant chain said it was part of a rescue deal ""to mitigate the financial impact of Covid-19"". A raft of businesses have announced jobs cuts and closures as consumer demand has dried up during the crisis. British employers planned more than 300,000 redundancies in June and July alone, as the country slipped into its sharpest recession on record. Lloyds, which has about 65,000 employees, had warned of cuts in January but put them hold until the autumn due to the crisis. While it is cutting posts, it also said it would create 226 roles and would try to redeploy people. However, the Unite union said that it was worried about employees entering a jobs market ""during very challenging times"". ""The pandemic has demonstrated the amazing resilience and flexibility of this workforce,"" said Unite national officer Rob MacGregor. ""The employer should not focus solely on cutting jobs and costs but instead the bank should invest in a workforce that has only shown loyalty, dedication and hard work through the good times, and the bad."" 'Difficult time' Pizza Hut said it had faced ""significant disruption"" from the pandemic and would have to close 29 of its 244 UK restaurants. It did not say which sites would close. It said the planned cuts would leave it with 5,000 employees. ""Despite a quick, Covid-safe reopening, sales are not expected to fully bounce back until well into 2021,"" it said. ""We understand this is a difficult time for everyone involved,"" it added. Hospitality has been one of the sectors hardest hit by the crisis, despite restaurants and pubs getting a boost in August from the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme. A growing list of restaurant chains have had to announce closures in recent months including Pizza Express, Byron Burger and Frankie & Benny's-owner the Restaurant Group. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India tobacco firms halt production over health warning,"From 1 December tobacco firms must carry a graphic image of a mouth with cancer on all their packs in India. ITC and Godfrey Phillips India say they are unclear over the pictures they should be using, but the health ministry denies there is any confusion. It says the firms must use the new warnings immediately or face penalties. India has about 120 million smokers and the government says smoking kills nearly a million people a year. Earlier warnings of an infected lung and a scorpion sign on tobacco packaging are seen as having been too mild to be effective. How much impact the new warning will have remains to be seen. BBC correspondents say India has very high sales of cigarettes purchased singly, which reduces the impact of pictorial warnings as many smokers never actually see them. Anti-smoking activists say sales of cigarettes are more affected by price rises and taxation than by pictorial health warnings. 'Ambiguity' ITC and Godfrey Phillips India say they stopped production at all their units on Thursday. ""Units [for making cigarettes] are shut because of the ambiguity in pictorial warnings to be carried from 1 December onwards,"" the Press Trust of India news agency quoted an ITC spokesman as saying. ITC makes popular cigarette brands such as India Kings, Gold Flake and Navy Cut. Output is on hold at all five of its units across India, PTI said. An official at Godfrey Phillips - which makes brands like Four Square, Red and White and Cavanders - said work had stopped at its two India units. A health ministry spokesman told the BBC that the image of a cancer-stricken mouth had been in its notification to tobacco companies of 5 March 2010 and there is no reason for confusion. The government order on the new pictorial warnings has faced stiff resistance from tobacco manufacturers and the deadline for implementing it has been postponed a couple of times. In the past few years, India has come up with stringent rules to curb the use of tobacco. Tobacco-related advertisements are banned and the sale of tobacco products to minors is also an offence. A countrywide ban on smoking in public places came into effect two years ago - although correspondents say it is blatantly flouted and poorly enforced.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bournemouth surf reef boss Tony Williams in chief exec appointment,"Tony Williams, the current executive director for environment and economy, is set to replace Pam Donnellan who is retiring at the end of March. The Unison union has questioned his performance over the £3.2m reef which has been dogged with problems. But the council said he proved himself during a tough interview process. Mr Williams has been the lead officer on the surf reef project which opened late and over budget in November 2009. Those behind the project faced criticism for the overspend and delay, and also over the failure of the reef to produce the right waves. It has been closed since March after two of the giant sandbags were damaged by a boat. Mr Williams will be earning almost exactly the same salary as the outgoing chief executive. He will face the challenge of reducing costs at the Conservative-led authority, which is seeking to make spending cuts of £9.2m in 2011/12. As part of the proposals, the council is looking to transfer staff from its human resources and finance departments to support services company Mouchel. The authority said it would take into account the firm's annual losses of £64.8m, which it posted on Wednesday, before making a decision. 'Tough times' Dave Higgins, from Unison, said: ""I can imagine there will be concern from some councillors and the public about his performance on the reef, so it will be interesting to see what will happen. ""My main concern is with the outsourcing; I hope he will look at it objectively as a lot of staff will be affected."" Mr Williams said he was ready for the challenges ahead while the council has defended his record over the reef, citing major regeneration the scheme has brought to Boscombe. He added: ""My priorities... will be working with members on key issues for the town, including continuing to regenerate Boscombe. ""The next five years will be difficult for local government. ""In Bournemouth we have already planned for the tough times ahead, but I will not be complacent."" Mr Williams's appointment is still subject to checks and ratification by full council on 6 December.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greene King pub giant snapped up by Hong Kong firm CKA,"Suffolk-based Greene King owns roughly 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels in total across the UK. The deal values Greene King at £2.7bn. The move comes just months after Fuller's, the brewer whose beers include London Pride, sold its entire drinks business to Japan's biggest brewer Asahi. And last month, pub group Stonegate Pub, which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, announced it was buying rival Ei Group - once known as Enterprise Inns - for £1.3bn. Greene King chief executive Nick Mackenzie said CKA shared ""many of Greene King's business philosophies"". ""They understand the strengths of our business and we welcome their commitment to working with the existing management team, evolving the strategy and investing in the business to ensure its continued long-term growth,"" he added. Greene King's directors said the terms of the deal were ""fair and reasonable"" and that they would unanimously recommend it to shareholders who will get the final vote on the tie-up. Shares in Greene King surged more than 50% after the deal was announced. Bad for customers? Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said while the deal was good news for shareholders, it was likely to be bad news for Greene King's customers. ""I think we can comfortably expect more pub closures. It's a whopping [price] that implies CKA sees significant value in the property portfolio,"" he said. In its statement, Greene King said CKA had no plans to make ""material changes"" to group and management staff numbers and did not intend to ""initiate any material headcount reductions within the Greene King organisation as a result of the acquisition."" A combination of rising cost pressures and people spending less on going out has led to a wave of pub closures. Last year nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut, according to property firm Altus Group. Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) has said more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general. Meanwhile, pubs have faced a ""triple whammy"" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates. Mr Wilson said the properties that pubs owned was making the sector attractive to investors. ""Greene King owns the freehold or long leasehold on 81% of its properties. The company recently carried out a revaluation of its property estate that indicated a market value of £4.5bn against the £3.5bn book value,"" he said. CKA was founded by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-Shing, whose business empire spans retail, telecoms and power firms. Mr Li retired from leading the firm last year. He was ranked 28th in this year's Forbes rich list. He started work sweeping factory floors as a young boy, but subsequently became one of the first Hong Kong tycoons to invest in mainland China, with property playing a big part in his wealth.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Hundreds of staff injured at Amazon UK warehouses, GMB claims","GMB union numbers show 240 reports of serious injury or near misses were sent to the Health and Safety Executive last year, and 622 over three years. Amazon is currently running a TV advertising campaign highlighting contented staff. It said critics were determined to present a ""false picture"". The GMB obtained the figures via Freedom of Information requests. For injuries to be included in the figures they need to be serious enough to stop a worker performing their normal duties for at least seven days, or be on a list including fractures, amputation, crushing, scalping or burning. In one London warehouse a worker lost consciousness and appeared to stop breathing after injuring their head, the GMB said. In Manchester, one worker got caught in a gate and fractured their hand. The data shows the number of reports to the HSE has increased every year, from 152 in the 2017 financial year to 240 in 2019. However the figures deal with a period during which the number of warehouses run by Amazon more than doubled from 10 in 2015 to 22 today. Mick Rix, GMB national officer, said: ""Amazon are spending millions on PR campaigns trying to persuade people its warehouses are great places to work. But the facts are there for all to see - things are getting worse. ""Hundreds of stricken Amazon workers are needing urgent medical attention. Conditions are hellish. We've tried over and over again to get Amazon to talk to us to try and improve safety for workers. But enough is enough - it's now time for a full parliamentary inquiry."" In December, GMB and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were joined by members of the shadow cabinet for a demonstration outside Amazon's London offices. The unions and politicians said that Amazon should be paying millions more in taxes, claims denied by the online giant. A spokesman for Amazon said: ""Amazon is a safe place to work. Yet again, our critics seem determined to paint a false picture of what it's like to work for Amazon. They repeat the same sensationalised allegations time and time again. ""Our doors are open to the public, to politicians, and indeed to anyone who truly wants to see the modern, innovate and, most importantly, safe environment we provide to our people.""

India lion cub leads guard to its mother's corpse,"By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi A forest guard, who saw the cub hiding in the bushes, followed it and went on to discover the body on a nearby hill. The cub then guarded his mother until the ranger returned with forest and police officials to remove the carcass. A post-mortem suggests the lioness died in a fight with other animals, possibly a herd of water buffalo. Deputy Conservator of Forests in Gir, Anshuman Sharma, said the cub's behaviour was ""rare"" and ""very peculiar"" - something he had not encountered in his many years of watching lions. Gir in Gujarat state is home to Asiatic lions and, according to the last census done in 2010, there are 411 lions in the sanctuary. ""On Saturday afternoon, I was patrolling the Tulsi-Shyam range of the sanctuary when I saw a cub hiding in the bushes,"" forest guard Rana Mori told the BBC. Such small cubs are never found alone, they are generally accompanied by their mother and Mr Mori says he started looking for the lioness. ""I followed the cub which led me to its mother's body lying on a small hillock. The mother was called Rupa [the beautiful one]. It initially looked like she was sleeping, but when it didn't move, I prodded it with my stick. That's when I discovered that the lioness was dead,"" he said. When Mr Mori returned with a team of officials to remove the carcass, they found the cub still sitting near the body. The lioness, who was about 11 years old, had broken ribs and internal injuries and died from a haemorrhage, Mr Sharma said. Lion expert Yadvendra Dev Jhala of the Wildlife Institute of India told the BBC that he had never heard of a similar incident involving a lion cub. But he says that in Gir there has been very little conflict with humans and ""lions generally know their individual guards well"". Mr Sharma says lions are known for their social behaviour: ""They are not like dogs, they won't shake paws or wag tails, but we believe they recognise guards they see every day."" Wildlife officials say cubs are totally dependent on their mothers for survival until the age of two-and-a-half to three years. The cub, only 15 months old, is now under the constant observation of forest officials. ""Its mother, Rupa, seemed to be a loner who lived and hunted alone, But now that the lioness is gone, we expect the cub to join another group, or another lioness may start looking after it,"" Mr Sharma said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Grenfell inquiry: 'My family are all dead', boy told fire officer","Glynn Williams, who co-ordinated 999 call information at the scene of the fire, described struggling to keep track of who had been helped to safety. In a statement, he said communication with some residents was difficult as some were ""too traumatised"". He added the events had a ""massive emotional impact"" on him. Mr Williams's statement described how he had been handed slips of paper with information provided by residents during their 999 calls. He wrote the details on a wall in the foyer of Grenfell Tower and was attempting to confirm people's identities as they left the building. ""At times I would ask the casualties themselves as they walked past, but communication was difficult as they were either too traumatised to speak or unable to understand due to the language barrier,"" he said. ""There was a woman carrying a little boy. As the woman walked past me crying, I asked them where the rest of their family were, to which the little boy said: 'All dead'."" Later in the night a station manager sent across a new list with details of every person they knew of who still needed rescuing. Mr Williams wrote: ""There were far more numbers on the second list. This clearly showed there was a breakdown in communication."" 'Eyes wide open' The fire in North Kensington, west London, killed 72 people on 14 June last year. Mr Williams also told of how firefighters gave their helmets to children. One girl was alone and in her pyjamas as she was being carried out of the building by a fire fighter, Mr Williams, an officer of 18 years' service based at Fulham Fire Station, said. ""She looked to be in shock as her eyes were wide open. To protect her from the falling debris, I gave her my helmet before the firefighter carried her out the main entrance."" He added: ""Shortly after the incident I started to feel really angry that I did not go in and rescue someone. When I was asleep I started to have visualisations of the little girl's face who I had given my helmet to."" Mr Williams acknowledged crews had not received training about safely rescuing someone through ""a toxic environment 20-plus floors high"". He said the absence of a working fire lift meant rescue teams clogged a single stairwell and this ""prevented their ability to fight the fire and conduct rescues"". The foyer of Grenfell Tower became ""heavily congested with fire fighters and casualties"", Mr Williams said. He said being told it was too dangerous to commit rescue crews above the 10th floor ""was difficult for me to hear and I expressed my dissatisfaction"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Six-month delay' for Heathrow decision,"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Senior sources very close to the process have told the BBC that there needs to be more ""confidence building"" about the environmental impact of a new runway at Heathrow, if the government backs it. And that means yet another review. And that expansion at Gatwick will not be ruled out. One source told me that keeping both options on the table means that the airport operators can have their feet ""held to the fire"" over dealing with environmental concerns. That may mean demanding that Heathrow bans staff from driving to work. Or saying that all ""airside"" vehicles (that is vehicles that operate within the airport's perimeter) have to be electric. The government also wants to be able to force more money out of Heathrow or Gatwick - if either are given the go-ahead - to pay compensation to local people who are affected. Keeping both options on the table increases the government's leverage. 'Barrage of criticism' The decision that there will be yet another delay is likely to go down very badly with businesses which have demanded that the government ""get on"" with expanding Britain's aviation capacity. But the politics of this decision appears to have held sway. David Cameron is still concerned that any decision to back Heathrow will put his ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge in 2009 that there will be no third runway at Heathrow in sharp relief. And that he will face a barrage of criticism that he is not a man of his word. Further, if a decision is not taken until next summer, that means it will come after the election for the next mayor of London, which is in May. Which is convenient, given that the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, is implacably opposed to Heathrow expansion. As is the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan. More delays The decision on the new environmental review is set to be taken by the Economic and Domestic Cabinet sub-committee on Thursday, which the prime minister chairs. And it's likely to be announced on the same day. Of course, we are still three days away from that committee meeting and, as with all things Heathrow (and, frankly, government on issues of aviation policy) things could change. The meeting was initially due to be held last week but was derailed by the crisis in Syria. It was only a week ago that most were predicting a favourable outcome for Heathrow, including the airport itself. That now appears to have been over-optimistic. More delays are ahead.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Parkinson's stem cell 'breakthrough',"They said their study on rats heralded a ""huge breakthrough"" towards developing effective treatments. There is no cure for the disease, but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms. Parkinson's UK said there were many questions still to be answered before human trials could proceed. The disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine ,which helps to control mood and movement. To simulate Parkinson's, Lund University researchers killed dopamine-producing neurons on one side of the rats' brains. They then converted human embryonic stem cells into neurons that produced dopamine. These were injected into the rats' brains, and the researchers found evidence that the damage was reversed. There have been no human clinical trials of stem-cell-derived neurons, but the researchers said they could be ready for testing by 2017. Malin Parmar, associate professor of developmental and regenerative neurobiology, said: ""It's a huge breakthrough in the field [and] a stepping stone towards clinical trials."" A similar method has been tried in a limited number of patients. It involved taking brain tissue from multiple aborted foetuses to heal the brain. Clinical trials were abandoned after mixed results, but about a third of the patients had foetal brain cells that functioned for 25 years. Using embryonic stem cells may be preferable, as it is easier to get hold of the large numbers of cells needed for transplant by growing them in the laboratory. It also opens up the possibility of using less ethically charged sources of stem cells, such as those made from adult tissue. The charity Parkinson's UK said the research ""could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinson's"". Its director of research and development, Arthur Roach, said: ""This important research is a key step along the way in helping us to understand how stem cells might shape future Parkinson's treatments. ""There are important potential advantages of these cells over the foetal-derived cells used in past cell transplantation work. ""This study could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with Parkinson's but there are still many questions that need to be answered before this development can be tested in people with the condition.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook facial recognition faces class-action suit,"The lawsuit alleges that Facebook gathered biometric information without users' explicit consent. It involves the ""tag suggestions"" technology, which spots users' friends in uploaded photos. The lawsuit says this breaches Illinois state law. Facebook said the case had no merit and it would fight it vigorously. However in his order, US District Judge James Donato wrote that Facebook seemed to believe individual lawsuits would be preferable to a class action ""because statutory damages could amount to billions of dollars"". 'Face templates' On Monday, Judge Donato ruled to certify a class of Facebook users - a key legal hurdle for a class action suit. In a successful class action suit, any person in that group could be entitled to compensation. The class of people in question is made up of Facebook users ""in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after 7 June 2011,"" according to the court order. The decision comes days after Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced intensive questioning by US lawmakers over the company's collection and use of user data. He is also due to meet European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip in San Francisco this week, reports Bloomberg. What does the facial recognition do? June 2011 was the date on which Facebook rolled out its ""tag suggestions"" feature. The feature suggests who might be present in uploaded photos, based on an existing database of faces. In Judge Donato's ruling, he laid out the four-step process behind the technology: On its help pages, Facebook says the face templates are made from information about the similarities in every photo the user has been tagged in. ""If you've never been tagged in a photo on Facebook or have untagged yourself in all photos of you on Facebook, then we do not have this summary information for you,"" the company says. The feature is not available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users. In December 2017 Facebook announced that users would be notified if a picture of them was uploaded by someone else, even if they hadn't been tagged in it. Due to privacy regulations, this feature would not be available in Europe or Canada, the firm said at the time.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
A Bafta bruising for the Brits?,"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter But behind the glitz and the glamour, behind the gongs and the speeches, behind the seemingly endless parade of beards, lies a highly-competitive international movie business, in which the stakes are high, there is no time for losers and second chances are rare (hence the 'phew and thanks' nature of Ben Affleck's speech). The awards season, which climaxes with the Oscars on Sunday, 24 February, is but a part of the meticulously planned global PR campaign devised by the movie moguls and interested parties to coax you and me from our sofas and into the cinema. And there are few parties more interested in this country than those seeking to encourage filmmakers to come here to make their movies. Sir Alan Parker, recipient of Sunday's Bafta Fellowship, had barely sat down before the Scottish Government had sent out an email with the heading ""Bafta Success For Scotland On Screen"". It went on to say that ""this has been a spectacular 12 months for Scotland on film, with movies such as Brave, Skyfall, Prometheus and the Dark Knight Rises showcasing Scotland as a magnificent location"". An email from Amanda Nevill, the boss of the British Film Institute - the quango responsible for government investment in British film, was rather more muted. She said ""Britain was well represented"" among the winners, before gearing up a bit for Skyfall, which she described as ""a most British of Bonds"" that is ""doing so much to showcase the UK's talent, skills and stunning locations to audiences across the globe"". You can sense her disappointment. The Irish / British actor Daniel Day-Lewis was the only home winner in the Bafta's big six categories (best film, best director, lead actor, lead actress, supporting actor, supporting actress), and that was in a US film. UK talent shortlisted for these awards for their efforts in Les Miserables, Skyfall and Hitchcock all failed to bring home the British bacon. It sums up 2012 for the British film industry, which has not been particularly great. We're doing our bit and going to the cinema in vast numbers (172.5 million visits, the second highest number of admissions in decade), but the international movie industry is letting the side down. Inward investment into UK-based film production dropped by a worrying 29%, which inevitably led to fewer British films going into production, down from 238 in 2011, to just 159 in 2012. Those figures might be an anomaly due to the way in which the stats are gathered, which means that a big movie such as Skyfall (which fell into the 2011 figures) can skew the numbers disproportionately. But as a spokeswoman for the BFI told me yesterday it is a ""worry"" and could signal ""a downward trend"". If that was to be the case, it is likely questions would be raised regarding the government's decision to close the apparently successful and overtly commercial UK Film Council, and instead place the future of British film with the more cerebral BFI.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jordan Begley Taser death: Mother saw 'fear in his face',"Jordan Begley, 23, died in hospital two hours after he was shot by a police officer in Gorton, Manchester following a row with neighbours on 10 July 2013. Manchester Civil Courts of Justice heard he was Tasered and struck by officers while being restrained. The inquest is scheduled to last five weeks. Row in street PC Terence Donnelly, the officer said to have fired the stun gun at him, is expected to give evidence along with four other serving Greater Manchester Police officers: PCs Dave Graham, Christopher Mills, Peter Fox and Andrew Wright, The jury heard Mr Begley was not holding a knife or weapon when the stun gun was fired at him from a distance of 70cm (27ins). Mr Begley, who worked in an ice cream factory, had been accused of stealing a neighbour's handbag and a row developed in the street before he went back inside the house he shared with his mother, the court heard. His mother called police as her son, a heavy drinker who also used cocaine, was threatening to get a knife, the inquest heard. This resulted in a ""Grade One"" police response with a number of officers responding to the call to the family's home on Beard Road. Mrs Begley was asked by an officer to go inside and remove their dog. Nigel Meadows, Coroner for Manchester, reading from an opening address to the jury, said Mrs Begley saw her son in the dining room of the house and, ""noticed his hands by his side and the officer had drawn his Taser and was pointing it at his heart"". 'Final warning' She recalled seeing laser lights in his eyes, the court heard. ""The officer was saying in a loud voice, words to the effect, 'This is your third and final warning! Step back!' ""She could see the fear in Jordan's face. He was not saying anything to the officers."" The court heard Mr Begley was hit twice with the Taser then resisted arrest as officers struggled to handcuff him. He was hit twice with ""distraction strikes"", the court heard. After being handcuffed, Mr Begley's breathing changed to ""abnormal"" and another officer who entered the room noticed a bump over his right eye and a carpet burn on his face, the inquest heard. Mr Begley became ""unresponsive"", was treated with a defibrillator and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Shortly after arriving at Manchester Royal Infirmary, Mrs Begley was told her son was dead. Mr Meadows told the jury a police officer must ultimately be able to justify the use of physical force and that it was ""lawful, reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances"". The inquest continued with jurors being taken to Mr Begley's house where he was shot with the Taser.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
MPs criticise government's railway plan,"The Rail Command Paper , published in March this year, sets out the government's vision for the railways. The Early Day Motion, tabled by Labour MP John McDonnell with cross-party support, urged the government to run the railway as a ""public service"". The government said its plan was to reduce the cost of running the railway. The plan ""will worsen passenger services through the loss of thousands of frontline workers from trains, stations, ticket offices, safety-critical infrastructure and operational roles"", the MPs warned. It would also ""result in higher fares"", cut services and ""more crowded trains"". TUC research, also carried out in March, said fare prices were rising ""despite a 50% decline in investment by train operating companies in the railway network over the last five years"". The research found more money being spent on back office functions like IT, and the funds for tracks and signals ""reduced from £105m in 2006-07 to zero last year"", it said. Its deputy general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""MPs from across the political spectrum are voicing the concerns of thousands of their constituents who feel ripped off by private train operators who inflict heavy fare rises while cutting staff on trains and stations and keeping investment in decent facilities on trains and stations to a minimum."" 'Passenger experience' Bob Crow, leader of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: ""This government has learnt nothing from the tragedies of the past and is allowing the profiteers to bleed the railways of desperately needed investment while creating the perfect conditions for another Hatfield or Potters Bar."" Rail minister Theresa Villiers said the government's plan was ""to reduce the cost of running the railway by £3.5bn per annum by 2019"". The minister said funds were allocated for ""thousands of new carriages across the country, electrifying swathes of the rail network, and redeveloping many of our great railway stations"" to address ""crowding, cut journey times and improve passenger experience"". A spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies said: ""Train companies are pressing for reform that aims to help limit future fare rises by reducing the costs of running the railways, while making sure that we can keep on improving services for passengers. ""The reform agenda is about bringing the different parts of the railway closer together to provide a better deal for passengers and taxpayers.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Microsoft moves to disable Zeus botnet,"The company is working in collaboration with financial services to disable botnets powered by Zeus malware. Microsoft described the action as its ""most complex effort to disrupt botnets to date"". However, security company Sophos Labs said it had not seen any ""significant disruption"" to the illegal network. Senior attorney for Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit Richard Boscovich gavedetails of the operation in a blog post. ""Cybercriminals have built hundreds of botnets using variants of Zeus malware,"" he wrote. ""For this action - codenamed Operation b71 - we focused on botnets using Zeus, SpyEye and Ice-IX variants of the Zeus family of malware, known to cause the most public harm and which experts believe are responsible for nearly half a billion dollars in damages."" Freely available He added that due to the ""unique complexity"" of the targets, the company's goal was not to take down the botnet completely - but instead to implement ""strategic disruption"". However, security blogger Graham Cluley wrote that he was yet to see any sign of action being taken against the illegal networks. ""Sophos Labs hasn't seen any evidence of significant disruption to Zeus's activities through Microsoft's action,""he wrote. ""Because Zeus and SpyEye are sold as kits any takedown against specific botnets will not affect all the other botnets which are still out there. ""Since the kits are still available (freely in source form in the case of Zeus) it is highly likely that we will continue to see botnets created using them."" Zeus malware - and other variants of it - makes use of keylogging, a technique in which hidden software logs words and numbers typed into a person's keyboard. This can then be used to discover bank account details and other critical private information. Crimeware kit More worrying, Mr Boscovich wrote, was that the Zeus system is sold to criminals as a crimeware kit - typically selling for between $700 (£440) and $1,500 (£941) - allowing extra botnets to be created, increasing the threat. He said that Microsoft estimates that more than 13 million computers have been infected with Zeus malware worldwide. In court filings, Microsoft detailed 40 online aliases of people they suspect of being responsible for writing the malicious code. Botnets like Zeus are created by the spread of malicious software, often via infected emails or web browser vulnerabilities. Each ""bot"", as they are known, is a hijacked computer which can be used by hackers for any number of illegal activities. Users can protect themselves from such threats by regularly updating security software, and being wary of email attachments from senders they do not know or trust.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Scottish marine policy 'not fit for purpose', say MSPs","Holyrood's environment committee said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the national marine plan - which has taken five years to formulate. It aims to balance the oil and gas and renewable energy industries with the need to protect the environment. Ministers said they would respond to the concerns ""in due course"". The draft marine plan, published at the end of 2014, covers Scotland's sea areas out to 200 nautical miles and aims to protect and boost areas such as the energy industry, tourism and transport, while meeting the needs of the environment. 'Vague aspiration' But the cross-party environment committee's convener, SNP MSP Rob Gibson, said it was lacking in clarity. ""The committee is deeply disappointed that a government plan five years in the making is simply not yet fit for purpose,"" he said. ""Multiple uses are made of our marine environment, and increasingly these are coming into conflict, but the Scottish government's draft national marine plan does not provide a clear and concise set of policies that can be consistently applied by decision-makers and those using the marine environment. ""There is a danger the plan in its present form will create conflict by having highly prescriptive actions in some areas, while setting out vague aspirations in others. ""Simply put, instead of making the marine environment easier, it risks making it more difficult."" 'Widespread support' Calum Duncan, convenor of Scottish Environment Link's marine taskforce, said: ""Scotland's environment community have followed the development of the National Marine Plan closely. ""It is a chance not just to ensure developments at sea are well co-ordinated and sustainable, but also to enhance the diminished health of our seas, which is the legal duty of Scottish ministers. ""A good place to start is putting in place proper fisheries management in our marine protected areas (MPAs), but current plans allow scallop dredging and bottom trawling to continue across large areas of some MPAs.""

Postal workers 'need new law to stop dog attacks',"The report, commissioned by Royal Mail, recommends a change in law to help deal with the owners of dogs who attack. The report points out that currently action cannot be taken if an attack takes place on private property. The number of attacks ranges from Royal Mail's figure of 3,000 a year to the 5,000 suggested by the workers' union. The Communication Workers Union welcomed the report, saying it backed moves to get serious on punishment. Paul Coleman, a former postman who was attacked in Sheffield by two Staffordshire bull terriers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It has left me with really bad scarring and 27% disabled for life."" Iron bar He said: ""It was outside someone's house. They came with a garden rake and hit the dogs with that. They gave me a hammer and I hit the dogs in the head until the shaft of the hammer snapped...a man came from an engineering firm with a solid steel six-foot iron bar, hit it three times on the back and the dogs never let go."" Mr Coleman said he was off work for six months and has seen a clinical psychologist on and off ever since the attack in 2007. In his report, former High Court judge Sir Gordon Langley says current laws limited the legal protection available to postmen and women. He calls on the government to change the law so that action can be taken against dog owners wherever an attack takes place. Sir Gordon said: ""It is a matter of real concern to learn of the extent and frequency of attacks on postal workers and to find that for a considerable time there has been almost general agreement, not only on the inadequacies of the present law in England and Wales, but also on the nature of the reforms required to address it, but to date it remains unchanged."" Royal Mail said it would act immediately to change its policy towards owners of dogs who attack, to make it more ""robust"". It will look at suspending deliveries to addresses where attacks take place. Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon said: ""Dog attacks cause injuries and terrible trauma to our staff. Nobody should have to endure this and our staff are at an increased risk of such attacks simply because of the job they do."" New laws have already been introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with legislation planned in Wales. The Communication Workers Union, which has criticised the government on the issue in the past, said the report should be a step towards taking action. CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said: ""Sir Gordon's recommendations take on board our own long-standing campaign objectives of securing new UK-wide laws which apply on private property, moving away from breed-specific legislation, introducing micro-chipping and getting serious when it comes to prosecution and punishment.

Monmouth school's warning to parents in uniform row,"Monmouth Comprehensive is phasing in the uniform from September and told parents they must purchase it from a preferred supplier. Some parents are angry at having to buy £20 trousers and £16 skirts from Trutex, rather than from cheaper shops. The school's stance is contrary to Welsh Government uniform advice. Monmouthshire council said the school consulted with the ""whole school community over a lengthy period"" as per government guidelines. Deputy head Andy Williams sent a letter to parents which said ""sending students home (in line with Welsh Government guidance) is, of course, our last resort"". The community Facebook page has received hundreds of comment from concerned parents. Paula Beddis Simpson wrote: ""I am a single parent doing 2/3 jobs to make ends meet, it's totally unfair.

Alex Watkins added: ""It's not as if people are refusing to adhere to the uniform, just would like to choose where to buy trousers skirts and shirts. It's hardly unreasonable.""' Year seven and sixth form pupils will be expected to wear a branded blazer and tie instead of the existing polo shirt and jumper, which the school says had become ""tired, inconsistent and not fit for purpose"". 'Some concern' Pupils in other years can change to the new uniform from September if they choose to or if their old uniform is in need of replacement Parents claim the new uniform will cost more than £100 if they are forced to buy from the supplier. The school said it would cost £97 for boys and £93 for girls. The Welsh Government says governing bodies should consider stipulating ""basic items and colours but not styles so that items can be bought from retail chains at reasonable prices and not just from one supplier"". The school, which will move to a new £33m building in 2018, has acknowledged ""there has been some concern over the cost of trousers and skirts from our suppliers"". My Williams wrote: ""We trialled the use of barcodes for parents to buy cheaper (but often less ethically sourced) items from high street retailers.

Junaid Hafeez: Academic sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan,"Junaid Hafeez, 33, was arrested in March 2013 and accused of posting derogatory comments about the Prophet Muhammad on social media. Allegations of blasphemy are taken very seriously in Pakistan, and even an accusation is often enough to make someone a target for hardliners. Mr Hafeez's first lawyer, Rashid Rehman, was shot dead in 2014 after agreeing to take on the case. The lecturer has also spent years in solitary confinement, after repeated attacks by other prisoners. The sentence was delivered by a court in the Central Jail in Multan, where Mr Hafeez was being held. Mr Hafeez had studied a Master's degree in the US on a Fulbright Scholarship, specialising in American literature, photography and theatre. After returning to Pakistan he took up a lecturer position at Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) in Multan, where he worked until his arrest. Mr Hafeez's current counsel said the verdict was ""most unfortunate"", and told AFP news agency that they would appeal against the decision. Prosecution lawyers, meanwhile, distributed sweets to their colleagues, who chanted ""Allahu akbar"" and ""death to blasphemers"". Amnesty International said the verdict was ""a gross miscarriage of justice"" and described it as ""extremely disappointing and surprising"". What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws? Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry strict sentences, including death, for anyone who insults Islam. The offences relating to religion were first codified by India's British rulers in 1860, and were expanded in 1927. Pakistan inherited these laws when it came into existence after the partition of India in 1947. These early laws made it a crime to disturb a religious assembly, trespass on burial grounds, insult religious beliefs or to intentionally destroy or defile a place or an object of worship. Under these laws, the maximum punishment ranged from one to 10 years in jail. But between 1980 and 1986, a number of clauses were added by the military government of General Zia-ul Haq. Gen Haq wanted to ""Islamicise"" them and also legally to separate the Ahmadi community, declared non-Muslim in 1973, from the main body of Pakistan's overwhelmingly Muslim population. The new clauses made it illegal to make derogatory remarks against Islamic personages, introduced life sentences for ""wilful"" desecration of the Koran, and later, introduced the death penalty or life imprisonment for blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad. About 40 people are currently on death row for blasphemy - although so far, no executions for blasphemy have been carried out. The blasphemy laws have been under the spotlight internationally after Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian who spent eight years on death row, was freed from prison last year, following a Supreme Court decision which overturned her conviction. Her release sparked riots, and she had to seek safety in another country.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Joining first Welsh Youth Parliament 'incredible',"The parliament is made up of 60 young people, 40 of whom were elected in an online ballot, with a further 20 from organisations and charities. The first meeting will take place in February and the winning candidates will each serve a two-year term. Cardiff West winner Manon Clarke said it was ""incredible"" to have a chance to ensure young people's voices would be heard ""for the first time"". Manon, from Ysgol Gyfun Plasmawr, said joining the new parliament ""means so much to me"", and she had ""put in a lot of work promoting myself on social media platforms"" to get there. ""I think the voice of someone aged 11 to 18 is just as important as any other,"" she told BBC Wales Today. ""I think often young people's voices go unheard, and for the first time ever we have the chance, so it's incredible."" All 11 to 18-year-olds in Wales were eligible to vote, with about 13,000 registering to choose from a group of 480 candidates. Partner organisations include Girlguiding Cymru, Youth Cymru, Tros Gynnal Plant, Voices from Care, Barnardo's Cymru and Learning Disability Wales, with the aim of ensuring diversity and inclusivity for the new body. Greta Evans, said it was ""an honour"" to be representing Welsh language youth body the Urdd in the parliament, and she wanted to promote Welsh in schools and ""as a national language"". She also wanted to address mental health issues, she said. ""I see it in my friends, I see it in my year group, it's everywhere and it's something we definitely need to tackle,"" Greta said. ""And the third thing is the environment. There are lots of issues with plastic and pollution, especially in Cardiff, so those are the issues we're definitely going to be tackling."" Evan Burgess, from Aberconwy said it was a chance to tackle issues children face by bringing those issues to a national level. Speaking before the results were announced, at the beginning of Senedd proceedings, he said: ""There are issues you will face as a child no matter where you are in Wales and to bring those issues and problems up to a national level is going to be a really good way to tackle those problems."" During the campaign Evan said his top priorities were growing the Welsh economy, increasing sustainable tourism and improving transport. Presiding Officer Elin Jones said it was ""more than appropriate"" that young people had the chance to discuss their futures and ""inform"" the opinions of AMs. She said: ""The Senedd itself will listen to the voice of young people and there will be a mutual respect. ""There will be debate between the young people and the National Assembly itself, so that they do ultimately influence policies and decisions that will be taken that will affect their lives more so than any of ours."" She added the parliament will not just be a ""talking shop"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Pigs can play video games with their snouts, scientists find","Four pigs - Hamlet, Omelette, Ebony and Ivory - were trained to use an arcade-style joystick to steer an on-screen cursor into walls. Researchers said the fact that the pigs understood the connection between the stick and the game ""is no small feat"". And the pigs even continued playing when the food reward dispenser broke - apparently for the social contact. Usually, the pigs would be given a food pellet for ""winning"" the game level. But during testing, it broke - and they kept clearing the game levels when encouraged by some of the researchers' kind words. ""This sort of study is important because, as with any sentient beings, how we interact with pigs and what we do to them impacts and matters to them,"" lead author Dr Candace Croney said. The research team also thought that the fact the pigs could play video games at all - since they are far-sighted animals with no hands or thumbs - was ""remarkable"". But it was not easy for them. Out of the two Yorkshire pigs, Hamlet, was better at the game than Omelette, but both struggled when it got harder - hitting the single target just under half the time. The Panepinto micro pigs had a bigger gamer skill gap - while Ivory was able to hit one-wall targets 76% of the time, Ebony could only do it 34% of the time. But the researchers were still satisfied that the attempts were deliberate and focused, rather than random - what they called ""above chance"". That means that ""to some extent, all acquired the association between the joystick and cursor movement"". Kate Daniels, from Willow Farm in Worcestershire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while the scientists might have been impressed, ""I don't think this will come as a surprise to anyone that works with pigs"". She added: ""They're not playing Minecraft - but that they can manipulate a situation to get a reward is no surprise at all."" She paraphrased a quote often attributed to Winston Churchill: ""Dogs look up to you, cats look down on you, and pigs look you right in the eye."" She added: ""When you look a pig right in the eye, you can tell there's intelligence there."" Still, pigs are no match for humans when playing games - or even less intelligent primates. The same kind of experiment has been tried with chimpanzees and monkeys, who have the advantage of opposable thumbs, and were able to meet much higher requirements from researchers. The research paper was published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Miss America leaked emails: CEO Sam Haskell and three others quit,"The organisation said it would accept Mr Haskell's immediate resignation. Its chairperson, Lynn Weidner and two other executives are also leaving. The emails reportedly include vulgar references to past winners and comments about their sex lives. Former contestants criticised the ""appalling"" revelations. The organisation's president and chief operating officer, Josh Randle, has also resigned ""in light of recent and new developments"", a spokesperson confirmed to the BBC. Announcing the resignation of Mr Haskell in a statement posted on its Twitter account, the Miss America Organisation (MAO) said Ms Weidner would help install a new leadership before leaving. Board member Tammy Haddad resigned on Friday. The announcement of Mr Haskell's resignation came only hours after the MAO put out a statement saying he had been suspended. The Huffington Post published the alleged contents of three years of emails between Mr Haskell and other pageant officials. The internal emails include name-calling, slut-shaming and fat-shaming of some of the contestants who had taken part in the pageant. The revelations caused Dick Clark Productions, MAO's television sponsor, to cut ties with the long-standing pageant. Dick Clark Productions said in a statement on Friday they had been made aware of the emails ""several months ago"" and were ""appalled by their unacceptable content"". Pressure for the resignation of Mr Haskell also came from 49 former Miss Americas in an open letter. A former Miss America winner, Mallory Hagan, who was mocked in some of the emails said she ""wasn't shocked, but [felt] validated by the emails"". ""For the longest time, I've tried to explain to people around me that this is happening or these things are being said,"" the winner of the 2013 pageant told NBC. Gretchen Carlson, a former Miss America and a television presenter, said the alleged emails contained ""disgusting statements about women"" and ""vulgar slurs"". In a statement, Mr Haskell said he had been ""under stress from a full year of attacks by two Miss Americas, and while I don't ever want to offer an excuse, I do want to offer context"". But he also said the original story was ""vicious"" with ""conveniently edited emails"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Malaysia seeks 10 year-jail terms for 'fake news',"Under the Anti-Fake News Bill, those convicted of disseminating false content would be jailed or fined up to RM500,000 ($128,000; £90,400), or both. The bill was tabled in parliament on Monday, ahead of a national election that is expected within weeks. Critics have called the bill an attempt by the authorities to stifle dissent. According to the bill, the term ""fake news"" is defined as ""news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false"". An offender would be anyone who ""by any means, knowingly creates, offers, publishes, prints, distributes, circulates or disseminates any fake news or publication containing fake news"". Blogs, public forums and social media accounts are also covered by the bill. It applies to anyone inside or outside Malaysia, as long as the ""fake news"" published concerns the country or those in it, which means foreigners can technically be sentenced in absentia. True or false? The move has been described as an attempt to silence opposition ahead of the general election. It must be held by August, but is widely expected within the next few weeks. ""The bill is 100% intended to muffle dissent... the punishment is extremely high and what amounts to fake news has been loosely defined,"" Eric Paulsen, co-founder of Malaysian human rights group Lawyers for Liberty, told the BBC. ""It also looks like they are rushing through the bill... before the elections. It's likely that it will be passed."" He added that the bill could affect reporting stories such as the scandal surrounding 1MDB, Malaysia's state development fund. It is alleged that hundreds of millions of dollars were ""misappropriated"" from the fund. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) had in 2015 reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's personal bank accounts. Mr Najib has denied taking any money from 1MDB. Just days ago, a Malaysian minister said any news relating to 1MDB that was not confirmed by the government was false. ""If this is [the government's] benchmark, then we will have a situation where only the government can determine if things are true or false,"" said Mr Paulsen.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stormont crisis: Simon Hamilton says no new money for welfare deal,"Talks aimed at resolving the stalemate over welfare reform legislation are expected to resume at Stormont later. Sinn Féin withdrew its support for the bill last week. The DUP's Mr Hamilton said any resolution would be on the basis of the £90m per year previously set aside for welfare reform mitigation measures. ""Whilst we are keen to find that resolution there will no more money spent above and beyond what we have agreed,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster. ""Because to spend more money above and beyond what we have agreed to find a solution to this problem means that we would have to hit health, we would have to hit education, we would have to bit other key public services. ""So yes we will work away at finding a solution and I hope that we can find a resolution and I'm hopeful that we can make progress this week, but it is on the basis that there is no more money above and beyond what we have agreed at Stormont Castle."" Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said he was optimistic agreement could be reached. ""The mood remains hopeful and certainly our intention is to try to get this resolved this week,"" he said. ""There's quite a lot of complex details across a whole range of schemes that need to be worked out to ensure that there is protection for vulnerable people in society. ""That work is ongoing."" 'Best interests' The Northern Ireland parties have held several days of meetings to resolve the impasse, but no agreement has been reached yet. Both Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and the First Minister Peter Robinson have confirmed they will not travel to Washington for St Patrick's Day, in order to continue with negotiations. Mr Robinson tweeted on Sunday: ""White House agree priority is to maintain momentum in finding a resolution to welfare issue. Best to be in Northern Ireland dealing with it."" In a statement, Mr McGuinness said: ""Progress has been made in talks between the parties but there is still a lot of work to be done. ""I have decided therefore in the best interests of trying to move the situation forward that I will not be travelling to the US to take part in events marking St Patrick's Day."" The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform in the Stormont House Agreement in December. The issue had previously threatened the future of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive. Last week, Sinn Féin withdrew support for the bill and accused the DUP of going back on what had been agreed. The DUP rejected this, saying there had never been the money for all the things Sinn Féin wanted and that Sinn Féin had been aware of this.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pakistan asks Facebook to help fight blasphemy,"Facebook has agreed to send a team to Pakistan to address reservations about content on the social media site, according to the interior ministry. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and incendiary issue in Pakistan. Critics say blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities. Earlier this week Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif voiced his support for a wide-ranging crackdown on blasphemous content on social media. In a statement on his party's official Twitter account, he described blasphemy as an ""unpardonable offence"". 'Should share information' Then on Thursday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar reasserted Pakistan's determination to tackle the issue, saying he would take ""any steps necessary"" to make sure Pakistan's message got across. He said he had asked officials to liaise with the FBI in the US and with social media platforms on a daily basis. ""Facebook and other service providers should share all information about the people behind this blasphemous content with us,"" he is quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper. There has been little official description of what blasphemous content has been found online so far, but in the past blasphemy accusations have ranged from depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to critiques and inappropriate references to the Koran. But some critics say that this latest move is simply a way of cracking down on dissent. When five liberal bloggers and activists recently went missing, they were accused of blasphemy on social media. It is a very serious allegation in the deeply conservative nation, which can make those accused of it a target of public anger. Analysis - Tahir Imran, BBC Urdu social media editor In Pakistan there is a growing popular resentment to this so-called ""blasphemous content"" on social media, especially on Facebook. People are often openly accused of ""committing blasphemy on social media"". One top security agency has openly urged the masses to report anyone who is involved in posting such material online. Digital rights groups have expressed ""serious reservations"" and have called such steps ""playing with the lives of innocent people"". They have also criticised Facebook ""for colluding with authorities and censoring content infringing freedom of expression"". In a statement quoted by the AP news agency, Facebook said it viewed government requests with care keeping in mind ""the goal of protecting the privacy and rights of our users. ""We disclose information about accounts solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other formal request may be required for international requests, and we include these in our Government Requests Report.'' But Facebook has not yet made any public comment about a delegation being sent to Pakistan. Pakistan has often blocked access to pornographic sites and sites with anti-Islamic content and in 2010 a Pakistani court blocked Facebook over caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Somali famine: Care aid driver abducted in Kenyan camp,"Care Kenya said three men approached the car on Monday, ordered him into the back and drove off. The abduction occurred near Dadaab - the world's biggest refugee camp. Care has scaled down its aid effort following the first known attack on an aid worker since famine was declared in parts of Somalia in July. The UN says more than 1,000 people are turning up at Dadaab every day fleeing Somalia's famine and war. Tens of thousands of people have died in what the UN says is East Africa's worst drought for 60 years. Twenty years of fighting and the lack of a national government mean that Somalia is by far the worst-affected country in the region. Screening centre According to Care's country director, Gary McGurk, the abduction took place in broad daylight. It is not clear what nationality the attackers were or where they took the car and driver. ""We have suspended our programmes [in Dadaab] except for the life-saving programmes,"" Mr McGurk told the BBC. Care says it is still distributing water and food but has halted its education and counselling programmes. The BBC's East Africa correspondent Will Ross says Hagadera, where the attack took place, is one of the three sections making up Dadaab, which is now known as Kenya's third largest city and houses almost 450,000 refugees. Insecurity is a great problem and reports of rape are common, he says. Earlier this month, a British man was killed and his wife abducted further south along the Kenya-Somalia border. It is now believed she is being held by a pirate gang. The UN says it is paying for more Kenyan police posts to be set up and hopes security will improve when a new screening centre opens on the Somali border. Six areas of Somalia have been declared famine zones - mostly in southern parts controlled by the Islamist group al-Shabab. The al-Qaeda-linked group banned many aid agencies from its territory two years ago. This has prompted tens of thousands of people to seek food aid in the capital, Mogadishu, which is ruled by the weak interim government, or in camps in neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kim Jong-nam killing: North Korea condemns Malaysia,"It does not name Kim Jong-nam, but the KCNA report appears to be state media's first reference to the death of the half-brother of North Korea's leader. Mr Kim died after being poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport and his body remains in a hospital mortuary. Several North Koreans are wanted in connection with his death. They include a senior official at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur as well as an employee of the state airline, Air Koryo. Four other North Koreans named earlier in the case are thought to have left Malaysia already, while another North Korean is in detention. Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said on Thursday that he had asked international police agency Interpol to issue an alert for the four. On Wednesday, Malaysian police confirmed that Mr Kim died after two women - also in detention - wiped a toxin on his face while he was waiting for a flight to Macau. It said the attack was ""planned"" and that the women had been well trained. They have not directly blamed the North Korean state, but said North Koreans were clearly behind it. Mr Kim was once seen as a possible successor to his father, Kim Jong-il, but was bypassed in favour of his younger half brother, Kim Jong-un, and spent many years living abroad. He had been travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol. Malaysia says it believes the man was indeed Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-un, though it is seeking family DNA samples for official confirmation, a request North Korea called ""absurd"". KCNA said only that ""a citizen of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]"" who was travelling on a diplomatic passport had died due to ""a heart stroke"". It said reports of a poisoning were false and Malaysia was part of an ""anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the South Korean authorities"". Conducting a post-mortem on the holder of a diplomatic passport without state permission was ""a wanton human rights abuse and an act contrary to human ethics and morality"", it said. ""The biggest responsibility for his death rests with the government of Malaysia,"" said the report, and the refusal to hand the body back to North Korean officials ""proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicise the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose"". Who are the suspects? Ten people have either been named as suspects or are wanted by Malaysian police for questioning in connection to Kim Jong-nam's killing.

Coronavirus: Salary subsidy scheme extended into June,"More than nine million workers are expected to be furloughed, or put on state-paid leave, under the government's job retention scheme . Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Friday the wage subsidy would be available for another month until the end of June. Business groups and firms such as Swissport earlier warned if the scheme was not extended, more jobs would go. The chancellor said the salary scheme would be extended again ""if necessary"". ""With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It is vital for people's livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery."" How the scheme works Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers' wages for March, April and May if they are put on leave. Employers will pay workers and reclaim the money from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) at the end of April. They can apply to join the scheme from Monday. Figures from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) suggest nearly a fifth of smaller firms and half of companies will access the help. 'Protecting jobs' The Confederation for British Industry (CBI) welcomed the salary subsidy extension after repeatedly warning that many firms could start to cut staff without one. ""This extension means that firms will no longer be forced to issue redundancy notices over the next few to days to comply with 45-day consultation requirements, and can instead return to focusing on protecting jobs and their businesses,"" said CBI boss Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. ""It's absolutely clear that these vital support systems must stay in place until it's safe for people to return to work and we can begin to restart and revive our economy."" Chief executive of the Airport Operators Association Karen Dee said: ""Airports are making significant use of the job retention scheme, which has helped to address some of the challenges they are currently facing, so it is good news that the Chancellor has decided to extend it"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US seizes millions of dollars of Iranian fuel bound for Venezuela,"About 1.1 million barrels of fuel were confiscated ""with the assistance of foreign partners"", according to the Justice Department. Washington said the shipments violated US sanctions. Iran's ambassador to Venezuela claimed that neither the ships nor their owners were Iranian. A judge issued a warrant for the seizure of the oil cargo from the four tankers after the US filed a lawsuit last month. In a statement on Friday, the US Justice Department said it had ""successfully executed the seizure"" of ""a multimillion dollar fuel shipment by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)"". The IRGC is a branch of the Iranian armed forces that the US has designated a foreign terrorist organisation. ""This seized property is now in US custody,"" the statement said, without specifying when or where the seizures took place. The US Justice Department said that following the seizure, Iran's navy made an unsuccessful bid to board an ""unrelated ship"" in an ""apparent attempt to recover the seized petroleum"". A senior US official told the Associated Press news agency that no military force was used in the seizures and that the vessels themselves were not confiscated. Instead, the official said, the US threatened the ships' owners, insurers and captains with sanctions to force them to hand over the oil. It is not currently clear where the vessels — the Bella, Bering, Pandi and Luna — are. Iranian Ambassador to Venezuela Hojat Soltani described reports of the seizures as ""false propaganda"". ""This is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the US propaganda machine,"" he wrote on Twitter. Tensions between Iran and the US have escalated since Washington's unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal. Washington has imposed heavy sanctions on both Iran and Venezuela to block oil exports. It wants to drive Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power and change the behaviour of Iran's leaders. The tensions between Iran and the US were blamed for attacks on oil two tankers near the Strait of Hormuz in June last year - although Tehran denied US accusations that it was behind the explosions. Later that month, Iran shot down a US drone in the area. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the US State Department said the proceeds from the seized fuel shipments ""could now support the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund instead of those engaging in terrorism"".

Energy-efficient show home opens at Ravenscraig site,"The concept three-bedroom family house incorporates recyclable materials and was built using a pod design which allowed partial off-site assembly. Planners and builders will be invited to visit and learn how environmental low-impact homes are affordable. The ""Resource Efficient House"" will be at the site for the next three years. The house, which cost about £200,000 to build, is the result of a collaboration between Zero Waste Scotland and Tigh Grian. 'Green credentials' Both bodies believe that if its construction principles were adopted across the building sector then modern three-bedroom family homes could be delivered at a lower cost than £200,000. Iain Gulland, director of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ""The Resource Efficient House offers home buyers, house builders and indeed Scotland an innovative new approach to low cost housing, combining an affordable build and living cost with impressive green credentials. ""But beyond this, what this model offers is a potential industry for Scotland, with jobs and economic benefits. ""We now have a showcase example where the industry can work out how to design their projects and see for themselves that sustainable doesn't mean unaffordable or inferior quality."" The show home was built on a pod design so that it could be part-assembled off site to reduce the effects of weather conditions on building times. The wall insulation used will be able to be recycled when the house is deconstructed in three years. Inside, the house uses a variety of recycled materials in the fixtures and fittings. The kitchen work surfaces are made from material reprocessed from recycled coffee cups. Recycled paint is used for the decoration and the kitchen bar stools are made from reclaimed wood from whisky barrels. The house also uses heating, lighting and water conservation measures to make it more energy efficient and affordable to live in. Jobs potential The building phase of the house generated less than five tonnes of construction waste, compared with a figure of up to 13 tonnes for an average new three-bedroom house. Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead, who opened the project on Thursday, said: ""If every house in Scotland was like this then we would cut the amount of construction waste being sent to landfill and help make Scotland a more resource-efficient nation. ""Future housing built using these methods offers the opportunity to benefit the economy as well as the environment, with the potential for new jobs, and new products. ""I hope that this house will inspire others to adopt these techniques and help the construction sector to grow but minimise its impact on waste."" The house is located at the BRE Innovation Park at Ravenscraig. Although it will be primarily for industry use, members of the public may be able to book tours through BRE.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Quarter of children in north Wales overweight or obese,"More than a quarter of four and five year olds in the region are in the category. Betsi Cadwaladr health board has drawn up a three-year plan, including helping pregnant women to manage their weight. But a health expert said being overweight was becoming a ""social norm"". Just over 28.6% of four and five year olds in the region are overweight, including 12% who are obese, according to a report to be considered by the board on Thursday. The report, ""Children's health and wellbeing: The impact across the life course"", said this was a problem which continued into adulthood in a ""vast majority"" of cases. It warned: ""Obesity in childhood leads to significant health issues across the life course, and some areas of north Wales have the highest prevalence of childhood obesity in the UK."" The report also found ""considerable gaps in north Wales in obesity services to support children and families"". Across Wales, the Child Measurement Programme, published in August 2016, found 26% of reception-aged children were classed as overweight or obese. Sioned Quirke, an obesity specialist and spokeswoman for British Dietetic Association Wales, said: ""Published figures every year are showing an increase [in overall obesity]. ""We are not even at the stage where they are levelling out. ""That's not surprising taking into account the type of patients we are seeing every day and the numbers being referred to us. The numbers are increasing every year."" She warned the amount people are overweight by is also ""getting worse"". ""It's something that's becoming quite apparent, it's becoming the social norm,"" Ms Quirke added. ""People will compare themselves to other people and if others are obese or bigger than them, we think we are ok. ""People constantly say 'I'm not that big' but they are comparing themselves to people who are bigger."" The health board's draft three-year plan includes improving breastfeeding rates, infant feeding in general and healthy weaning, as well as reducing obesity levels in mothers. It also focuses on promoting the new national guidance on childhood obesity which includes which includes ensuring children play outside every day, limiting screen time, daily fruit and vegetable intake and having enough sleep.

Thousands of low-paid Britons set for pay rise,"The number of companies has more than doubled in the last year, meaning 35,000 low-paid workers will see their pay rise when the wage is increased on Monday, Citizens UK said. The current Living Wage rate is £7.65 an hour, compared with the national minimum wage of £6.50. The Living Wage reflects what workers require to meet their basic needs. In London, the Living Wage is currently £8.80 an hour. The rate is set by the Living Wage Foundation, part of the community organisation Citizens UK, and is calculated by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. It has cross-party support. Last week, research published by the Resolution Foundation think tank found that a record five million UK workers were in low-paid jobs, having risen by 250,000 in the last 12 months. This was a problem for the government, it said, because it kept income tax revenues low. 'Costs taxpayer' ""The good news is that the number of accredited Living Wage employers has more than doubled this year - over 1,000 employers across the UK have signed up,"" said Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation. He added that the number of the companies signed up in the FTSE 100 had risen from four to 18, and included Canary Wharf Group and Standard Life. Nationwide and Nestle have also signed up. ""Low pay costs the taxpayer money - firms that pay the minimum wage are seeing their workers' pay topped up through the benefits system,"" he said. The new higher rate of Living Wage will be announced at 00:01 GMT on Monday, while the rate for London will be announced by Mayor Boris Johnson later in the morning. Both will rise to reflect the higher costs of living. A report by consultants KPMG revealing the number of workers being paid less than the Living Wage will also be released on Monday. ""Far too many employers are stuck in the spiral of low pay,"" said KPMG's Head of Living Wage Mike Kelly. ""Unless wages rise, a significant sector of the UK population will see themselves caught between the desire to contribute to society and the inability to afford to do so. ""The Living Wage may not be possible for every business, but is certainly not impossible to explore the feasibility of paying it."" Over the wider economy as a whole, wages are not rising as fast as prices, meaning real pay for many people is falling. The latest figures show that average weekly earnings are rising by 0.9% excluding bonuses, below the rate of inflation, which is 1.2%.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Compulsory mental health detentions in Scotland at record high,"Data from the Mental Welfare Commission revealed there were 6,038 such detentions under the Mental Health Act. Rates of emergency orders used in a crisis have risen most sharply among teenagers over the last decade. The figures also revealed big differences in the rates of detention between different health board areas. The commission said the rise in the number of young people requiring emergency treatment was a particular concern and needed further investigation. The figures revealed: Mental Welfare Commission executive director Dr Moira Connolly said: ""The rise in numbers of times detention is used in relation to young people is concerning. ""We already know of the increased number of children and young people seeking help for mental health issues, but we need to understand more about whether those pressures are now being reflected in our data regarding compulsory hospital treatment."" The total number of detentions was the highest since the Mental Health Act came into force in Scotland in 2003 and revealed big regional variations. Emergency detentions are supposed to take place with the consent of a specialist social worker, called a mental health officer, but again this varies between areas. In Dumfries and Galloway there was 83% compliance but in Greater Glasgow and Clyde this fell to 33%, the commission said. ""The consent of a mental health officer in these cases is an important safeguard for the individual,"" said Dr Connolly. ""The low rates in some areas are a real concern for us and we hope that our data will be taken into account by the government and by health boards, local authorities and integrated joint boards, with whom we will continue to raise it."" Independent review The Scottish government said an independent review was examining the increase in compulsory detention and regional variation across Scotland and an interim report would be published next May. A spokesperson said: ""Prevention and early intervention are key focus areas and we will put in place 350 additional school councillors and 250 school nurses by 2022 to support young people. ""We have also expanded the Distress Brief Intervention programme pilots this year to include 18-year-olds. ""Any increase in compulsory treatment may represent the effects of more people coming forward for treatment and an increased awareness in mental ill health more generally. ""It's also important to note that the majority of people subject to compulsory treatment are on short-term orders rather than long-term.""

But the CMA said: ""The companies are two of the largest grocery retailers in the UK and their stores overlap in hundreds of local areas, where shoppers could face higher prices or worse quality of service."" The competition body said it would also look at issues relating to fuel, general merchandise such as clothing and what it describes as ""increased buyer power over suppliers"". It has been calculated that the deal, announced in April, between the UK's second and third-largest supermarkets would create the UK's biggest retail chain with a 31.4% market share and with 2,800 stores. Analysis by retail property experts Maximise UK has estimated that the CMA will recommend that 6%, or 73, of the combined group's supermarkets should be sold off. Others have speculated that up to 300 sites could have to be divested. Suppliers have also said they could suffer as a result of the merger, which comes at time when supermarkets are facing pressure from discounters. The CMA investigation was announced as rival Tesco, the biggest supermarket, prepared to unveil its new Jack's discount chain. Asda and Sainsbury's had asked the CMA to ""fast track"" the first stage of its inquiry, which began in August. The CMA said it had now moved to the second stage and would publish a detailed issues statement in the coming weeks. This will set out the key topics it will scrutinise by taking evidence from consumer surveys and information from retailers, suppliers and industry bodies. It has set a deadline of 5 March 2019 to complete this stage of its investigation. When Asda chief executive Roger Burnley and Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe gave evidence to MPs about the deal, they insisted they would have a 25% market share, rather than the 30% predicted by analysts. They said that small suppliers would not be hurt by their attempt to cut the price of every day items such as milk, bread and tinned tomatoes by 10%. US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will retain 42% of the combined business.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Health budget rise 'less than was promised',"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The government made big play of the extra £8.4bn on top of inflation it was giving the NHS this parliament when it unveiled its spending plans last year. But the Health Select Committee said the true figure was about £4.5bn. The MPs said a different definition of spending was used to give the idea of more funding. Ministers have rejected the accusation. The cross-party group of MPs said instead of focusing on the whole health budget ministers highlighted the amount going to the frontline via NHS England. In 2015-16 that was about £101bn, but that ignored £15bn of money set aside for other aspects such as training and public health. This is being cut once inflation is taken into account and means the total health budget rises from £116bn in 2015-16 to just over £120bn by the end of the parliament. MPs said this was important because the cuts to other areas of spending would have an impact on everything from staffing to health promotion schemes, such as obesity programmes, which have a direct impact on the frontline of the NHS. The committee also said the scale of overspending last year - NHS trusts finished 2015-16 £2.45bn in the red - would mean large chunks of the extra money being used to cover deficits. Committee chair Dr Sara Wollaston added: ""Whilst the NHS has been treated favourably compared to many other departments, the increase in health funding is less than was promised if assessed by usual definitions."" 'Flawed' policy But a Department of Health spokesman said ministers stood by their figures, saying despite public finances being tight the government had found the money needed. ""We reject these conclusions,"" he said. Meanwhile, leading researchers have questioned the government's policy of creating a seven-day NHS at a time when money is so tight. Rachel Meacock, from the University of Manchester, called for a pause in the policy, saying the arguments made by the government that increasing staffing at weekends would cut death rates were ""flawed"". She said pushing ahead with the policy could end up making care during the week worse because services would be stretched. Prof Julian Bion, who leads an official research programme into NHS care at weekends, said the plans would be ""unachievable"" with the current level of funding. He predicted it could even be a ""good 20 years"" before the policy was fully realised across both emergency and non-emergency care.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Julia Donaldson: Children's authors 'don't get recognition',"By Huw ThomasBBC Wales arts and media correspondent Speaking at the Hay Festival, she said new books risked going out of print unless the creator had star appeal. Donaldson has written 200 books, including fiction for young adults and picture books. But, she said her contemporaries were ""certainly not getting the press coverage they deserve"". She added: ""There are some great authors and illustrators out there, but because of the way that there are so few bookshops now, and not so many libraries, and that big online companies have taken over, it's a bit much. ""Everything has to be the next big thing or else just go out of print."" Children's books account for a large proportion of total sales and celebrity authors such as David Walliams have helped keep the market buoyant. But Donaldson said children's books were seldom reviewed in newspapers - leading to a lack of recognition for many - something she would ""really like to be remedied"". ""In some ways it's a golden age but, unfortunately, lots of authors and illustrators are not getting the recognition they deserve."" The Hay Festival has staged events to mark anniversaries for some of the UK's best-loved children's books - including The Gruffalo, Elmer the Elephant and We're Going on a Bear Hunt. Such titles have remained staples for bedtime stories, but other authors are hoping to encroach on a market dominated by modern classics and celebrity authors. Writer Wendy White, from Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, won the Tir Na n'Og Award, in 2014 for her book Welsh Cakes and Custard. White is part of the festival's Writers at Work programme, which gives Welsh authors opportunities to receive tuition from some of the star writers appearing at Hay. She said a children's book focused on Wales may never reach a best-seller list, but wanted her work to reflect real Welsh lives. ""I think it is really important that children see themselves and their lives reflected in the books that they read,"" she said. ""If they take part in the school eisteddfod, or they have a mamgu [Welsh grandmother], that's not going to be reflected anywhere else."" White has three children's books published and has written adult fiction under the pseudonym Sara Gethin. Despite her success, she does not expect her children's books to have high sales figures because of their Welsh subject matter. ""It would be lovely to have a best-seller, especially a best-seller that reflected Wales,"" she said. ""But, really, I just enjoy writing for children in Wales. I see that they enjoy the books that reflect them, and their lives. ""Whether I sell a hundred copies, 1,000 copies, or more, it doesn't really matter. ""It is just good to know that my books are out there, and that I intend to carry on writing with a focus on Wales.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Manston Airport to host lorry park trial,"More than 100 HGVs will travel the 20-mile route from Manston Airport, near Ramsgate, to the Port of Dover. Hauliers fear that a no-deal Brexit will create additional border checks, leading to queues of up to 29 miles. The government said it had to ""prepare for all eventualities... including a possible no deal"". Theresa May is attempting to persuade MPs to support her draft deal, but has faced opposition, including from the DUP, which props up the Conservative government. Duncan Buchanan, of the Road Haulage Association (RHA), which helped to organise the trial, told the BBC: ""These sort of practical, pragmatic tests need to be done - it just shouldn't be done as late as this. ""It should have taken place nine months ago."" It is part of Operation Brock, which is intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20 and prevent a repeat of road closures experienced in 2015 under Operation Stack. The trial, which will take place between 08:00 and 11:00 GMT on the day many return to work for the first time after Christmas, will test how the A256 copes with increased lorry traffic. It has been organised with the help of the RHA and the Freight Transport Association. Mr Buchanan said import and export businesses on both sides of Channel had ""no idea how they are going to deal with the customs process"" under a no-deal Brexit. He said any additional customs checks would lead to queues, adding: ""The more rigorous the customs, the longer the queues are likely to be."" He said the Department for Transport (DfT) had hoped to keep the trial ""pretty confidential"", but details were leaked to local press. A DfT spokesman said: ""We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU. However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal. ""We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that, if it needs to be implemented, the system is fully functional."" Kent County Council said: ""We are working with the Department for Transport to ensure there is an effective plan in place should there be any disruption once the UK has left the EU."" It said Operation Brock ""would have taken place regardless of the result of the referendum, to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption, including bad weather and industrial action"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China bubonic plague: WHO 'monitoring' case but says it is 'not high risk',"A herdsman is stable in hospital after being confirmed with the disease at the weekend. A WHO spokeswoman said the case was being ""well managed"". The bubonic plague was once the world's most feared disease, but can now be easily treated. What has the WHO said? Spokeswoman Margaret Harris said: ""Bubonic plague has been with us and is always with us, for centuries. We are looking at the case numbers in China. It's being well managed. ""At the moment, we are not considering it high risk but we're watching it, monitoring it carefully."" The WHO said it was informed on Monday of the case of the herdsman, who is being treated at a hospital in Bayannur. Chinese news agency Xinhua says Mongolia had also confirmed two cases last week - brothers who had eaten marmot meat in Khovd province. Russian officials are warning communities in the country's Altai region not to hunt marmots, as infected meat from the rodents is a known transmission route. What is bubonic plague? Bubonic plague, caused by bacterial infection, was responsible for one of the deadliest epidemics in human history - the Black Death - which killed about 50 million people across Africa, Asia and Europe in the 14th Century. There have been a handful of large outbreaks since. It killed about a fifth of London's population during the Great Plague of 1665, while more than 12 million died in outbreaks during the 19th Century in China and India. But nowadays it can be treated by antibiotics. Left untreated, the disease - which is typically transmitted from animals to humans by fleas - has a 30-60% fatality rate. Symptoms of the plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin. Could there be another epidemic? Bubonic cases are rare, but there are still a few flare-ups of the disease from time to time. Madagascar saw more than 300 cases during an outbreak in 2017. However, a study in medical journal The Lancet found fewer than 30 people died. In May last year, two people in Mongolia died after eating the raw meat of a marmot. However, it's unlikely any cases will lead to an epidemic. ""Unlike in the 14th Century, we now have an understanding of how this disease is transmitted,"" Dr Shanti Kappagoda, an infectious diseases doctor at Stanford Health Care, told news site Heathline. ""We know how to prevent it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Michelin Tyres Plc fears over proposed energy cost rises,"By Clodagh RiceBusiness Reporter, BBC News NI Michelin Tyres Plc, based in Ballymena, County Antrim, is concerned about the financial impact the subsidies are having on its energy bills. A wider UK scheme is being ended early by the government but will continue in Northern Ireland. Michelin said its £9m energy bill has been increased by £75,000. Figures from the Department of Trade suggest this would add £30,000 on to the bills of the top 200 companies. Northern Ireland has the second highest energy prices in Europe. Tailwinds Michelin Tyres Plc employs 870 people in Northern Ireland. The firm said the government should assist Bombardier with its anaerobic energy systems projects. Site manager Gerard Cassidy said: ""I have a committed desire to see Northern Ireland manufacturing succeed. ""We need all the tailwinds we can muster, not additional costs."" North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said: ""[Stormont politicians] need to take time to consider the implications of any decision, to take evidence from the likes of Michelin, who employ almost 1,000 people."" ""If the wrong decisions are made in a rushed manner we will see the knock-on effects for the next 20 years and could in the process place the future of major employers such as Michelin and their fellow manufacturing heavyweights' continued presence in Northern Ireland in severe jeopardy."" Keeping the subsidies going longer in Northern Ireland than the rest of the UK could also cost households £16 extra in their bills. Jeopardy The subsidy has been the Northern Ireland Executive's main policy measure to support the development of renewable energy. Northern Ireland Renewable Industry Group (NIRIG) believes that withdrawing government support would have a ""catastrophic"" impact on both the industry and the NI economy. They predict that £470m of investment and 51 onshore wind projects could be put in jeopardy as a result. NIRIG chairman Patrick McClughan said onshore wind is one of the most cost-effective ways of producing electricity for Northern Ireland in the future. ""The aim is to become support-free within 25 years of the first wind farm becoming operational,"" he said. ""For investors and consumers in Northern Ireland to see the continuing success of onshore wind, helping to keep electricity bills lower, there needs to be a stable and supportive policy framework.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Melbourne attack: Man shot dead after fire and fatal stabbing,"Authorities now say they are treating the attack as terror-related. The attacker, 31, was shot after confronting officers on a busy city street, authorities said. He was taken into custody in a critical condition. The two survivors are in hospital, neither are in a serious condition. The suspect has not been named. Police said they were ""not looking for anyone further at this early stage"". ""We don't believe there is an ongoing threat at this stage, but certainly we are treating it as a terrorism incident,"" said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. He said the suspect, who is of Somali origin, was ""someone that is known"" to both local police and federal intelligence, adding it was ""mainly in respect to relatives"" who are ""certainly persons of interest to us"". The Islamic State (IS) group said on Friday that one of its ""fighters"" was behind the attack, its Amaq news agency reported. What happened in Melbourne? Officers were initially called to reports of a car fire near Bourke Street, a busy thoroughfare, at about 16:20 local time (05:20 GMT), just before the evening rush hour. Police later discovered that the vehicle was packed with ""barbecue-style"" gas cylinders. Footage circulating on social media shows the vehicle crashed into shop fronts, engulfed by flames. However, the cylinders did not explode, police said. ""As they got out of the car, they were confronted by a male brandishing a knife and threatening them,"" Supt David Clayton said at a news conference. ""At the same time, passers-by were calling out that members of the public had been stabbed."" Other footage shared on Twitter shows at least two police officers confronting the man, who is brandishing a large knife. At one point, what appears to be a member of the public tries to help, using a shopping trolley to push the assailant back. Who were the victims? None of the three men reportedly stabbed at the scene have been officially named. However Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said on Twitter that local businessman Rod Patterson was among those attacked. ""A nicer bloke you wouldn't meet,"" Mr Hodgman tweeted. ""It's not surprising he would step in to help others. We all wish him well."" According to Victoria Police, a 26-year-old and 58-year-old were both taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. A police officer was also treated at the scene Is this the first time Melbourne has been attacked? No. This incident comes as a man is on trial for a 2017 attack on the same street which left six people dead and dozens wounded. James Gargasoulas is accused of deliberately driving his car into pedestrians on Bourke Street, hitting 33 people. His defence barrister has said he was in a drug-induced psychosis at the time. Last year, Australian police also arrested a man they alleged was trying to carry out an attack in the city over New Year's Eve.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Anger at Manx mobile library cuts,"By Mark EdwardsBBC News The mobile library delivers books to the most remote island communities, including more than 70 people who cannot leave their homes. Nancy Payne, 97, is deaf and said the service is a lifeline. ""I don't watch the television and I can't listen to music, so without books I would have nothing."" The Isle of Man government needs to make savings of £35m in the next financial year. In February's Manx budget, the government announced that along with the family library in Douglas, the mobile service would close in September 2012. Sandra Henderson has been the head librarian for 12 years and said the end of the service would have a ""dramatic impact on people's lives"". ""This service brings joy into people's lives. We are always greeted with a smile when we arrive at the door. 'Fantastic stories' ""It is so satisfying to be able to provide people with books. We get to know about them and their lives. I've heard so many fantastic stories. ""It would be such a tragedy if it had to close."" The campaign to save the libraries has also received support from award-winning British author Alan Bennett and has seen more than 2,000 people sign a petition. Ms Payne continued: ""It was such a shock when I heard they were talking about closing. ""They are very good and they bring me books that they know I will like. So I am very lucky. The library is a lifeline to people like me. ""If they take my books away I don't know what I would do. I used to like sewing and knitting but I have arthritis now in my hands and it is too painful. ""There is nothing else I could do except read the paper and look at the birds,"" she said. Together with the family library in Douglas, the two services cost the government £237,000 a year to run but the government said that ""savings have to me made."" On Friday Chief Minister Allan Bell MHK announced the formation of a Council of Ministers working party to support the Department of Education and Children in progressing alternative options for maintaining the service. The Chief Minister said that a ""range of options are being actively pursued so that services can continue to be provided.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UUP leader Mike Nesbitt rules out electoral pact with DUP,"""I can't imagine any circumstances where it would be good for the Ulster Unionist Party, good for the pro-union people of Northern Ireland or good for politics to have an electoral pact,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Politics. The former broadcaster said he would take the UUP's sole ministerial seat on the Northern Ireland Executive at some point before the next assembly election. ""I think it would be good for the Ulster Unionist leader to be in the executive,"" he said. Mr Nesbitt, 54, defeated South Down assembly member John McCallister by 536 votes to 129 in the contest on Saturday at the UUP annual general meeting in Belfast. 'Cohesive' At the centre of the campaign was whether to back Mr Nesbitt's plan to remain part of the coalition Northern Ireland Executive and keep the party's one ministerial position, or to go into opposition as favoured by Mr McCallister. Mr Nesbitt said the party needed ""to be more cohesive as a unit and to be more coherent in the messages that we bring to the public"". ""The really big challenge is delivering the social justice agenda in the Belfast Agreement which hasn't been delivered,"" said the Strangford assembly member. ""It's about bringing about the shared, and not the 'shared-out' future, and that's where we will draw a line between ourselves and the Democratic Unionist Party."" Mr Nesbitt said it was important to connect with ordinary people who feel the work done by Stormont is not relevant to them. ""I grew up in leafy suburbs in north and east Belfast, but if I had been born a mile down the road closer to the city centre you might never heard of me,"" he said. ""What I'm thinking is we're not connected, and maybe what I need to do is go and find a family who will adopt me for 24 hours. ""I'd like to live in an area of social deprivation because I think it's important to get a feel of what it's like."" 'Yearn for unity' The DUP said Mr Nesbitt's rejection of a unionist pact was disappointing. ""The unionists that I meet throughout the country yearn for unity,"" the party's Simon Hamilton said. ""They want to see the DUP working with the UUP. They want the pro-union family working together. ""It disappointed, but didn't surprise, me that Mike's first policy announcements were that he wants to defeat the DUP and is against unionist unity."" Mr Nesbitt takes over from Tom Elliott, who announced last month he was standing down as leader after just 18 months in the job. Mr Nesbitt is a former presenter of UTV news, and presented its evening news programme for 10 years before leaving in 2006. He began his career as a sports presenter at the BBC, anchoring the flagship Good Morning Ulster radio programme for a number of years. He became a Victims' Commissioner in 2008.

Nawaz Sharif: Ex-PM leaves Pakistan for medical treatment,"Sharif, a three-time prime minister, has an immune system disorder and other health problems. The Lahore High Court lifted a travel ban on Saturday and the government rubber-stamped the decision on Monday. Imran Khan's government had been reluctant to release Sharif. It wanted the politician - who has so far served less than 12 months of a seven year prison sentence - to sign an indemnity bond worth $44m (£34m) before allowing him to go abroad. However, the court allowed him to travel without signing the bond. How ill is Nawaz Sharif? Sharif's health and the travel ban have dominated news in Pakistan for nearly a month. Last month, his blood platelet count dropped to a critical 16,000, compared to around 150,000 for a healthy person, a doctor told BBC Urdu's Umar Nangiana in Lahore. The 69-year-old is also on drugs for a cardiac problem, and suffers from diabetes and kidney issues. Both official and private medical boards have recommended he is treated abroad, as Pakistan does not have adequate facilities. Sharif will travel via Doha in a ""high-end air ambulance"" with a fully-staffed intensive care unit and operating theatre, his personal doctor said. Why is he serving a jail sentence? Sharif was prime minister from 1990 to 1993, then again from 1997 to 1999, and finally from 2013 to 2017. He is also one of the country's richest industrialists. In 2018 - following the Panama Papers leak - he was found guilty of corruption, relating to his family's ownership of upmarket London apartments. He was given a 10-year prison sentence, but was released two months later when the court suspended the sentences, pending a final judgement. But in December 2018 he was jailed for corruption again, this time for seven years, in relation to his family's ownership of steel mills in Saudi Arabia. He denies wrongdoing and accuses the military of conspiring to end his political career. When will he come back? Sharif has agreed to return within four weeks, or when doctors say he is fit to return. His brother Shahbaz - who is travelling with Sharif - signed a court document that said: ""If at any stage, the federal government has credible information that Nawaz Sharif is living abroad despite his fitness to travel, a representative from Pakistan's High Commission would have a right to meet with his physician(s) to verify or confirm about his health.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Khashoggi fiancée calls for Premier League to block Newcastle Saudi takeover,"Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi columnist, was killed in 2018 inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey. Western intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered his death - which he denies. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, led by the prince, looks set to acquire an 80% stake in the club. But lawyers speaking on behalf of Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fiancée, said the takeover should be blocked over the killing. What do we know about the takeover? Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle since 2007 and put the club up for sale in 2017. The proposed Saudi takeover is thought to be worth some £300 million. But it has already caused much controversy. The Saudi government has been accused of facilitating the theft of Premier League commercial rights, while Amnesty International has criticised the potential deal due to the country's dire human rights record. The country has also been accused of ""sportswashing"", a term used to describe countries that try to improve their international reputation by investing in major teams or hosting big sporting events. But these accusations have been rebuffed by the Saudi government, which claims it wants to get more of its people engaged in sport. What has Khashoggi's fiancée said? Lawyers for Ms Cengiz said in a letter on her behalf that the Premier League should block the takeover. ""It is undoubtedly the right, proper and lawful action for you (chief executive Richard Masters) and the Premier League to take, especially in light of the ruthless killing of Ms Cengiz's fiancée,"" the letter said. There should be no place in English football for anyone ""involved in such abhorrent acts"", it said. ""The standing of both the Premiership and English football in general would be tarnished by your connection with those who commit the most appalling crimes and then seek to whitewash them, and who seek to use English football as a way of improving their image and hiding their transgressions."" What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The journalist - who had gone into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017 - went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018, seeking papers to marry Ms Cengiz. Investigators believe that as she waited outside, the 59-year-old was murdered and then dismembered. Khashoggi's remains have never been found. The gruesome killing shocked the world and UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard said there was credible evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials were individually liable. A court in Saudi Arabia last year sentenced five people to death and jailed three others over his murder. Turkey has separately charged 20 suspects over the murder.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rihanna's Crop Over costume goes viral,"The 29-year-old had teased fans by uploading photos of her new turquoise hair on Instagram over the weekend. But the look was completed on Monday as she stepped out in a jewel-encrusted costume with green and pink feathers. (And not much else). ""We are not worthy,"" was one of many fan reactions on Twitter. Another added the singer ""officially killed me"" with the costume, while others said she was ""blessing the internet"". The posts also attracted the attention of Chris Brown - who left a comment on one of her Instagrams with the pair-of-eyes emoji. Many of her fans were less than pleased about this, telling him to ""keep his negative energy away"" from Rihanna and recalling his assault on the singer in 2009 when the pair were dating. What is Crop Over? Crop Over started in 1687 to mark the end of the sugar cane crop harvest. At the time, Barbados was the world's largest producer of sugar, but as the industry declined, so did the festival - and it was dropped in the 1940s. But the festival was revived in 1974 and has since become one huge party similar in style to Notting Hill Carnival - with lots of music, dancing and colourful costumes. The festival, which attracts tourists from around the world, runs from July and ends in early August with the Grand Kadooment Day. Rihanna has attended the finale parade several times over the last few years - and worn suitably attention-grabbing costumes at each of them. To be fair, temperatures are around 30C in Barbados at this time of year so she's just dressing sensibly for the weather, really. Part of Rihanna's outfit was designed by DBleudazzled - a line specialising in bedazzled costumes. The owner of the company, known as Bleu, told Billboard she had to provide the tights at very short notice - with Rihanna's team only requesting them last Wednesday. The rest of her outfit was put together by local designer Laura Austin, according to Vogue. ""Crop Over used to be celebrated with people wearing simple T-shirts,"" Austin said. ""Over the years however, designers started getting creative. Today it's very important to dress up in full costume to really and truly feel the Crop Over vibe. It's exhilarating, free, and radiant."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Royal barge Gloriana launched on River Thames in London,"The 94ft (28.6m) royal barge Gloriana was escorted through the streets of London on the back of a truck. It had been transported from a unit in Brentford to Isleworth, west London, where it was placed in the Thames. A pageant of more than 1,000 boats involving some 20,000 people will sail down the river on 3 June to mark the Queen's 60 years on the throne. The Queen will formally name the barge when she visits Greenwich next week to unveil the revamped Cutty Sark. The pageant, from Wandsworth to Tower Bridge, will be led by Gloriana, a rowbarge which will be powered by 18 oarsmen. Barge 'timeless' It will feature a seven-mile long procession of Dunkirk little ships, historic vessels, steam boats and tugs. The Gloriana, which is covered in gold leaf, will not carry any member of the Royal Family. Lord Sterling, who organised Jubilee celebrations in 2002, is behind the project which created the barge. He said the idea for a waterborne tribute to the Queen came from Prince of Wales and the vessel featured wood from sweet chestnut trees grown on Prince Charles's private estate. Lord Sterling said: ""I became enamoured with the idea of building something timeless and got inspiration from Canaletto's paintings that showed the great barges of the 18th Century and decided to build one. ""If we had to give it a style, it would be Regency. Including 18 rowers, it will carry 52 people. ""No-one's really built anything like this for 200 years and the way we've built it, it will last for 200 years if looked after. ""This has been a huge project. Something of this type would normally take a year or so to do it but we've done it in far less."" New music The team behind building the vessel, led by master-builder Mark Edwards, had been working 18-hour days to complete the project, which began last November. Music is a key feature of the celebrations, with pieces commissioned for the pageant receiving their premiere on special musical barges. Carol Ann Duffy, the poet laureate, has written the words for a new song with music by composer Orlando Gough. Ten film composers, including Downton Abbey composer John Lunn, were commissioned to devise a new movement inspired by the original titles of Handel's Water Music. The flotilla will feature 20,000 people on the water, travel under 14 bridges and take 90 minutes to pass any given point.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Birmingham prison inmates' letters laced with drugs,"The letters, marked as being from inmates' legal teams, were intercepted at HMP Birmingham in June. Staff's efforts emerged in a report on standards since an inspector called the prison the worst he had ever seen. Now a watchdog hopes improvements during the virus will help reshape the prison's future. HMP Birmingham's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) has been assessing progress for the 12 months since July 2019, when the government took over the site full time from private security firm G4S. The switch followed a raft of serious complaints over the prison which painted a picture of severe squalor, chronic danger and acute drugs misuse. But the IMB's annual report found ""rising trends in standards"", and that in general, inmates' experience had improved, with expectations ""this upward trajectory will continue"". Instances of violence and drug use have fallen, and the board concedes it is related, yet only in part, to prisoners spending most of the day in cells during the enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions. Amid national lockdown, the prison experienced an influx of letters laced with psychoactive substances (PS). They were marked as Rule 39 solicitors letters - messages between inmates and legal counsel that by law cannot be read by prisons unless contraband is suspected. Staff did suspect and found 330 pages of drug-coated paper; a move that left the board ""reassured the prison is diligent in tracking down illicit items"". The board added incidents of PS abuse were ""much lower"" than in recent years, and a body scanner was finally in place to detect drugs. In terms of violence, the board found the prison to be ""much safer"", with one officer reporting a ""transformation"". The fall in violence, the report said, predated the prison's Covid-19 lockdown, rolled out between March and July. Board members praised effective communication, ""outstanding management"" and staff teamwork in keeping the prison Covid-safe. The report concluded: ""The reduction although not elimination of the drug supply and bullying during lockdown has helped to create an environment within which many men have reported feeling safe. ""It is undoubtedly the case that staff-resident relationships have significantly improved during the lockdown. ""The challenge will be to maintain this in the future while also allowing a reasonable time out of cell."" During lockdown, inmates were in their cells 23-and-a-half hours a day. That concerned the board, but it said the move should be viewed in context of only three inmates testing positive for the virus, and inmates' general acceptance the move was for their safety.

Clara Ponsati arrest case is delayed,"Clara Ponsatí, 62, is charged with sedition. She denies all wrongdoing and said she would resist extradition. She was expected to report to police in Edinburgh on Thursday where she would be detained and arrested. However her lawyer Aamer Anwar said she would not attend because of ""glaring contradictions"" in the arrest warrant. Mr Anwar said the warrant was translated by a senior judge, Pablo Llarena, and the UK authorities are now seeking clarifications on the 59-page document. 'Rambling' warrant He added that Prof Ponsatí would instead hand herself in on 14 November at 11:00, pending any updates. He continued: ""There appears to be glaring contradictions contained in a 'rambling' warrant stretching to some 59 pages, which jumps from 'rebellion' to 'sedition', whilst Clara Ponsati is accused of sedition she is only briefly mentioned on two pages, with no clarity as to her role. ""We note the warrant begins with the activities of the 'independence' movement in December 2012, however Clara Ponsati only returned to become education minister on July 14th 2017. ""The warrant has now been returned to Spain seeking clarification, which means Prof Clara Ponsati will not be appearing at the Edinburgh police office on Thursday 7th November and the court hearing is cancelled."" It was confirmed the latest European warrant was issued on Tuesday after a previous warrant was withdrawn last summer. Prof Ponsatí, who was education minister in the Catalan government, again faces being sent to Spain to stand trial. The move comes after nine Catalan leaders were convicted of sedition over their role in an unsanctioned referendum on independence in 2017. Protests erupted in Barcelona last month after they were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison by Spain's Supreme Court. Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum. Speaking to BBC Political Correspondent Niall O'Gallagher, Prof Ponsati said: ""I feel a very intense feeling of outrage and injustice. ""A guilty verdict on the Catalan leaders is a guilty verdict on the Catalan people that went to the polls on the referendum day. So everyone will feel the verdict in their own souls."" Mr Anwar added: ""The shambolic 'arrogant' attempts at extradition by Spain should be a source of deep embarrassment to them. This is now Spain's third attempt to extradite Clara and they stand accused of abusing the European Arrest Warrant process. ""We are instructed to robustly defend Clara in what she claims to be a 'judicially motivated act of vengeance' against the Catalan politicians.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Barnsley Football Club coach sentenced for bribery,"Police said it was the first conviction in the UK relating to football industry corruption. Tommy Wright, Barnsley Football Club's ex-assistant head coach, was sentenced to 12 months, suspended for a year. Giuseppe ""Pino"" Pagliara, of Bury, and Dax Price, of Sittingbourne, were also sentenced at Southwark Crown Court. The three men were brought to trial after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph, which ""published a number of exposés of alleged corruption in English football"" in September 2016. During the trial, the court heard Wright, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was handed an envelope of £5,000 in cash by the newspaper's undercover reporter Claire Newell. More stories from around Yorkshire He is also understood to have leaked information about Barnsley players at a meeting in August 2016. The trial heard some of the players were encouraged to sign up with Pagliara and Price, who both broke football rules by acting as ""third-party"" owners of players in a bid to profit when they were sold on to other clubs. The men were found guilty in December. Wright, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was convicted of two charges of accepting a bribe in contravention of the Bribery Act 2000. Football agent Price, 48, was handed an 18-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, after being convicted of two charges of offering or promising a bribe contrary to the same act. Pagliara, 64, of Bury, another agent originally from Italy, was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years, after also being found guilty of two charges of offering or promising a bribe. Speaking after the trial, Det Con Chris Glover from the City of London Police's Fraud Squad, said: ""This case is the first in the UK relating to corruption in the football industry and shows how offending of this extremely serious nature can lead to significant prison sentences. ""We are pleased justice has now been done and would like to take this opportunity to thank the Telegraph, Football Association, Crown Prosecution Service and Barnsley Football Club for their assistance with this case.""

"Dr Michael Watt patient recall: Further 1,044 people recalled","It follows a review of patient notes relating to the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt. This further group are those who were seen by Dr Watt and discharged to the care of their GP. They had been prescribed certain medications for neurological conditions. Review appointments are being offered to ensure they are on the correct treatment. Concern was first raised about Dr Watt's treatment and diagnosis of some patients at the end of 2016. He is not currently treating patients. Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said the trust had provided a commitment that it would ""carefully consider anyone who had previously been seen by Dr Watt and discharged and then recall any key groups of people who, based on the advice of the consultant neurological team, required a review"". He added: ""Based on our learning from the initial recall of patients, individuals have now been identified by the specialised medicines they are being prescribed. Dr McBride apologised for ""any distress and uncertainty"" that this process brings. ""It is clearly our responsibility to act on clinical advice and the emerging outcomes from the first phase of the recall,"" he added. The new appointments are being arranged based on the clinical advice from consultant neurologists at the Belfast Trust. They will start this weekend and are scheduled to be completed within four months. Belfast Health and Social Care Trust Consultant Neurologist Dr John Craig said the primary focus was to ""provide assurance"" that patients are on the correct treatment. He requested patients should not stop, or make adjustments to their medication until they have been reviewed by a consultant neurologist at their appointment. ""It is crucial that anyone who does not receive a letter understands that they have no action to take and do not need to get in touch. ""This latest review process is being concentrated on specific groups of patients taking specific, specialised medicines,"" he added. A dedicated advice line - 0800 980 1100 - is in place for any concerns patients may have before an appointment. It is open Monday to Friday from 09:00 to 20:00 GMT. In October, the independent inquiry panel which is reviewing neurology services by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust announced details of its public engagement process. Questionnaires are being made available for the trust's neurology patients.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Council tax payers to pay more for North Wales Police,"The rise in the police precept means that Band D council tax payers will be charged an extra 17 pence per week. In his first budget since his election last November, Winston Roddick said the increase would provide another 51 police officers. The Police and Crime Panel approved the rise, and said the money should be ring-fenced for extra officers. In a report presented to the panel on Monday, Mr Roddick explained the above-inflation increase by saying: ""I want to ensure security in the home and safety in public places."" He said the extra officers would ""enable greater options to focus on reducing crime through preventative measures and reducing harm to communities"". The additional posts increase the number of officers in north Wales from 1,417 to 1,468. The rise means people in the North Wales force area are likely to continue paying more towards policing than any other area of England and Wales outside London. The panel is required to approve the precept rise before bills can be sent out, and approved the move unanimously. 'Hold him to account' One member, Labour councillor Chris Hughes, said: ""We need to give the commissioner a chance. ""He's recently been elected on a manifesto of providing extra officers. ""We can hold him to account if he doesn't deliver."" Mr Roddick told the meeting he will make it a new priority to deal with rural crime, particularly thefts from farms. He said afterwards: ""There's a very real problem about rural crime, and we have cut back on the previous system of there being two dedicated officers responsible for policing rural crime. ""Those positions were got rid of because of the cutbacks, and that's been a constant source of concern to farmers. ""It's a big concern. They lose animals, diesel, quad bikes, gates and in one case, even a JCB."" The commissioner also said he has asked North Wales Police to establish a dedicated rape unit to improve policing of sexual assault and domestic violence incidents. Monday's meeting in Conwy also saw Anna Humphreys appointed as chief executive to the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner at a salary of around £75,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Africa development: Young 'Einsteins' make their pitch,"The Next Einstein Forum wants to turn Africa into a global hub for science and technology by bringing the continent's top brains together with investors and policymakers. As part of their quest to ensure the next Einstein comes from the continent, young African scientists were asked to come up with innovations that could ""solve a big problem for humanity"". No pressure, then. Here is a summary of the top three ideas, as chosen by the NEF's panel of expert judges. Winner: Moses Bangura, Engineer, Sierra Leone Innovation: Medical drone network Mr Bangura wants to use a fleet of electrically powered drones, which could be used to deliver treatment to patients in hard-to-reach areas. The unmanned aerial vehicles could serve a double purpose, both delivering essentials like medicine or emergency fluids, and also taking away blood or other samples for testing. The drones would be able to bypass traffic congestion, a major problem in many African cities, as well as reach rural areas with poor road networks. They would be able to fly with an 8kg (17lb) payload for 40 minutes, covering a radius of 40km (25 miles). ""We believe that the geographical location of someone cannot determine whether they receive an available life-saving drug,"" Mr Bangura says. Runners-Up: Moussa Thiam, Mali Innovation: Transforming rubbish into building materials Mr Thiam's plan is take plastic waste, the build-up of which is a massive problem for so many cities across the continent, and turn it into something that can be used for the public good, such as building roads or pavements. Many of the plastics that end up in African landfills or clog up urban drainage systems take more than 100 years to biodegrade naturally. The project would build on existing research showing that plastic waste can be used to create materials that act as a substitute or part-substitute for cement, when combined with sand and gravel. ""[The innovation would lead to] a healthier environment, with a reduction in both pollution and the cost of building materials,"" Mr Thiam says. Sylvia Mukasa, Kenya Innovation: Mobile health information service for mothers Ms Mukasa's idea, named Afya Mama, is to use mobile phones to provide women with better information about health issues surrounding pregnancy, immunisation, family planning and HIV/Aids. Pregnant women, healthcare workers and others would get health advice by SMS, or by making a phone call and selecting pre-recorded audio content. The messages could be pre-recorded in any language and selected using Interactive Voice Response technology, meaning the service could cover the more than 40 ethnic dialects in Kenya. ""Our objective is to consistently sensitise mothers with information on healthcare and best practices, linking them up with an expert in the case of emergency,"" Ms Mukasa says.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Questions over school holiday fine pay-back in Wales,"Education Minister Huw Lewis has written to councils to say it was wrong to tell head teachers to ban all term-time leave. It came after 2,000 people signed a petition against the £60 fines. The Welsh government said any reimbursement of fines was an issue for individual councils to look into. Hundreds of people were fined after some councils, concerned about absentee rates, advised head teachers that there was a blanket ban on term-time leave. Mr Lewis intervened to clarify that such a ban breached Welsh government regulations. He reiterated pupils were allowed up to 10 days away at head teachers' discretion, with leave ""considered fairly and on its merits"". 'Last resort' Craig Langman, from the campaign group Parents Want A Say, said the minister had brought ""common sense back to this whole policy"". He had written to him again to try to establish if any parents would be able to claim money back from the fines, Mr Langman told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme. ""If it turns out that actually you are allowed to reclaim that fine, then we will be telling everyone to do so,"" he said. However, the Welsh government said individual councils would have to look into the issue as they imposed the fines. Rob Williams, a former head teacher and now director of policy at the National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said it might not be as simple as reimbursing all fines. ""You would hope those penalty notices were only being issued as a very very last resort,"" he said, also speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad. ""It depends on the individual circumstances of each of those cases. ""There are some rare circumstances where on a pattern of absences, if it becomes a larger pattern, research points out that if pupils have a low attendance within school it can have a detrimental affect on their future life chances. ""You have to look at it in a broader picture and not just on a fine that has been issued on a single holiday absence."" 'Educating parents' A BBC Wales Freedom of Information request in 2015 found wide variations in policy of imposing fines. While Cardiff council issued 370 penalty notices between January and May, 10 other councils did not issue any. Cardiff council, which had the highest number of fines, said: ""In Cardiff we have been very clear that head teachers have the discretion to consider requests for term-time absences and that penalty notices are just one of the ways schools can tackle poor attendance, including educating parents on the negative impact taking their children out of school has on exam results.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Nazi art' hoarder Gurlitt makes Swiss museum sole heir,"The reclusive son of Adolf Hitler's art dealer is estimated to have amassed a collection worth up to a billion euros. The museum said the news struck ""like a bolt from the blue"", given that it had had no relationship with Mr Gurlitt. The collection was the subject of a long legal dispute over works that may have been taken illegally by the Nazis. The Bern Art Museum said that it was delighted at the news that it had been made Mr Gurlitt's ""unrestricted and unfettered sole heir"", but added that the bequest also posed some questions. ""The Board of Trustees and directors of Kunstmuseum Bern are surprised and delighted, but at the same time do not wish to conceal the fact that this magnificent bequest brings with it a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature"", it said in a statement. Mr Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was ordered to deal in works that had been seized from Jews, or which the Nazis considered ""degenerate"" and had removed from German museums. The priceless collection was confiscated in 2012 by Bavarian authorities from the apartment of his son. After initially refusing to give up the paintings, Mr Gurlitt changed his position, agreeing to co-operate with the German authorities on establishing the paintings' provenance, and returning them if they were shown to be stolen. 'Wild speculation' Mr Gurlitt, who had no close relatives, wrote the will within the last few weeks shortly before undergoing heart surgery, according to his spokesman, Stephan Holzinger. ""It now falls to the probate court to determine if the will is valid and whether a contract of inheritance exists,"" he told the BBC earlier on Wednesday. ""I can understand that there is now wild speculation, but I don't want to comment on that at this stage."" The German government said earlier that the collector's death would not affect the investigation into ownerships claims on the paintings. Mr Gurlitt's collection only came to light after a routine check found he was carrying wads of cash on a train from Switzerland, triggering a tax inquiry. Investigators found more than 1,400 works in his flat in Munich in February 2012 - though they only revealed the discovery in late 2013 - and a further 60 in his house near Salzburg, Austria, earlier this year. Among them were works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Emil Nolde and Max Liebermann. The collection is estimated to be worth up to a billion euros (£850m; $1.35bn). Under German law, Cornelius Gurlitt was not compelled to return any paintings because the incidents happened more than 30 years ago.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grenfell Tower study: Cancer-causing chemicals found nearby,"Research by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) says dust and debris from the fire have polluted the surrounding area. People living near the tower have complained of health problems from vomiting and coughing up blood to skin complaints and breathing difficulties. The government said the risk to health was ""generally very low"". Soil samples were gathered six months after the fire by Professor Anna Stec, who said the levels of toxic chemicals found were ""many times higher than normal"". She said: ""Fires release a rich cocktail of pollutants, many of them acutely or chronically toxic. ""There is an increased risk of a number of health problems to those in the local area, from asthma to cancer."" The team from UCLan analysed soil and debris samples taken from six locations up to 1.2km from Grenfell Tower. The study uncovered ""significant environmental contamination"" in the surrounding area, including in oily deposits collected 17 months after the tragedy. Based on the level of chemicals discovered, researchers concluded there was an increased risk of a number of health problems to those in the area. 'Upsetting to read' Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United, said the findings were ""alarming and hugely upsetting to read"". She said: ""Twenty-one months after the fire the government has yet to carry out a single soil test or offer a proper health screening programme to the community. ""When this report first came to light in October last year, it was left to the bereaved and survivors of Grenfell to fight for government and professional experts to meet with our community. ""Testing in the community must start immediately and by immediately, we mean yesterday."" Researchers said the substances were discovered in quantities that could indicate they resulted from the burning of specific materials used in the 2016 refurbishment of the tower. Prof Stec said there was a need for further analysis to ""quantify any risk"" of conditions such as cancer, asthma and other respiratory problems. She added: ""There is undoubtedly evidence of contamination in the area surrounding the tower, which highlights the need for further in-depth, independent analysis to quantify any risks to residents. ""It is now crucial to put in place long-term health screening to assess any long-term adverse health effects of the fire on local residents, emergency responders and clean-up workers."" Public Health England has been monitoring air quality around the tower since the fire and said in a report last week the ""the risk to public health from air pollution remains low"". The government announced that further environmental checks were to be carried out around Grenfell Tower last year. A spokesman said: ""We take Professor Stec's findings extremely seriously and fully appreciate the ongoing health concerns. ""We have established a comprehensive programme of environmental checks to fully assess the risks and take appropriate action. ""Professor Stec is part of an independent group of scientists overseeing this work and her findings will inform the checks we are conducting.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Baby Lynlee 'born twice' after life-saving tumour surgery,"At 16 weeks pregnant, Margaret Hawkins Boemer discovered her daughter, Lynlee Hope, had a tumour on her spine. The mass, known as a sacrococcygeal teratoma, was diverting blood from the foetus - raising the risk of fatal heart failure. Baby Lynlee weighed just 1lb 3oz (0.53kg) when surgeons opened the womb. Mrs Boemer had originally been expecting twins, but lost one of her babies before the second trimester. She was initially advised to terminate her pregnancy entirely before doctors at Texas Children's Fetal Center suggested the risky surgery. The tumour and the unborn baby were almost the same size by the time the operation was performed. Lynlee was given a 50% chance of survival. Mrs Boemer told CNN: ""At 23 weeks, the tumour was shutting her heart down and causing her to go into cardiac failure, so it was a choice of allowing the tumour to take over her body or giving her a chance at life. ""It was an easy decision for us: We wanted to give her life."" 'Her heart stopped' Doctor Darrell Cass of Texas Children's Fetal Centre was one of the team who carried out the surgery. He said the tumour had been so large that a ""huge"" incision was required to reach it, leaving the baby ""hanging out in the air"". Lynlee's heart virtually stopped during the procedure but a heart specialist kept her alive while most of the tumour was removed, he added. The team then placed her back in her mother's womb and sewed her uterus up. 'Second life' for Indian baby girl left to die Premature babies' mums want more leave Mrs Boemer spent the next 12 weeks on bedrest, and Lynlee entered the world for the second time on 6 June. She was born via Caesarean at almost full term, weighing 5Ib and 5oz, and named after both of her grandmothers. When Lynlee was eight days old, a further operation helped remove the rest of the tumour from her tailbone. Dr Cass said the baby girl was now home and thriving. ""Baby Boemer is still an infant but is doing beautiful,"" he confirmed. Sacrococcygeal teratoma is a rare form of tumour seen in one out of 30,000-70,000 live births. Its cause is unknown but baby girls are affected four times more often than boys.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Durham's Lumiere light festival returns to city,"Debuting in 2009, everything from buildings and bridges to shop windows and major attractions were turned into canvases of light by artists. The last festival attracted more than 75,000 people to the city over the three nights of innovative light installations. The programme for this year's festival, taking place from Thursday 17 to Sunday 20 November, has not yet been revealed. The first festival saw several installations including images projected on to Durham Cathedral and a trail of sound and light at the Botanic Gardens.

End war against media - UNP,"Opposition and United National Party (UNP) leader, Ranil Wickramasinghe, said that he expects ""the government will stop the war against journalists as the war is now coming to an end"". Speaking to journalists in Colombo, he said the UNP is hopeful of winning the Western Provincial Council (WPC) elections held on Saturday. The ruling and opposition parties and election monitors have all admitted that the polling in three districts have been mainly peaceful. 'Terrorising' minority voters However, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) accused the authorities of intimidating minority voters in the run up to the polls. SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem told BBC Sandeshaya that authorities used ""state terror"" using underworld elements to get minority votes in Colombo suburbs. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) echoed similar accusations. JVP Colombo district leader Duminda Nagamuwa told BBC’s Elmo Fernando that the government is ""terrorising"" opposition parties using the war against the LTTE as a pretext. The UNP has accused the ruling United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of threatening polling booth agents of opposition parties. Denying the accusation, UPFA general secretary, Education Minister Susil Premjayantha said there was no need for the polling agents as nobody could vote without an identity card. ID cards However, many voters were prevented exercising their democratic right as a result, says the monitoring group Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE). “We are concerned that many people could not vote as they did not have identity cards,” CaFEE spokesman Keerthi Tennakoon told BBC Sandeshaya after the elections. Udaya Gammanpila, a UPFA candidate who represents Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said that the West is afraid to overthrow popular governments after ""experience in Vietnam"". Dr. Vickramabahu Karunarathne, leader of the Left Front, said the voters were not keen on casting their vote on Saturday. He accused the government of ""imprisoning"" over 200,000 people in camps while accusing the LTTE of keeping the civilians as a human shiled. The leader of the Western Peoples Front, Mano Ganeshan, said the WPC election was an important platform for the Tamil minority in Colombo to express their opinion on the current situation in Sri Lanka.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Yahoo tests ear-based smartphone identification system,"It is also looking to use fists or even the way people grip their smartphone as alternative forms of biometric authentication. Fingerprint scanners on mobile phones are increasingly popular, but expensive. Yahoo is looking to use the phone's touchscreen as the image sensor, which would be far cheaper. The system, developed at Yahoo Labs, is dubbed Bodyprint and has had initial trials with 12 participants. ""Due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor,"" the team said on its website. While the input resolution of a touchscreen is relatively low, ""the surface area is large, allowing the touch sensor to scan users' body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists and palms by pressing them against the display"", the team said. It identified body parts with 99.98% accuracy and users with 99.5% accuracy. Scanning ears achieved a 99.8% accuracy rate, according to the team. Swiss robbers Biometrics expert Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London's department of computer science, thinks that such a system could have a future as a way of opening mobile phones securely. ""Research into this has been going on for a few years, but it is new in terms of deployment,"" she said. It was not the first time ears had been used as a method of identification, she said. In Switzerland such methods are used at the scene of a robbery, to help identify the offender. ""Burglars tend to listen on the windowpane to see if anyone is home,"" said Prof Sasse. Police then take a print of the ear, rather like a fingerprint. One benefit of an ear-based identification system was that it offered greater privacy than facial recognition, she told the BBC. Fingerprint scanners, popular on latest iPhone models and on some Android handsets, have proved to be vulnerable to hackers. In April, security firm FireEye reported how hackers could take copies of fingerprints used to unlock the Samsung Galaxy S5 phone. The latest research into biometrics is focused on behavioural biometrics, for example how you type a word, which can be extremely accurate, according to Prof Sasse.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy,"The move by the Weinstein Company is intended to facilitate a buy-out offer from a private equity firm. The film and TV studio also said it was releasing any victims of Mr Weinstein's alleged misconduct from non-disclosure deals stopping them from speaking out. Mr Weinstein, 66, insists sexual relations he had were consensual. He was fired as chairman of the Weinstein Company last October when the allegations were first reported. Once a powerhouse of the entertainment industry, the company will be known as the first high-profile firm that went into bankruptcy as a direct result of workplace sexual misconduct, the BBC's Nick Bryant in New York reports. What did the Weinstein Company say? On Monday, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - a move permitting its reorganisation. The Weinstein Company - which was co-founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob in 2005 - also announced a ""stalking-horse"" agreement with Lantern Capital Partners private equity firm. The deal means that the private equity firm would buy assets if this is approved by a bankruptcy court. ""While we had hoped to reach a sale out of court, the board is pleased to have a plan for maximising the value of its assets, preserving as many jobs as possible and pursuing justice for any victims,"" the Weinstein Company chairman Bob Weinstein said in a statement. The Weinstein Company, which was behind films including The King's Speech and The Artist, has been under intense pressure over the sexual assault allegations against co-founder Harvey Weinstein. What about non-disclosure agreements? In a statement, the company said: ""Since October, it's been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers,"" the company said in a statement. ""Effective immediately, those 'agreements' end. No-one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet."" The move was heralded by New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as a watershed moment, one that would finally enable voices that for too long have been muzzled to be heard. Although it is not yet clear how many people can now speak out. Mr Weinstein has been accused of rape, sexual assault and harassment, but has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual relationships.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What to expect from Lady Gaga's Super Bowl half-time show,"She says the performance on Sunday will uphold philosophies of ""love and kindness"". The singer was asked if she'd be making a stand against US President Donald Trump at the event in Houston, Texas. ""The only statements I'll be making are the ones that I have been consistently making during my career,"" she said. ""I believe in a passion for inclusion, I believe in the spirit of equality and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness."" Lady Gaga was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's rival Hillary Clinton during the US election. After his victory, she was pictured standing outside Trump Tower in New York with a sign saying, ""Love trumps hate"". In January the NFL denied that it would gag the singer from making political statements during her show. ""This performance is for everyone,"" she said. ""I want to, more than anything, create a moment that everyone that's watching will never forget. ""I think that music is one of the most powerful things the world has to offer, no matter what race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, gender that you are, it has the power to unite us."" More than 100 million people are expected to tune in to watch the championship game of the National Football League, with its now legendry half-time performances. It's become a platform for stars to make political points. Last year Beyonce's show seemed to be inspired by the radical political group the Black Panthers. It was at a time of mass protests across America over police killings of young black men. Coldplay also used their set last year to pay tribute to marriage equality.

EU and Turkey agreement on deporting migrants and visas,"The deal also establishes a roadmap for lifting visa requirements for Turks travelling to the EU. Visa-free status is expected in three years' time. Turkey is a major transit country for Asians and Africans heading for the EU. Ankara has set up special camps for thousands of Syrian refugees, but other migrants often face great hardship. Greece, where migrant reception centres are overcrowded, stepped up security on its land border with Turkey in August 2012. But the EU border agency Frontex says in its 2013 risk analysis report that detections of illegal migrants on boats in the Aegean Sea, between Turkey and Greece, increased by 912% later that year. In the past, human rights organisations, including the UN refugee agency UNHCR, have strongly criticised Greece and Italy for ""push-backs"" - a policy of sending migrants back to their point of departure. Under international law, groups of migrants are supposed to be checked for legitimate asylum claims. Bulgaria, an EU member, has struggled to cope with large numbers of irregular migrants - especially Syrians - arriving from Turkey. Bulgaria is not in the EU's Schengen passport-free zone, where border checks are minimal, but Greece is. Ketty Kehayioylou of the UNHCR in Greece said migrants were taking more dangerous routes since the land border with Turkey was fenced off last year. The situation of Syrian refugees remains precarious in Greece, she told the BBC. Unlike other migrants, Syrians are now given a six-month suspension of deportation. But that temporary permit does not entitle them to such things as a place stay, food or medical assistance, she said. Long negotiations Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the new deal with the EU a ""milestone"". Mr Erdogan said Turkey was no longer a country that people ""escape from, but one that people return to"". ""We are not a country that is a burden [to the EU] but one that takes away its burdens,"" he said. ""The visa requirements should have been removed long ago. The fact that they haven't been removed yet has only harmed the European Union."" Turkey wants to join the EU and negotiations began in 2005, but progress has been slow, amid EU concern about human rights abuses. Turkey is carrying out various judicial reforms in an effort to meet EU standards. EU leaders complained about the Turkish police crackdown on anti-government protesters in June, and Turkey's long-running dispute with Cyprus has also been a stumbling block. Turkey's EU accession negotiations resumed last month. Two years of talks led up to the migrants/visa deal. Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper says they narrowed their differences only after Ankara was assured that it could suspend the readmission agreement in the event that an EU member country blocked visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Austria bans 'hidden' neo-Nazi codes on car number plates,"Letter combinations such as HJ or NS - denoting Hitler Youth and National Socialism - have long been prohibited on personalised plates in Austria. Now transport officials have published a list of more than 30 more cryptic codes that have been banned. They include number combinations such as 88, which represents ""Heil Hitler"". New legislation, which came into force on Thursday, also outlaws the use of IS or ISIS on personalised number plates in a bid to stop people showing their support for the Islamic State group. 'No place in society' ""It has been forbidden to have obvious Nazi number plates since personalised plates went on sale in 1989,"" a spokeswoman for Austria's transport ministry told the BBC. ""But then we learned that the far-right scene is moving away from the more obvious codes to more hidden ones. ""So we had to change the law. Civil servants deciding if someone can choose a certain number plate now know which codes are being used by the far-right scene."" Austria number plate ban Combinations no longer allowed include: Only new number plates will be affected by the change in the law. Abbreviations now outlawed include FG, which stands for ""Fuehrer's Geburtstag"", meaning ""leader's birthday"", and WP for ""white power"". Number combinations have not previously been included, but now codes such as 18 - meaning 'Adolf Hitler' because of where A and H come in the alphabet - are also now prohibited. The new list was compiled in co-operation with the Mauthausen Committee, an organisation representing former concentration camp prisoners. Officials say it is not exhaustive. Austrian Transport Minister Alois Stoeger, who pushed for the law change, has said: ""National Socialist ideology has no place in our society."" More than half a million Austrians have currently personalised licence plates, according to Austria's public broadcaster, ORF. The move in Austria follows similar efforts in Germany to crack down on neo-Nazi symbols. In Germany, the law says that number plates must not offend public morals. Each state has its own list of banned combinations, and some are stricter than others. But attempts to introduce a federal solution, similar to that in Austria, have been unsuccessful so far.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Egypt: Telecoms boss Sawiris confident of change,"Naguib Sawiris, chairman of Orascom Telecom, Egypt's largest mobile phone network, told World Business News that the demonstrations would not stop until Egypt moved towards democracy. Mr Sawiris added that he would like to see a new president, but praised Hosni Mubarak for not fleeing the country. He said that would have caused turmoil. Investment insurance ""Politicians now understand that unless they provide the people of Egypt with the real democratic needs they have, with the real right to live and work, and get a decent job, they will not be allowed to stay,"" said Mr Sawiris, speaking from Egyptian Red Sea resort of El Gouna. Mr Sawiris added that the Egyptian business community also wanted democracy because ""it is the best insurance of investment"". He also denied that corruption was a widespread problem in the country, saying that ""Egypt, with all respect, is the least corrupt country in the Middle East"". Mr Sawiris said that while there was corruption in Egypt, it was mainly to be found within the government bureaucracy. Despite running the country's largest telecoms company, he denied that he was close to the former government. He confirmed that his mobile phone network was temporarily shut down by the government, a decision he described as ""stupid"". Pent-up demand Speaking from Cairo, Simon Kitchen, a strategist at investment bank EFG Hermes, said he was confident that business in Egypt would soon bounce back from the turmoil caused by the protests. ""During the day, you do see traffic on the roads [of Cairo] and people attempting to deliver goods,"" he said. ""Obviously tourism has been hit, but you do still see people at some of the hotels. ""Tourism does employ around 10% of the population, but you must remember that a lot of tourism is well away from Cairo. ""The key is if we see a fairly rapid resolution to this crisis, there is a lot of pent-up demand in the Egyptian economy that could be released. And some parts are already coming back to life."" 'Happy' Mr Sawiris also said that his business had suffered from attacks by protesters. ""My shops have been attacked and ransacked, and my main buildings have also been attacked,"" he said. Despite this, Mr Sawiris said he remained positive about Egypt's future. ""I'm not dismayed, I'm actually happy,"" he said. ""I have been a big advocate of democracy for a long time.""

Coronavirus: Beijing tightens controls amid spike in local cases,"There were 27 new cases reported on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106 people over five days. A Chinese official has described the new outbreak in the capital as ""extremely severe"". For more than seven weeks Beijing had only registered cases from people travelling in from abroad. New clusters of coronavirus are ""always a concern"", said Mike Ryan, emergencies programme head at the World Health Organization. ""But what we do like to see is an immediate response to that and comprehensive set of measures,"" he added. What do we know about the new cases? The fresh outbreak has been linked to the city's largest wholesale market, Xinfadi. Local media reports say the virus was discovered on chopping boards used for imported salmon at the market, prompting major supermarkets in Beijing to pull the fish from their shelves. The general manager of the market has been dismissed, along with other local officials. In his comments though, the WHO's Mike Ryan was cautious about the source of the outbreak, saying the suggestion it was carried on salmon or its packaging was only a ""hypothesis"". Other health experts have pointed to cross-contamination as being a more likely cause. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the virus strain found in Beijing did not resemble the type circulating across the rest of the country, and the WHO has urged China to share the genetic sequencing. What's being done to combat the outbreak? The market was shut early on Saturday and restrictions imposed on nearby neighbourhoods. Residents living near the market have been told they can't leave the city. All taxis are also now banned from driving beyond the city limits. By Monday Beijing had set up nearly 200 testing sites and contacted about 200,000 people who had visited the market since the end of May, state news outlet Xinhua reported. Volunteers at security checkpoints tested residents' temperatures. The lockdown has also been extended to 21 residential compounds close to the market. Indoor sporting and entertainment venues across Beijing have been ordered to close, as have many schools. The concerns over a second outbreak come as Beijing attempts to return to normal life. China reported the first coronavirus cases last year, but new cases and infections have dropped drastically as hotspots have developed elsewhere in the world.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Northern Ireland needs a 'unionism professor',"Mr Aiken said the post would help the university's ""badly-needed outreach to the unionist community"" and celebrate Northern Ireland's centenary. A number of events are already planned for the 2021 anniversary. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she would be ""very, very happy"" to support Mr Aiken's ""laudable"" suggestion. The UUP leader made his comments in the assembly chamber on Monday. Mr Aiken welcomed the decision of the Vice-Chancellor of Queen's, Prof Ian Greer, to hold a ceremony on Remembrance Sunday to commemorate the university's students killed in the world wars. In response, Ms Dodds agreed with Mr Aiken. ""I think it's also hugely important for Queen's University to make such remembrance a priority and for the vice-chancellor to make it a priority given the very considerable concerns that there has been in sections of our community around some of the decisions in the university in recent days,"" she said. 'Badly-needed outreach' Mr Aiken then asked the minister to ""encourage"" the university to set up a new academic post to study unionism's contribution to Northern Ireland. ""Could she therefore as part of the centenary celebrations that will be undertaken next year for our 100th anniversary, could she encourage the university as part of its badly-needed outreach to the unionist community to set up an endowed chair at the university to study unionism and its contribution to Northern Ireland?"" An ""endowed chair"" is a specially funded professorship in a university. Mr Aiken said it would be ""particularly apposite"" if the post was named after Edgar Graham. Mr Graham was a Queen's University law lecturer and Ulster Unionist Party assembly member shot dead by the IRA in 1983. A forum has been set up by the UK government to provide advice on plans to mark the centenary in 2021. Mrs Dodds said her department was also making preparations. ""We are looking at the economic powerhouse that Northern Ireland was at the beginning and in its creation and looking firmly into the future at how we can develop the economy of Northern Ireland in a way that sees it fit for purpose within its second century,"" she said. ""These, I think, are exciting events for us all.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tajikistan special forces chief Gulmurod Khalimov 'joins IS',"Gulmurod Khalimov is seen in the footage dressed in black and holding a gun. He went missing in early May. He says he joined IS in protest at Tajikistan's policy towards religion, which he says is anti-Islamic. Hundreds of Central Asians are thought have left for Syria, but this is the first known case of such a high profile officer joining the militants. The authorities in Tajikistan have refused to comment on his whereabouts since his disappearance, reports the BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov in Almaty. 'Slaughter' Khalimov used to fight extremists at home and was one of the best trained officers in the country, our correspondent says. In the video, which is believed to have been recorded in a Syrian camp, he says he plans to return to Tajikistan and ""bring slaughter"". He voices his disillusionment with the Tajik police and talks about the hardship of thousands of Tajik working migrants in Russia. Analysis: Khayrullo Fayz, BBC Central Asian Service The news of a high profile Tajik commander joining IS is bound to have shocked Tajikistan's authoritarian government. YouTube - where Gulmurod Khalimov's video could be seen - was blocked almost immediately. So far no officials have been available for comment. It's an unprecedented case for Tajikistan. Khalimov did not belong to the thousands of Muslims in the country routinely targeted by a government intent on fighting what it sees as extremism, but was part of the very security establishment meant to counter such threats. Many in Tajikistan are puzzled by the speed of his departure; after all he was still working in the country in April. With Central Asian militants now battling Afghan security forces just across the border in Afghanistan, the authorities in Dushanbe will be extremely concerned about the wider implications. Khalimov's position and profile are significant enough to potentially influence other members of the security forces. There are no official figures for the number of Tajik citizens fighting alongside Islamic State, but in January sources in the security services were quoted saying they range from 200 to 500. Central Asian fighters have also formed their own groups such as Sabri Jamaat and Imam Bukhari Jamaat, the BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov says. Many of these militants have reportedly been seen in major battles in Syrian cities, including Aleppo, Kobane and lately in Palmyra.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Do India's political parties condone corruption?,"Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent Last year, India's most respected election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms informed us that nearly a third of MPs - 158 of 543 - in the parliament faced criminal charges. New research has now thrown up more bad news. After examining affidavits filed by candidates to the Election Commission at the time of contesting elections, the watchdog found that a third of all lawmakers at the centre and all states - or 1,448 of 4,835 - faced criminal charges. A total of 641 declared serious criminal cases like rape, murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, robbery and extortion, among other things. The watchdog also found that 98 candidates facing corruption cases were given tickets by various political parties during general and state elections in the last five years. Thirty-six of them have won the polls. They include seven MPs and 29 state legislators. All parties appear to be responsible for this disturbing state of affairs. The Congress party, which has promised people stronger anti-corruption laws, actually gave tickets to 24 candidates facing corruption charges in general and state assembly polls in the last five years. The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gave tickets to five such candidates. Six key regional parties gave away tickets to 35 such candidates. During the last general elections alone, 15 candidates with corruption cases against them were given tickets by political parties - the Congress party awarded four such candidates. There's more. A total of 80 candidates facing corruption charges have been given tickets by political parties in elections to state assemblies in the last five years. Twenty-nine of them have won the elections and are currently serving as lawmakers. The majority (eight) belong to the Congress party, and most of the winners (seven) are from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. All this makes for very depressing news. It also makes many wonder whether India's political parties can ever be serious about fighting corruption when they condone it so openly. When will they stop giving tickets to candidates facing criminal and corruption charges? What about ""fast-tracking"" the cases against MPs and legislators facing these charges? The political class is totally silent on these matters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh assembly vote to ban for unstaffed tanning salons,"Stricter controls on the use of sunbeds were nodded through the Senedd by AMs on Tuesday Under-18s will be banned from using sunbeds from 8 April. The ban is meant to reduce cases of skin cancer by protecting youngsters from the dangers of overexposure to ultra-violet radiation. It follows a number of cases in Wales where children have been badly burned. Tanning salons will be required to supervise all adults using sun beds from 31 October as part of further regulations from Health Minister Edwina Hart. The Welsh Assembly Government said the controls it was introducing went further than those in the rest of the UK. The action by the assembly government was made possible by a private members bill in the UK Parliament introduced by the former Cardiff North MP Julie Morgan. It means tanning salons will have to provide protective eyewear to adults using sun beds. They will also have to display specifically approved health information about the effects of sun beds. A study by Cancer Research UK in 2009 commissioned by the minister found that 8.2% of children in Wales aged 11-17 had used a sun bed at least once. Another 16% said they may use one in future. More than 40% of children responding to the survey said they had used the tanning equipment unsupervised. Mrs Hart said: ""The impact of cancer on individuals and their families is potentially devastating and as a government we remain committed to doing all that we can to tackle cancer. 'Prevention and education' ""While our main focus is to protect children and young people, the regulations also provide the requirement for sunbed operators to provide more advice and protection for adults."" Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Tony Jewell said: ""Rates of skin cancer have increased in recent years and this is partly related to increasing exposure to ultra-violet radiation. ""We are concerned about the increased use of sunbeds, particularly by young people, and these regulations will help to reduce the risks of skin damage and cancer. ""This is part of our investment in prevention and education to reduce the incidence of cancer in Wales.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
GameStop: Real Wolf of Wall Street warns 'you could lose it all',"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News Jordan Belfort, who was jailed for market manipulation in 1999, said such investments could be ""great on the way up, but painful on the way down"". GameStop shares surged 700% last week as amateurs, inspired by tips shared on social media, piled into the stock. But they have dropped sharply since. Shares fell 63% on Tuesday to $81 - a far cry from last week's record of almost $350. Mr Belfort said he sympathised with the small-time traders drawn to GameStop, many of whom wanted to turn the tables on big Wall Street firms. But he told the BBC: ""You must be so careful because eventually these stocks are going to come crashing back down to earth. ""If you are looking at this as a way to make your living, you'll have to catch a falling knife on the way down. I would urge people to take their chips off the table."" The trading frenzy began in late January, when small-time investors began buying up shares in GameStop, a loss-making video games retailer. Many Wall Street hedge funds - known as ""short sellers"" - had bet against the firm, meaning they stood to make money if its stock fell, but lose heavily if it rose. But amateurs, inspired by posts on Reddit and Youtube, realised they could drive up the price if they bought en masse, inflicting losses on the big players and making gains for themselves. The excitement also encompassed other stocks such as AMC and Nokia, while the price of silver has seen intense speculation. 'Real danger' Mr Belfort said the trading had taken on a political tone, with investors seeking ""justice"" against Wall Street firms they perceived had behaved unethically. He added: ""All of a sudden there is a way for people to communicate on message boards like Reddit, there's a way for them to trade instantly on platforms like Robinhood. ""You put those two things together with the power of social media and bam - just like that the little guy got the best of the big institutions."" However, he said there was a risk of people getting swept away in the excitement, noting that those with little understanding of stocks were now buying GameStop shares. ""Be aware of being the last person on the bandwagon, that is really the danger here."" Mr Belfort, who is now an author and motivational speaker, defrauded investors of $200m in the 1980s and 90s and is still paying restitution to his victims. His memoir was the inspiration for Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street film in 2013, but he sued the film's producers for fraud and breach of contract last year claiming $300m in compensation. Mr Belfort alleged Red Granite Productions - whose co-founder Riza Aziz was arrested on suspicion of money laundering last year - lied about being ""legitimately funded"" when he sold the rights to his story. The company's lawyer described the lawsuit as ""desperate and supremely ironic"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Military Wives single is 'fastest selling in six years',"The Official Charts Company said 319,000 copies of the choir's song, Wherever You Are, were sold by midnight on Tuesday. The company said it was ""an extraordinary result"". The single is outselling nearest rival, Cannonball by X Factor winners Little Mix, by a margin of six to one. The song by Little Mix, the first group to ever win the X Factor, topped the charts on Sunday. Love poems Last week Little Mix sold 210,000 copies of their Damien Rice cover record, considerably lower than previous X Factor winners. The Official Charts Company said 242,000 copies of Wherever You Are were sold in two days, making it the fastest-selling single in six years. The last time a single sold so well in its first two days was when X Factor winner Shayne Ward shifted 313,000 copies of That's My Goal in 2005. The Treasury has announced it will waive the VAT on the Military Wives single, by making a equivalent donation to the charities benefiting from its sale. Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Our armed forces demonstrate incredible commitment to the nation and make sacrifices for all of us. ""The Military Wives choir is doing a great job of raising money for this hugely worthy cause. ""We will donate the tax collected on the single so that as much as possible of the money spent by the public on this fantastic song goes to charities helping our armed forces and their families this Christmas."" The single originates from the BBC Two programme The Choir, which saw Gareth Malone create a choral group from the wives and partners of military personnel who have been deployed to Afghanistan. The lyrics of Wherever You Are were taken from love poems, which were written between the women and their absent husbands. Royal Wedding composer Paul Mealor wrote the music. The choir performed the song at the Royal British Legion's Festival Of Remembrance earlier this year. The track has become the fifth fastest selling single since 1994, when sales were first tracked. The fastest selling single is Elton John's Candle In The Wind, which was released in 1997. Some bookmakers have stopped taking bets on the Christmas chart outcome. It means the X Factor could be denied the festive top spot for the second time in three years - after Rage Against The Machine beat Joe McElderry to number one in 2009. The show's creator Simon Cowell congratulated Malone and his choir, tweeting: ""Congrats to Little Mix & congrats to Military Wives. It's a great cause & a worthy Christmas No.1."" Other contenders for the official Christmas number one this week include Lou Monte's Dominick The Donkey, two different versions of Last Christmas and Stacey Solomon's rendition of Driving Home For Christmas. Proceeds from the sale of each Military Wives CD will be donated jointly to The Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lloyds accused of 'bad faith' in bank branch sell-off,"Lord Levene, former chair of NBNK Investments - which bid to buy the branches - told the Treasury Committee that Lloyds was ""swayed by political considerations"". Lloyds chose to sell the branches to the Co-operative Bank. But the deal collapsed after a £1.5bn hole was found in the Co-op's finances. Lloyds subsequently hived off the branches to its revived TSB brand, which is expected to float on the stock market next year. Lord Levene said that ""leading market players"" believed at the time the Co-op bid for the branches would fail. He believed both Lloyds and the government had chosen to concentrate on ""all the positive aspects of the Co-op and none of the positive aspects of our bid"". ""I would say that Lloyds were swayed by political considerations. I would say that their assessment of our bid... was not done fairly,"" he added. Lord Levene set up NBNK in order to create a new so-called challenger bank aimed at creating competition among the existing mainstream High Street banks. ""With the benefit of hindsight, there must have been a view that if the creation of a new challenger bank would be created by a mutual, this would be another tick in the box for the goals that had been set out,"" he told the committee. 'Not fair' Lord Levene said it was a ""matter of regret"" that the aim to create a new retail bank after larger institutions had ""lost their way"" had failed. In written evidence submitted to the committee, Lord Levene detailed a NBNK board meeting in January 2012 where concerns were raised that ""it was not a fair race"" and ""that the Co-op was not in any shape at all to undertake the acquisition"". He said the minutes of the meeting also referred to NBNK's belief that the then financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, ""should be concerned about the Co-op"". Lord Levene said he had later been told by then Bank of England's then governor, Sir Mervyn King, that the NBNK bid could not be accepted, and a month later in June 2012 the Co-op was announced as ""preferred and exclusive bidder"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gypsy and traveller sites 'neglected' by councils,"In 2007, there were 31 authorised sites and 34 unauthorised ones - rising to 87 and 32 by July 2017. Trudy Aspinwall, a Gypsy and traveller advocate, said councils failed to do enough until they were forced to. The Welsh Local Government Association said all councils had submitted accommodation assessments for 2015-20. A spokesman said limited capital grant funding from the Welsh Government was available to develop, extend or refurbish sites. Gwynedd, Newport, Pembrokeshire and Powys councils have secured money for 2017/18. Ms Aspinwall, team manager at advocacy group Travelling Ahead, said: ""Most local authorities haven't taken their responsibilities towards Gypsies and travellers very seriously until they had to."" One of the key drivers in the increase was a change in the law - previously, councils had no obligations but the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 placed a duty on them to provide sites if there was a need. As of July, Anglesey, Denbighshire, Ceredigion and Caerphilly had no authorised sites and Caerphilly is the only council not to have had one since 2007. On Anglesey, land has been earmarked for a temporary stopping place and a permanent site. Denbighshire council has launched a search for a six-pitch site and a transit site. Neither Caerphilly nor Ceredigion have plans to create a site, both saying a 2016 survey showed there was no demand. By contrast, Pembrokeshire's authorised sites rose from seven in 2007 to 20 in 2017 and Flintshire's went from three to 10. Ms Aspinwall said one of the delays was ""where local authorities have even tried to provide a small site, there's a very disproportionate responses from non-Gypsy and traveller people to those plans"". 'Vilified' She added that, while people had the right to be consulted, Gypsies and travellers faced ""misunderstanding about who they are and how they live"". ""All too often you see elected members speaking out at anti-Gypsy and traveller meetings, rarely will you see them speaking in support,"" she said. ""Local authorities need to employ the legislation and guidance in a spirit of fairness when Gypsy and traveller needs are given the attention they should have because of long neglect."" She said families were frustrated about the pace of progress, adding creating enough authorised sites would benefit everyone. ""Site provision is really needed because it allows people not to be moved on all the time and can link in with the local communities,"" she said. ""It's more effective to provide a safe and secure managed space they will pay rent for - with council tax and utilities. That is surely better than people constantly being moved on and vilified.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cpl Anne-Marie Ellement 'had discussed threesome' with two colleagues,"Anne-Marie Ellement, from Bournemouth, was stationed in Germany at the time of the alleged attack in 2009. She has since died. Former corporals Thomas Fulton and Jeremy Jones, who are both 28 and have since left the Army, deny rape. The admit they both had sex with Cpl Ellement but claim it was consensual. A panel of civil servants and senior military officers heard Cpl Fulton, Cpl Jones and Cpl Ellement, who was serving with the Royal Military Police at the time, had been drinking heavily with two colleagues - Cpl Joseph Merron and L/Cpl Arron Harris - before the alleged attack. Mr Harris, who has also since left the Army, said he remembered the conversation turning towards ""a serious discussion"" of three-way sex. The court was told he also witnessed Cpl Fulton and Cpl Ellement kissing and touching each other, and saw Cpl Ellement sitting on Cpl Jones' lap while he touched her legs. ""She was making no movement to stop it at all,"" Mr Harris said. Cpl Merron said he also overheard them discussing a threesome and witnessed ""flirting"" between Cpl Fulton and Cpl Ellement. Sarah Noteyoung, Cpl Ellement's friend and Cpl Fulton's then girlfriend, told the court she received a message from Cpl Fulton apologising at 01:33 - shortly after the alleged rape. ""All I can say is I honestly didn't do anything wrong and I'm sorry, I'm going to turn my phone off night! X,"" it read. Miss Noteyoung, who was a corporal in the Army at the time and attending a funeral in England, later replied: ""R u ok? X"" A further message said: ""Tom. I dunt care what ppl are saying or what they think. I want to stay with you. Ive never been so devastated in my life. Thinkin bout you. This funerals so hard without u here. Cu 2Moz 7 x"". Cpl Ellement, who was 28 at the time, was later found nearly naked and crying outside her accommodation by Cpl Charlene Pritchard. ""She was hysterical, she was all over the place,"" she told the court. Cpl Pritchard said she initially believed Cpl Ellement's account of the alleged attack but her opinion changed during a week spent together in Hereford. ""Initially she only mentioned she had sex with one of them and then, it was later that day or the following morning, that she said she had sex with both of them.""

Coronavirus lockdown: English Conservative MP's call to scrap Senedd 'wrong',"Shrewsbury and Atcham MP Daniel Kawczynski said he was fed up of Wales having different rules to England. Unlike in Wales, people in England can drive to ""other destinations"" to exercise from Wednesday. Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams said Mr Kawczynski should not be questioning the ""fundamentals of Welsh democracy"". Calling for for the scrapping of the Senedd, Mr Kawczynski had said the ""current gap emerging"" during the coronavirus crisis resulted in ""the prime minister saying to my constituents you can now go for a walk on the beach, but you are prohibited from going across the frontier to get to our nearest coast"". ""I am sorry but the time has come to reach out as Conservatives to large numbers of like-minded citizens in Wales who like us believe in one system for both nations,"" he said. ""We must work towards another referendum to scrap the Welsh Assembly and return to one political system for both nations - a political union between England and Wales."" The assembly was renamed Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament this month. The comments have already been rejected by Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies. Mr Hart told BBC Radio Wales on Monday the abolition call was ""not a sentiment which has added much value to this really important discussion"". On Twitter, Mr Davies wrote: ""No. This is not our party's policy"". Now, in a letter to Mr Kawczynski, Mr Williams said a number of constituents had raised his ""thought-provoking insight into UK constitutional affairs"". Mr Williams tells his Conservative colleague we should ""respect that the Welsh Government and Welsh Parliament can, and will, exercise their constitutional powers, granted through multiple referendums by the people of Wales"". ""The time for serious debate and inquiry into the effect of this divergence is not for now,"" the Montgomeryshire MP writes. ""It will come later. In the meantime, to question the fundamentals of Welsh democracy because of any divergence is wrong and unhelpful."" Instead, Mr Williams urges him to join efforts to get a Conservative Welsh Government elected at next year's Senedd election. This is ""the only way to ensure better co-ordination through times of crisis"" between ministers in London and Cardiff, he says. Labour has led the Welsh Government since devolution two decades ago, once in coalition with Liberal Democrats, from 2000 to 2003, and also with Plaid Cymru between 2007 and 2011.

EU prepares to move two agencies from London,"By Laurence PeterBBC News, Brussels The relocation must take place by the Brexit deadline - 30 March 2019. Some countries are bidding to host both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA). It means hundreds of jobs moving from London, along with significant revenue from hotel stays and conferences. The deciding vote will take place in November. The EU 27 agreed on the selection process on Thursday night, after UK Prime Minister Theresa May had left the Brussels summit. The 27 are determined that the UK will pay the relocation bill, as Brexit was a UK decision. The EMA's total number of staff in 2015 was 890, while the EBA's was 189. Both are headquartered in Canary Wharf. The EMA had 36,000 visitors in 2015, and 30,000 hotel nights were booked, the European Council said. What do the agencies do? EMA EBA The national rivalry over hosting the agencies will be closely watched. It could reveal some wider tensions over Brexit, so it will be an early test of EU unity in the tough Brexit negotiations. In 2001 Italy's then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi mocked Finland's bid to host the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). ""There is absolutely no comparison between culatello (speciality ham) from Parma and smoked reindeer,"" Mr Berlusconi was quoted as saying. Italy's bid beat Finland's, and the EFSA opened in Parma in 2005. First the European Commission will assess the competing bids and make its recommendations. In November each of the EU foreign ministers will vote in order of preference - three points for the preferred bid, two points for the second-favourite and one point for the third. Accessibility and efficient infrastructure are the top two agreed criteria. But the EU also wants the new hosts to have good ""European-oriented"" schooling and job opportunities for the families of agency staff. Germany's Spiegel news website joked that the voting would be rather like the Eurovision Song Contest. ""That's why the Germans fear equally wretched results,"" Spiegel said - even though Frankfurt, as HQ of the European Central Bank, would be a logical host for the EBA. A flavour of this new EU ""beauty contest"" was provided by Austria. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said his country ""is already a terrific location for many international organisations. ""We have wonderful general conditions in Vienna, and that's why I consider that we are a very attractive location."" The EU is keen to locate some of its agencies in the newer member states of Central and Eastern Europe - it has stated that as an aim. But their rejection of the EU asylum policy - notably refusing to take in refugees currently in Italy and Greece - may count against them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Angelina Jolie gene testing for all?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The Hollywood actress had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed due to the high risk of cancer in her case. Women tend to be offered testing for the corrupted gene if cancer runs in the family. However, the team at Queen Mary University of London says there are added benefits in testing everyone. When women are diagnosed they can be monitored more closely for cancer and many, like Angelina Jolie, have preventive surgery. Breast cancer survival 'unaffected by faulty gene' The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, estimated the impact of screening all 27 million women over 30 in the UK. They said it would: The study also said mass screening would be cost-effective for the health service. Dr Ranjit Manchanda, a consultant gynaecological oncologist and one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It [would] prevent many more cancers and save many more lives. ""But this is the first step in the process. We can't offer it immediately in the general population. We still need to understand how to deliver it."" Challenges include how to test so many people and how to offer genetic counselling to women affected. Faulty gene Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 can impair the body's ability to repair damage to DNA in its cells. This can greatly increase the risk of developing cancers. Royal Marsden Hospital - Beginners Guide to BRCA Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of women's cancer charity The Eve Appeal, said: ""The impact that this study could have on healthcare in the future for these cancers is promising and an exciting step forward in prevention."" Samia al Qadhi, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Care, said the findings were fascinating, but there were still many questions to answer. She said: ""Being tested for a faulty gene is absolutely no walk in the park - preparing for possible life-changing results for a whole family is overwhelming and emotionally draining. ""Support for people tested and for the tough decisions that can follow must be at the heart of any plans for population screening."" The UK's National Screening Committee said it would look at the findings ""with interest"". Follow James on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Smart motorway deaths: Safety assurances 'a big job',"Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood, head of the Transport Committee, has written to the organisation asking for assurances about the actions they've taken to improve their safety. It follows the death of two men who were hit on the M1 near Sheffield. Highways England said smart motorways are ""as safe"" than those with a permanent hard shoulder. The committee is planning to question the authority at a meeting later this month. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Ms Greenwood said: ""We've recently written to Highways England because there are these continued concerns from members of the public and other organisations, such as the AA, that it is simply not safe. ""Highways England has got a big job to convince the public and my committee that people are safe and they know what they need to do when they're using a smart motorway."" Paul Unwin, Highways England smart motorways programme sponsor, has defended the scheme. He said: ""Our smart motorways are as safe, if not much safer, than traditional motorways."" He claimed motorists are already experiencing ""huge safety benefits"" from smart motorways, as the 12 stretches currently in place have seen a 27% reduction in incidents. In June, Jason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, from Mansfield, were driving along a smart motorway section of the M1 near Sheffield when they had a minor collision. When the men stopped to exchanged details, they were hit by an oncoming lorry and killed. Mr Mercer's widow Claire, from Rotherham, is planning to sue Highways England for corporate manslaughter. She said: ""They pulled over into what should have been the hard shoulder and they tried to pull over out of that as well but unfortunately there are barriers and bankings in the way."" Ms Greenwood said there should be more emergency refuge areas for drivers. She added: ""Obviously if there is no hard shoulder, it can be difficult to get away from traffic. ""The previous select committee recommended there should be more emergency refuge areas and they should be 500 to 800 metres apart, as they were in the M42 pilot.""

Employment: North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery,"Hiring has gathered pace since lockdown started to ease, but the growth is unevenly spread, joint research by the Centre of Cities think-tank and jobs site Indeed found. Barnsley and Mansfield have seen the biggest rises in job vacancies, while Aberdeen and Belfast had the lowest. The study analysed vacancies in 63 cities and large towns. It found that in some parts of the country job postings now exceed their pre-pandemic level. Nine cities or towns now have more job vacancies than before the pandemic, led by Barnsley (+21%), Mansfield (20%) and Stoke (17%). Other places where postings have recovered least are led by Aberdeen (-53%), Belfast (-39%) and Crawley (-39%). Towns and cities in south east England figured heavily among places at the bottom of the recovery list. London is among the areas showing the slowest recovery, with job postings in the capital still 26% below their pre-pandemic level. Elena Magrini, senior analyst at the Centre for Cities, said: ""Places reliant on tourism, aviation and office workers have been particularly hard hit and still have high shares of people who are unemployed or on furlough."" Crawley, for example, is home to Gatwick Airport, which has been hard hit by job cuts due to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Ms Magrini added that despite the patchy recovery, there are reasons for optimism. ""Once we have reopened the economy, policy makers need to focus on building back better - growing the economy by creating better paid, higher skilled jobs for people right across the country,"" she said. The improving picture in the North and Midlands was partly driven by the mix of available jobs. Recoveries have been strongest in areas with a greater pre-pandemic share of postings in occupations related to the production and distribution of goods, such as manufacturing, driving and stocking, as well as essential services like healthcare, social care and education. On the other hand, places with a higher share of pre-pandemic job opportunities in food and beverage services and hospitality and tourism are lagging behind. Pawel Adrjan, head of EMEA research at Indeed, said: ""Cities and towns in the North and Midlands have been buoyed by rising manufacturing, distribution, healthcare and education jobs. But at the same time areas reliant on hospitality, tourism and higher paying jobs that can be performed from home have seen only sluggish growth. ""We've seen how quickly the jobs market reacts to policy and public health announcements and policy makers will hope the eventual unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions will help level up the jobs recovery.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chevron and Valero's deal to buy Pembroke oil refinery,"The US-based company said it had reached an agreement with Valero. There are hopes the deal will secure the long-term future of the refinery in Pembroke, which is worth an estimated £1.5m a week to the county's economy. Valero, which will also acquire Chevron's marketing and logistics assets in the UK and Ireland, said it intended to retain all staff. The Chevron plant had been on the market for a year, and Valero said it agreed to pay $730m (£456m) for the refinery and $1b (£625m) for the assets. Chairman and chief operating officer Bill Klesse said: ""The Pembroke refinery remained profitable and cash-flow positive even during the depths of the economic downturn in 2009."" Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said: ""This is fantastic news and will hopefully secure the long term future of the refinery in Pembrokeshire. ""I have spoken to Chevron and was pleased to have assurances for the future of the refinery and its workforce. I will be speaking to Valero shortly and will be highlighting the important role the refinery plays in the regional and national economy."" Pembrokeshire council deputy leader John Allen-Mirehouse said the authority would seek a meeting as soon as possible with Valero. ""We welcome the end to the uncertainty for the employees following today's announcement... it has been a difficult 12 months for all of them,"" he added. ""The Pembroke refinery is crucial to the economy of Pembrokeshire and makes a massive contribution to the Welsh and UK economy as well."" 'Secure stable future' Deputy First Minister and Economy Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said: ""We are now awaiting further details of this bid. I have spoken to Chevron today and have requested a meeting with Valero to discuss their plans and to seek assurances about future employment and investment at the site. ""The energy sector plays a key role, not only in the economy of west Wales but in the country as a whole, so we want to see a secure, stable future for the refinery.‬‪"" The Chevron plant is one of two refineries in Pembrokeshire currently up for sale. The other, Murco's refinery in Milford Haven, employs around 370. Earlier, Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP Simon Hart said he hoped a deal would safeguard jobs at the site. ""There has been some concern that if they were sold they might be down sized and there might be significant job losses,"" he added. ""If this is going to be the first step to on-going refining activity along the lines that's currently undertaken by Chevron at the moment, a number of people who continue to have big concerns will be able to think, perhaps, there is a future here.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hong Kong police hold rally to support officers jailed for assault,"The men were sentenced to two years in jail last week for beating a handcuffed protester during the 2014 pro-democracy demonstrations. The sentence angered many officers, who believe it was unjust and too harsh. About 33,000 people attended Wednesday night's gathering at a police recreation ground, according to police associations which organised the event. Organisers said they would help the jailed officers appeal against their convictions and clear their names, reported RTHK. Many were heard yelling ""Fight for justice"" at the two-hour rally, one of the largest of its kind and a rare sign of police dissent. Shocking incident The seven officers were sentenced to jail last week for assaulting social worker and activist Ken Tsang in 2014. TV cameras had caught the officers removing Mr Tsang from the protest area to a nearby park and kicking and punching him as he lay on the ground. It came at the height of the massive street protests calling for greater political freedom, which shut down central areas of the territory for weeks. The incident shocked Hong Kong, where police are generally well regarded. Mr Tsang was himself found guilty of assaulting and resisting officers on the same evening. In sentencing the policemen, Judge David Dufton noted they had been working under ""immense stress"" but that there was ""no justification"" for their actions. The officers' defence lawyer, as well as some in the police force, have argued that policemen at the time had to endure physical and verbal abuse from protesters. One participant at Wednesday's rally told the South China Morning Post that the event was ""a deep and heartfelt expression of genuine support for our colleagues and their families, who we feel have been unfairly treated and whose actions came out of a time of highly charged political emotion and stress"". Chan Cho Kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Junior Police Officers Association, told Reuters: ""Many people think that the police are professional and should tolerate these deliberate insults. But we have different views, we think that some deliberate insult should not be tolerated, which undermines law and order."" Several police associations plan to lobby the city's government to ban insulting acts against public officers on duty, reported the Post.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Keith Vaz quits as Home Affairs Committee chairman,"It follows newspaper claims he paid for the services of two male sex workers. He said: ""It is in the best interest of the Home Affairs Select Committee that its important work can be conducted without any distractions whatsoever. ""I am genuinely sorry that recent events make it impossible for this to happen if I remain chair. "" At the weekend, the Sunday Mirror published pictures it said showed Mr Vaz with male sex workers in a flat in north London that he owns. Illegal drugs were mentioned during a secretly recorded conversation. Another Labour MP will now be elected to replace him, with Conservative MP Tim Loughton taking over as interim chairman. Speaking after Mr Vaz had informed committee colleagues of his intention to resign, Mr Loughton said a new chairman should be in place in October. He said Mr Vaz had given a ""very frank account of what had happened"" and that the committee had accepted his resignation ""with sadness"". Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has said he would refer the matter to the Commons Standards commissioner and may also report Mr Vaz to police. Married father-of-two Mr Vaz said he was referring the paper's allegations to his solicitor. Keith Vaz biography Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician' In his statement announcing his resignation from the chairman role he has held for nine years, Mr Vaz said: ""The integrity of the select committee system matters to me. Those who hold others to account, must themselves be accountable. ""I am immeasurably proud of the work the Committee has undertaken over the last nine years, and I am privileged to have been the longest serving Chair of this Committee. ""This work has included the publication of 120 reports, hearing evidence from Ministers 113 times, and hearing from a total of 1379 witnesses. I am very pleased that so many Members of the Committee have gone onto high office and Ministerial positions.

Unauthorised Julian Assange autobiography due out,"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News It has been published despite the fact Mr Assange broke off his involvement and tried to cancel the project. According to the publishers, Mr Assange signed a contract on 20 December 2010 with Canongate Books to write a book ""part memoir, part manifesto"". After sitting with a ghost writer for more than 50 hours of taped interviews, he decided he wanted to cancel the contract. ""All memoir is prostitution,"" the publishers say he declared after reading the first draft. They say that the money he had been paid as an advance - understood by the BBC to be a substantial six-figure sum - had already been used to settle outstanding legal bills, meaning the contract still stood. They then decided to publish without Mr Assange's consent and without even informing him exactly of when the book would come out, in case he tried to leak it first. The result is what is described as an ""unauthorised first draft"" of the autobiography. The book - a version of which has been seen by the BBC - recounts his early life growing up in Australia and how he became entranced by computers - and by hacking. In parts of the book, Mr Assange - as far as the book actually represents his views, which he may dispute - says he does not oppose privacy but opposes secrecy by institutions ""to protect themselves against the truth of the evil they have done"" and says that ""disclosure is my business, but we don't deal in gossip"". The book recounts Mr Assange's battles to get Wikileaks up and running and presents what appears to be Mr Assange's version of events in Sweden and which led to allegations of sexual assault and the battle over his extradition. He maintains that the relationship was consensual and that he cannot imagine anything happening to make those involved think it was rape - other than malice, a plan to entrap or him or a misunderstanding, according to the text seen by the BBC. ""I may be a chauvinist pig of some sort, but I am no rapist,"" he says. The book also includes a vitriolic attack on what is called ""the mainstream media"" and in particular the Guardian newspaper with whom Mr Assange worked until a falling out occurred. In the book it is claimed they ""double-crossed"" him.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Blair's ex-adviser to lead employment practices review,"Matthew Taylor, former head of the Labour Policy Unit, will look at job security, pay and workers' rights. In the Daily Telegraph, Chancellor Philip Hammond defended plans to put workers on boards and impose greater pay restraint for senior executives. The measures were ""something that responsible businesses will recognise can be positive for them"", he said. He warned that big businesses were ""angering their consumers"" over excessive pay for bosses and poor workers' rights. 'Keeping pace' Speaking ahead of the Conservative Party conference on Sunday, Mrs May said: ""The UK has one of the strongest labour markets in the world - with record numbers of people in work and an unemployment rate almost half the EU average. ""That's a proud record, but if we are to build a country that works for everyone - not just the privileged few - we need to be certain that employment regulation and practices are keeping pace with the changing world of work."" Mr Taylor has been tasked with looking at whether regulations need to change in order to keep pace with what Downing Street says is a growing number of people registered as self employed, on zero hours contracts or in temporary work. The review will look at security, pay and rights and it will also examine whether there are ways to increase opportunities for carers, people with disabilities and the elderly. Mr Taylor, chief executive of the RSA (Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), said it was ""very encouraging"" that he had been asked to chair the independent review. ""New forms of employment have many advantages for workers and consumers but there are challenges and risks,"" he said. ""We need to approach this issue with an open mind, recognising that within our flexible system of employment the same type of contract can have a diverse range of impacts on the people who use them. ""That the prime minister has chosen to prioritise the interests of the growing army of people working in new ways sends an important message."" He said the review team will travel across the UK to hear how people's experience of work affects their daily lives. Seamus Nevin, head of employment and skills policy at the Institute of Directors, said: ""It is important that the government works to ensure our employment regulations and definitions are flexible so that we protect workers and give them access to training and development, while still enabling innovation and enterprise to prosper.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kent baby deaths inquiry urges families to come forward,"Dr Bill Kirkup is looking at a series of failings at the trust that led to the deaths of up to 15 babies. More families have come forward, but he has asked anyone else with any concerns to contact the inquiry team. ""We will deal with whatever it is that you tell us confidentially and sensitively,"" he said. ""It may be that you don't want to take it any further but that's absolutely fine."" The independent review was announced after a series of failings came to light during the inquest of Harry Richford, who died seven days after being born at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital (QEQM) in Margate in November 2017. Dr Kirkup is being assisted by five experts across the fields of obstetrics, midwifery, neonatal medicine, clinical governance and information management. Helen Gittos, whose baby was born at the QEQM in 2014 but died days later, said: ""I think if they [families] have concerns about what happened to their babies then they should use this as an opportunity to talk to the Kirkup inquiry. ""This is not about blame. This is not about making things harder for NHS staff who we know are working so terribly hard. ""It is about trying to improve things for parents in future and time to make sure that mothers and fathers and babies in east Kent are well looked after and can feel that they're going to go into service which is safe and that they can trust."" Explaining the process, Dr Kirkup said: ""The first step is to find out what happened in each and every case that we're aware of so that we can see where things might have gone wrong. ""Then we'll look at what was the response to something going wrong. Was it investigated properly? Were lessons learned, and then what the trust was doing and what external bodies were doing too?"" Dr Kirkup said this summer a ""significant"" number of families had been in touch regarding concerns over the care they received. People can contact the Kirkup investigation team either via the website or by phone. Dr Kirkup said families could talk to his team without being identified. A spokeswoman for the NHS trust said: ""We welcome the independent investigation and we will do everything we can to help Dr Bill Kirkup and his team.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trolling forces newspaper to end women's Australian rules comments,"The Herald Sun said it had decided to shut off the comments following appeals from players, commentators and fans. One story had received almost 300 comments of a ""sexist tone"", it said. Abusive comments aimed at players have plagued the sport for months. Women began playing Australian rules football professionally in 2017. Last year Prime Minister Scott Morrison referred to online trolls who attacked star footballer Tayla Harris as ""cowardly grubs"". On Thursday, an article in the Herald Sun explained why comments had been removed from articles about women's Australian rules football (AFLW). Herald Sun head of sport Matt Kitchin said: ""The least offensive of the comments runs to the tune of 'get back in the kitchen' and the worst cannot be repeated they are so objectionable. ""Players, commentators, fans and clubs have all appealed to the Herald Sun to shut off the comments. And we've heard them."" The move comes two weeks after Harris, a football player for Carlton, offered to give up her wage in order for the AFL to employ someone to monitor online bullying. ""God damn I'll give up my AFLW wage to employ someone to monitor this, public bullying is a ripple effect to young people in schools and communities that lead to mental health issues and suicide,"" she wrote on Twitter. She called on the sports governing body the AFL to ""be a leader in this space"". ""Ignoring these comments is not a solution. Fight back,"" she urged. Last year Harris was targeted with derogatory comments underneath a picture of her playing for the Carlton Blues posted on social media. The controversy also led to questions about how media companies handle abusive comments after Channel Seven deleted the picture from its website in an effort to combat the trolling. The company reposted the photo after a backlash. A number of Australian sportswomen have supported Harris, including former Olympic cycling champion Anna Meares. Campaigners have also backed her, including Patty Kinnersly, head of Our Watch, which aims to tackle Australia's high rates of violence against women. The AFLW professional league was launched in 2017, drawing sell-out crowds and TV ratings in a country that lives and breathes sport. When the first game was held, 26,000 fans turned up to the game, forcing the gates to close and 2,000 to be locked out. At the time, the Herald Sun wrote: ""Footy's new female formula has a very big future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Co-op sale would be 'bad for competition and choice',"By Guy KiltyBusiness reporter Sir Vince told BBC 5 live a sale would be ""bad news"" for all UK bank customers because of reduced competition. Earlier this week the Co-op Bank's board put it up for sale, four years after a near collapse. The bank was rescued in a deal that left the Co-operative Group with a 20% stake and hedge funds owning the rest. Co-op Bank has four million customers and is well known for its ethical standpoint, which its board said made it ""a strong franchise with significant potential"" to prospective buyers. But the former business secretary and the two MPs told BBC 5 live's Wake up to Money that they disagree, fearing an impact on choice and competition. ""Whatever we think about the Co-op Bank and how it got in to trouble, it's bad news when we have only a very, very small number of banks catering to domestic and business customers,"" Sir Vince said. ""Britain is in a very unusual position of having a very high concentration of banks, quite unlike most continental countries such as Germany, quite unlike the United States, where there are lots of big and small banks catering to different needs."" He said: ""We have a concentrated system, and it's one that has historically provided a very bad service."" Higher charges Treasury Committee member George Kerevan, the SNP MP for East Lothian, said he was ""extremely concerned"". ""My big worry is that one of the big vulture funds will buy it up simply to squeeze out what remaining value there is, and we'll have even less competition with banks on the high street,"" Mr Kerevan said. ""Britain has probably the most monopolised, concentrated banking system in the world. It means there's no competition, which means that charges to the consumer are higher than they need to be,"" he added. Meanwhile, Helen Goodman, Labour MP for Bishop Auckland and who also sits on the Treasury Committee, had particular concern about the sale because ""it's the only ethical bank which is available to large numbers of people"". ""It seems to me that that's an option that many people wish to have,"" Mrs Goodman said. ""So obviously, if the Co-op Bank has to be sold I hope that whoever buys it can make a firm, legally-binding commitment to continue with this ethical stance."" Earlier this week, Co-op Bank chief executive Liam Coleman said the company's strong brand and ""distinct values and ethics"" put it in a strong position. ""In a market where there is little to distinguish many banking brands, we believe this continues to set us apart,"" he said. The Co-operative Group said in a statement it ""supported the plan to find the bank a new home"", adding that its ""goal is to ensure the continued provision of the type of co-operative banking products our members want"".

HIV antibodies 'have potent impact',"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News Potent antibodies were able to wipe a hybrid of human and monkey immunodeficiency viruses from the bloodstream of monkeys within days. The findings could ""revolutionise"" the search for an HIV cure, say experts. The US researchers said trials in patients with HIV now needed to take place. The immune system produces precisely targeted antibodies to take out HIV, but the virus is able to rapidly mutate to evade the immune assault. However, some antibodies have been discovered that target the ""conserved"" parts of HIV - those that the virus struggles to change because they are vital for it to function. 'Undetectable' Two groups, from Harvard Medical School and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, performed the first trials of these antibodies. They used rhesus macaques that had been infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), a blend of HIV and the monkey equivalent. Data from the Harvard team showed that injection of the antibodies drove SHIV from the bloodstream until it reached undetectable levels after three to seven days. The effect lasted for one to three months, but in three monkeys the virus did not return to the blood during the 250-day study. Prof Dan Barouch told the BBC: ""The effect with these potent antibodies is profound and unprecedented. It's probably as large an antiviral therapeutic effect as has ever been seen. ""But we have to make sure we don't overhype and the limitation is the study is in animals, not humans."" The antibodies were also able to attack the virus in some tissues. Drugs can assault the virus in the blood during normal HIV treatment, but the virus can hide in other parts of the body. These early findings raise the prospect of using antibodies to clear these tissues as well. Similar results were produced by the team at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 'Revolutionise' HIV infection is incurable, although taking a daily dose of medication can keep the virus in check, giving patients a near-normal life expectancy. The antibodies will be tested in human clinical trials and if successful they could be used alongside antiretroviral drugs as a treatment. It may also be possible to devise a vaccine that could train the immune system to produce these antibodies. However, both these ideas are dependent on human trials being successful. Commenting on the findings, Prof Louis Picker and Prof Steven Deeks said: ""The findings of these two papers could revolutionise efforts to cure HIV."" However, they warned that HIV was so prone to mutation that it was ""likely that some people will harbour viruses that are resistant to one or more"" of the antibodies.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Australia asylum needs military solution, says Tony Abbott","Opposition leader Tony Abbott said the issue was ""a national emergency"", and he would ask a military commander to tackle the boats, if elected. The migrant boat sank off Indonesia's Java island, a transit point for people-smugglers, on Wednesday. Asylum policy is due to be a key issue in elections this year in Australia. Australia has experienced a spike in asylum seekers arriving by boat this year. ""There is a national emergency on our borders,"" Mr Abbott said on Thursday. ""That's why we need to have a senior military officer in operational control."" Under the plan, called Operation Sovereign Borders, the chief of the defence force would be asked to appoint a commander to lead operations tackling people smugglers and asylum boats. The commander would report directly to the immigration minister, creating ""a clear chain of command"", Mr Abbott said. Boat arrivals have soared in the past 18 months, with most asylum seekers coming from Iraq, Iran, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. They make their way to Indonesia and from there head to Christmas Island, the closest part of Australian territory to Java. They travel in boats that are often over-crowded and poorly-maintained. Several have sunk in recent months, killing passengers. Australian aid row Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who announced a new asylum policy last week, said Mr Abbott's proposal was no more than ""a three-word slogan... Operation Sovereign something-or-other"". Under Mr Rudd's policy, asylum-seekers arriving by boat in Australia will be sent to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for processing, and those whose refugee claims are upheld will be settled in PNG, rather than Australia. PNG will receive Australian investment as part of the deal. However, critics have accused Australia of avoiding responsibility and passing on its problem to a developing nation. Meanwhile, a row has broken out between PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and the Australian opposition. On Tuesday, Mr Abbott described Australian aid to PNG as ""a free gift"", saying ""it seems we are basically just handing over cash to the PNG government"". Opposition foreign affair spokeswoman Julie Bishop also said that Mr O'Neill had told the coalition he had ""total control over the entire Australian aid budget"". On Thursday, Mr O'Neill told Australian broadcaster ABC that he was ""disappointed"" with the opposition. ""I don't particularly appreciate being misrepresented by others for their own political interests,"" he said. Asylum policy is likely to be an important issue in Australia's federal elections, which must take place by 30 November.

App tells if office workers are not socially distanced,"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter Mind The Gap was designed by London start-up Hack Partners for the company, to keep employees safe at work. The technology uses audio and Bluetooth signals to detect if users are in close proximity to one another. Network Rail staff now use the app widely, and it's being rolled out to other companies. ""I am immensely proud of our entire workforce for the part they have played to keep the country running throughout the pandemic,"" Martin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety, technical and engineering director said. ""As we start to plan for a return to office working, we've been looking at absolutely everything to make sure we can continue to keep our people safe."" How it works Employees can choose to download the app and set their desired distance, in line with government guidelines. They will then receive a notification when another user of the app is too close. Mind The Gap uses inaudible ultra-high frequency sounds and Bluetooth to calculate the distance between phones, so it does not require an active internet connection to work. Although many contact-tracing apps have found it hard to accurately detect distances with Bluetooth, Hack Partners says the combination of the technology with audio measuring, gives an accuracy of between 6-8cm. The app will continue to work in the background, which means it could drain phone battery. Tests so far have shown that the high frequency sounds do not affect children, dogs, cats or hearing aids, said River Tamoor Baig, chief executive of Hack Partners. 'Awkward conversation' ""It's very easy to relax back into old patterns with colleagues and forget to distance, so this is a reminder,"" he said.

China's Luckin Coffee slumps on 'fake' data news,"The Chinese coffee chain has now suspended its chief operating officer Jian Liu and staff reporting to him. It comes after the company appointed a special committee to investigate issues in its financial statements for 2019. Luckin, which competes with Starbucks, had been one of China's few successful US stock market listings last year. The Nasdaq-listed company said its investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £250m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales. It also said that it still needed to investigate and verify other costs and expenses that were substantially inflated during the same period. At the same time Luckin warned investors that they should no longer rely on its previous financial statements that had showed the company's rapid growth. The company had 3,680 stores as of the end of September, according to its third quarter 2019 earnings release. That represents an almost six-fold increase since June 2018. Did Luckin's sky-high ambitions cause its current problems? Luckin has been open about wanting to take on the likes of Starbucks and other big coffee chains. The trouble is that, once you make such a declaration, for many that can become the standard you are measured by and have an impact on the buying and selling of shares. For some time, critics have questioned the financial data coming out of Luckin, especially in terms of how much revenue could be raised from the volume of coffee it sells. That's because the proportion of coffee sold at its advertised price is thought to be small. Luckin offers sales discounts so regularly (like pretty much every day) that many customers have claimed on social media that they have never paid full-price for one of their coffees. In one way that doesn't matter. If you're selling your coffee for more than it costs to make it there's profit to be made. However, Luckin has set the bar higher than that by saying it would swamp Starbucks in China and maybe it's this self-applied pressure which has steered it into these rough seas. Luckin's US stock market value had almost tripled since its debut in New York in May, topping $50 a share earlier this year. Mr Liu has been Luckin's chief operating officer since May 2018. In recent months though investors had begun to become wary that there may be some serious issues at the company after an anonymous report alleging that it had made up some of its numbers. Earlier this year the high-profile short-seller Muddy Waters Research started betting against the company's shares, citing a report that alleged that Luckin had fabricated financial and operating figures from the third quarter of last year. At the time, Luckin strongly denied the allegations, describing them as ""misleading and false"". Luckin's shares ended Thursday's trading session down by more than 75% at $6.40 after hitting a record low of $4.90 earlier in the day.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Short-sighted' Borders Railway vision claims denied,"Think-tank Reform Scotland said the route had been left with limited potential for expansion. It said the Edinburgh to Tweedbank line had shown thinking was ""too small"" and planning ""too short-term"". The Scottish government said the railway had proved a huge success and expected more investment in future. Reform Scotland released written evidence it had sent to Transport Scotland's rail infrastructure strategy consultation. It has been submitted on its behalf by advisory board member Tom Harris, a former Labour transport minister in the UK government. He makes a range of suggestions including the need for ""bigger thinking"" in the long-term vision for Scotland's railways. 'Bigger picture' Mr Harris singled out the Borders Railway for criticism with the construction of bridges to accommodate only single-track width as an example of limits placed on future expansion. He said: ""We are in danger of missing the bigger picture when it comes to discussing rail in Scotland. ""We talk in very narrow terms about ScotRail and its operation, but what we actually need is an injection of some creative, strategic thinking so that we can give the Scottish people a rail system built for the future and one to be proud of. "" He called for the creation of a Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to examine what ""ambitious transformational projects and new railway lines"" were needed to boost the Scottish economy and ""transform our connectivity as a nation"". ""The Borders Railway showed us that there is an appetite for new railways in Scotland, but it also showed us that our thinking is too small and our planning too short-term,"" he said. ""That ship has now sailed, but we must learn the lessons from it, think big, and plan long, and that is why the need for a commission is now critical."" 'Different views' A Scottish government spokesman said it welcomed Reform Scotland's comments. ""The think-tank has raised issues about structure and vision,"" he said. ""Whilst there will be different views on structures to realise the vision for Scotland's railways it is clear that the ambitions for our railway to be a driver of economic growth and a positive, integral part of our social fabric is an ambition that is shared right across Scotland."" He said the reopening of the Borders Railway had been a ""cause for celebration"" in the Borders and Midlothian. ""We were always confident that, in time, it would deliver major economic opportunities and attract new investment, so it is pleasing to see strong evidence that visits and spending are up significantly as a direct result of the new railway,"" he said. ""With over 1.2m passenger journeys in its first year alone, additional seats on peak time services and more improvements and initiatives in the pipeline, we look forward to seeing even more investment and interest in the area in the months and years ahead.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Armenia 'ready' for ceasefire talks,"Casualties have mounted in the southern Caucasus with both sides accusing each other of launching deadly attacks. The conflict around the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh erupted on Sunday. The enclave is officially part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. The two former Soviet republics went to war over the territory between 1988 and 1994, eventually declaring a ceasefire, and they have never reached a settlement over the dispute. France, Russia and the US, which co-chair the OSCE Minsk mediation group, have called for a ceasefire, but so far Azerbaijan has not given a positive response to proposed talks. In the latest fighting, Azerbaijan forces said they had made further advances, but accused Armenia of artillery attacks on four villages, causing civilian casualties. Armenia says it has shot down seven drones flying near the capital, Yerevan, but the claim has been rejected by Azerbaijan. What hope of a ceasefire? In a joint statement on Thursday, the presidents of France, Russia and the US called for an ""immediate cessation of hostilities between the relevant military forces"". Armenia's foreign ministry responded on Friday, saying it was ready to engage with the three OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs ""to re-establish a ceasefire regime based on the 1994-1995 agreements"". Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev has so far rejected talks, and his main ally, Turkey, has said a lasting ceasefire depends on ""Armenians' withdrawal from every span of Azerbaijani territory"". At the scene By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Nagorno-Karabakh Here in the regional capital Stepanakert, all eyes are on the skies, looking for any sign of the Azerbaijani military drones that have been such a feature of this first week of hostilities. Nowhere feels safe in Nagorno-Karabakh. It's about 30km (19 miles) from Azerbaijani positions to Stepanakert, and drones have struck here several times in the last few days. The drones also appear to be identifying targets here for artillery fire. At regular intervals today we heard the sound of missiles landing. At lunchtime the explosions were louder. A rocket had come down just in front of a government building on the outskirts of town. When we arrived, the soldiers were pulling pieces of what they said was an Israeli-built rocket out of the tarmac. All the windows of the nearby buildings had been blown out. Several people had been injured but fortunately no-one killed. Unsurprisingly, many have chosen to leave Stepanakert. We're told lots of the men have gone to the frontline while families have been sent in the other direction towards the Armenian capital Yerevan. Nagorno-Karabakh - key facts",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Voting referendum question 'too hard', says watchdog","Some people - ""particularly those with lower levels of education or literacy, found the question hard work and did not understand it"" - its report says. The watchdog says the structure, length and the language used made the question ""harder to read than it needed to be"". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised to assess the recommendations. The final wording of the question is a matter for the UK Parliament. The question proposed by the government is: Do you want the United Kingdom to adopt the 'alternative vote' system instead of the current 'first past the post' system for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons? The Electoral Commission's suggested redraft is: At present, the UK uses the 'first past the post' system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. Should the 'alternative vote' system be used instead? The referendum, part of the coalition agreement between the Conservatives and Lib Dems, is due to take place on 5 May next year. Under the alternative vote (AV) system, voters rank candidates in their constituency in order of preference. Anyone getting more than 50% of first-preference votes is elected. If no-one gets 50% of votes the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their backers' second choices allocated to those remaining. This process continues until one candidate has at least 50% of all votes cast. The Liberal Democrats back a change to AV, but the Conservatives oppose it, and the two coalition parties have agreed that each will campaign for their own preferred system in the run-up to the referendum. 'Slight change' New Labour leader Ed Miliband says he will be backing a change to AV in the referendum. Jenny Watson, Electoral Commission chairwoman, said: ""People told us that the wording of the question - with some changes - was easy to understand. However, they have a limited knowledge of what the 'first past the post' system is and almost no understanding of the 'alternative vote' system. ""Our research took place without the campaigns and extensive media coverage that will be in place in the run-up to the referendum. We found that when participants had more information on how both systems worked, their understanding improved and they could cast their vote in the way they intended. ""Campaign groups and the media will play an important role in the run-up to the referendum. And the Electoral Commission will also be playing its part, by providing every household in the UK with information on both voting systems and how they can cast their vote."" Mr Clegg, who is overseeing the government's constitutional reform programme, said: ""They have suggested in their report a slight change to the question we proposed and we will look at it. It's only just come out. ""It's quite right that the Electoral Commission should have tested the question. That's why we provided them with our own thoughts on the question and we will look at their recommendations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The battle for nesting sites among the birds and the bees,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Research suggest animals that build their nests in early spring may win the fight for available habitat at the expense of late breeders. Conservation efforts should focus on ensuring rare species have enough places to nest, say scientists. For example, areas could be left to grow wild between spring and summer to help bumblebees establish nests. Habitats such as hedgerows and hay meadows are being lost in many countries, meaning that fewer nesting sites are available. Competition among animals for a suitable place to nest could explain why some species are struggling to survive. ""Ecologists understand why some groups of species are declining more, such as why farmland species are declining more than woodland species,"" said Dr Andrew Higginson of the University of Exeter. ""But an enduring mystery is the big variation in the declines of closely related species. Fighting over nest sites may be part of the reason - when nest sites are hard to come by, the species that will suffer most are those that nest later in the year."" The University of Exeter study analysed population changes in more than 200 bird species and 40 bumblebee species around the world. The population data was combined with a mathematical model that used game theory to predict the likely behaviour of bees and birds when faced with competition for nesting sites. It calculated the implications of fighting for nesting sites, based on the size of each species, the time of nesting and the quality of the nesting site. The study found larger species that nest early generally do better, while smaller bees and birds that nest later in the year lose out in the struggle for habitat. For example, the chaffinch is doing well in the UK, while the goldfinch is on the decline. ""We need to have a more holistic approach to providing good habitat for animals,"" Dr Higginson told BBC News. ""We need to worry about the whole life cycle not just what they eat."" He said conservation efforts for animals such as birds and bees tend to focus on providing food. Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority, he said. This could be as simple as waiting to cut hedgerows until later in the year when all animals have nested or providing more boxes for birds to nest in. The research is published in the journal, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. Follow Helen on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Glasgow to host 2013 Monte Carlo Classic Rally,"Organisers of the Monte Carlo Classic Rally have confirmed Glasgow as a host city for 2013, along with Barcelona, Reims and Copenhagen. About 100 classic cars will be on display in the city on 26 January before they set off from the People's Palace, at Glasgow Green. The cars will pass through Kilmarnock and Dumfries before heading to Monte Carlo via Dover. More than 9,000 spectators saw the centenary rally in 2011 at Glasgow's Blythswood Square - an event which is estimated to have generated £1m for the city's economy. Glasgow previously served as a starting venue for racers from 1949 until 1973. Up to 12,000 people are expected at the new rally start point at the People's Palace in 2013. 'Overwhelming response' The drivers will travel 2,000km from the city to Monte Carlo in Monaco - a journey expected to take about two days. In the morning, before the main event, 50 classic cars, such as Porsches and Lancias, from the 1920 to 1980 era, will be on display in the city's Buchanan Street. Speaking at the launch conference, Douglas Anderson, spokesman for the rally organising committee said: ""The Monte Carlo rally start was a huge part of Glasgow life in the 50s and 60s and many of us remember watching the cars leaving Blythswood Square. ""In those days, you would get a few thousand spectators. When we brought the rally back, after a 38 year absence, in 2011, the response was overwhelming and we started looking at a venue to accommodate more spectators. ""We believe the venue change and the other side-shows could mean it will attract the biggest crowd of any UK start since the rally's birth in 1911."" Crews from Australia, the Czech Republic, Malta and France will join the UK starters in Glasgow. They will cross the Channel at Dover then drive to Valence for the start of the famous concentration runs in the Alps before emerging at Monte Carlo. Around 40 cars leaving from Glasgow will attempt to go all the way, with a further 60 classic cars from all eras joining them over the start ramp in additional support events. Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: ""The Monte Carlo Rally is one of the most famous motor sport events in the world and one which Glasgow has enjoyed a long and illustrious connection with. 'Spiritual home' ""As a city famous for hosting the start of the rally in the 1950s and 60s, I'm delighted that it will once again return to its spiritual home in 2013. ""This extremely colourful and exciting event will not only attract hundreds of visitors, including teams from all over the world, but will generate significant benefits for Glasgow's economy."" The rally was created by Prince Albert I of Monaco and initially featured 23 cars starting from six different European cities. Only 16 completed it in 1911, with Henri Rougier winning in a Turcat-Mery. Related Internet Links RSAC Motorsport Automobile Club de Monaco",Human,English,BBC,,,1
David Cameron: UK must defend Christian values against terror,"The prime minister said responsibility, hard work and compassion were important to people ""of every faith and none"". The ideology behind attacks such as Brussels could be defeated by ""standing up proudly"" for those values, he added. The Archbishop of Canterbury used his Easter sermon to urge people not to give in to fear after the attacks. The prime minister has faced criticism in the past from secularists and some other public figures for describing Britain as a Christian country. He has previously described himself as a ""committed"" but only ""vaguely practising"" Christian, who is ""full of doubts"" on big theological questions. 'Never be cowed' The prime minister said Britain should be proud of being a ""Christian country with Christian values"". ""But they are also values that speak to everyone in Britain - to people of every faith and none,"" he continued. ""And we must all stand together and defend them."" He added: ""When terrorists try to destroy our way of life as they have tried to do again so despicably in Brussels this week - we must stand together and show that we will never be cowed by terror. ""We must show that in this struggle of our generation we will defeat the pernicious ideology that is the root cause of this terrorism by standing up proudly for our values and our way of life."" Mr Cameron also praised the work done by faith and voluntary organisations - helping the homeless, caring for the sick and bereaved and risking their lives to help people in war-torn regions across the world. In his sermon, the Most Rev Justin Welby told worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral that events in Brussels may naturally prompt us ""to act fearfully, to see a world in which fear triumphs"". But he said: ""Easter proclaims to us in flesh and blood that fear and death and terror are not the last words."" Pope Francis, too, has preached an Easter message of hope, calling on Christians not to let fear and pessimism ""imprison"" them. Speaking amid tight security at the Vatican on Saturday night, the Pope said: ""Let us not allow darkness and fear to distract us and control our hearts."" On Good Friday, he denounced ""terrorist acts committed by followers of some religions which profane the name of God and which use the holy name to justify their unprecedented violence"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Tributes to 'white collar' boxer Lance Ferguson-Prayogg,"Lance Ferguson-Prayogg, from Liverpool, died in hospital after paramedics were called to the Forum club on Saturday afternoon. The gym, in Wallasey, Wirral, in which Mr Ferguson-Prayogg trained, tweeted: ""R.I.P. to one of our finest boxers... we are all totally devastated."" Staff at the Forum said they were saddened by the news. Shaun White, from Sheffield, was Mr Ferguson-Prayogg's opponent on Saturday. Mr White told reporters that following the fight Mr Ferguson-Prayogg left the ring and then collapsed. A spokeswoman from East Midlands Ambulance Service said it received a call at about 17:24 BST on Saturday, reporting ""a male who had lost consciousness"". However, it is unclear how Mr Ferguson-Prayogg died. Lance Ferguson-Prayogg trained at 12 Quays Gym in Wallasey and the event was organised by a promoter called Dukeries Fightcard. The show was abandoned after Mr Ferguson-Prayogg collapsed. Damian Hucker from Dukeries Fightcard told the Nottingham Post: ""I am truly devastated by his death and will never be involved in boxing again. ""I was already planning on leaving the boxing scene as I'm about to start training as a paramedic but this has confirmed that for me now."" 'Needs more safety' Mr Ferguson-Prayogg's trainer Micky Allen, who confirmed the boxer had a partner and daughter, said he was grateful for the support he has had from well-wishers on Facebook. He said: ""I just want to thank every single person... Letting you all know that I'm ok, just worried more on Lance's family, partner and child. ""I keep thinking of all the fights we attended and was successful [in]. Skitting at each other and the 12 quays gang."" Marcellus Baz, from the Nottingham School of Boxing, described the bout Ferguson-Prayogg took part in as ""white collar boxing"". He said: ""It's not a governed sport... it's got to be governed, it's got to have more safety. ""England boxing is governed, it's monitored, the safety is right up there where young people are checked before [and after] they go into the ring."" Nottinghamshire Police, the Health and Safety Executive and Nottingham City Council all said they are not investigating the death. The council said in a statement: ""The premises were licensed for boxing and wrestling and it is now a matter for the coroner."" Matt Slater, from BBC Sport Online, said white collar boxing covered a broad spectrum of boxing. He said: ""[White collar boxing] used to be quite a specific thing, but it has become a very generic catch-all phrase for something much larger. ""It's become everything between professional boxing at the very top and amateur boxing at the bottom, there's a huge space in the middle that's been around for ever and ever."" Kirsty Radcliffe, a photographer who had met Mr Ferguson-Prayogg during events, said: ""He was a very well liked man, a very talented boxer, a gent.""

Children 'hid in attic' during Raoul Moat shootings,"Lesley Stobbart told Newcastle Crown Court she fled with the youngsters when Moat, 37, shot at her daughter Samantha and killed her boyfriend Chris Brown. Moat went on to shoot and blind Pc David Rathband last July. Mrs Stobbart was giving evidence at the trial of two men accused of helping Moat, who later shot himself. Karl Ness, 26, of of Brookside in Dudley, North Tyneside, denies the murder of Mr Brown, attempting to murder Pc Rathband, one charge of conspiracy to murder, one charge of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and one of robbing a shop. Qhuram Awan, 23, of Rowley Street in Blyth, Northumberland, denies the attempted murder of Pc Rathband, one charge of conspiracy to murder, one charge of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and one of robbing a shop. Mrs Stobbart said she was at the house in Gateshead when Moat, armed with a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun, began shooting. She watched from an attic window as Moat gunned down karate instructor Chris Brown, 29, then turned the weapon her 22-year-old daughter, leaving her critically injured. It was not until the former doorman ran from the murder scene that Mrs Stobbart realised her daughter had been hurt. Moat, who had been in a six-year relationship with Samantha Stobbart and was released from Durham Prison two days before the shootings. Mrs Stobbart told the court: ""I ran upstairs to get the children. I put them in the attic and I told them not to come out no matter what they did. ""I could see Chris lying on the grass. Then Raoul shot him again. ""I did not know Samantha had been shot at the time. I went down to see where everyone was and she was lying on the floor."" Under cross-examination earlier, Samantha Stobbart said she had been terrified Moat would ""flip his lid"" when he was released from prison. She had said her new boyfriend was a police officer in an attempt to ward off trouble. On the night of the murder, she said she had urged Mr Brown to spend the night at his own flat, knowing Moat was seeking a confrontation. But Mr Brown opted to remain at the house in Gateshead. She said she told Moat their relationship was over, but that he ""would not take no for an answer"". The trial continues. Related Internet Links HM Courts Service",Human,English,BBC,,,1
January Tube strike talks end with 'no progress',"The RMT and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) unions met Tube bosses at conciliation service Acas earlier. But the talks were adjourned ""without any significant moves towards a resolution"", according to the RMT. The dispute centres around ticket office closures. Transport for London (TfL) warned that the majority of central London Tube stations could be closed if the planned 24-hour strike goes ahead on Sunday. It said there would be a severely reduced service across the network from 18:00 GMT if the walkout goes ahead. 'Need more staff' The parties are due to meet again on Friday for further discussions, but both unions said plans for industrial action remained in place. RMT leader Mick Cash said he expected London Underground to ""come back with a radically improved package that fully covers the issues of jobs and safety at the heart of this dispute."" Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, said: ""Our negotiating team remains available for further talks throughout the weekend should they become necessary"". TfL said it was committed to addressing recommendations in a recent report by London Travelwatch into the closure of ticket offices and has started working with the unions to review staffing and restore station roles where needed. Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: ""It is clear that some more staff for stations are needed. We have started to recruit them and will continue to work with the unions to implement the recommendations made in the review."" TfL said it expected services to be severely reduced on Monday and that there would be no Underground services from stations such as Victoria, King's Cross, Waterloo, Paddington, Euston, Bank and London Bridge. Piccadilly line services are expected to still run between Hammersmith and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3, but not to Terminals 4 or 5. There would be no service at all on the Victoria or Waterloo & City lines, and all other lines were expected to be severely affected with limited services in outer London. Buses, roads and rail services including the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) are also expected to be much busier than usual. TfL said it would be deploying Travel Ambassadors in order to help customers get around the city, along with 100 extra buses and ""enhanced"" river services.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Charity warns officer cuts leave prison system 'in crisis',"The charity claims the number of prison officers has been cut by 41% during the Government's time in office. Howard League chief executive Frances Crook said: ""These are desperate times and ministers are resorting to desperate measures."" But the Ministry of Justice disputed the figures, saying the reduction in officer numbers was actually 27%. Analysis of official figures showed there were 14,170 officer-grade staff in state-run prisons at the end of June 2014 while there had been more than 24,000 at the end of August 2010, the charity said. The cuts include 1,375 officer posts lost with the closure of 15 public-sector prisons. A Ministry of Justice source said the Howard League was not comparing like with like and that the period had seen a fall in prison officers from 24,580 to 17,971. 'Matters made worse' Ms Crook said: ""The prison system is in crisis, and these figures reveal why. ""While the prison population has grown, officer numbers have been cut without any thought for the consequences. ""A shortage of governors makes matters even worse, because officers are being taken off the wings and asked to 'act up' to fill vacancies. ""Having made prison officers redundant, the Ministry of Justice is now apparently struggling to recruit. These are desperate times, and ministers are resorting to desperate measures."" She said the only solution to the crisis was to have a ""hard look at who we send to prison and why"" and reduce the prison population. Prison Governors Association president Eoin McLennan-Murray also warned last week that prisons were facing a ""tipping point"" with staff who are ""worn down, tired, over-worked"". 'Risking public safety' Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ""Ministers have caused this crisis by closing down too many prisons too fast and cutting staff while the number of prisoners has gone up. ""Less and less is being done to rehabilitate offenders - so unreformed prisoners will be released from jail risking public safety and creating more victims."" But Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: ""It's beyond me why the Howard League go out of their way to deliberately mislead the public on the state of our prisons. ""They are less overcrowded than they have been for a decade and they are well-run, due to the dedication of the hard-working staff in them. Consistently trying to claim otherwise helps no one.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'CNN wrestling' tweet came from extreme Reddit user,"By Alex DackevychBBC Trending On Sunday, President Trump tweeted a short video showing himself wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head. It's an altered version of a famous World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) appearance by Trump from 2007 - where he took on wrestling royalty Vince McMahon. Donald Trump posts video 'beating' CNN Why CNN 'assault' tweet should surprise no-one It's not known exactly how Trump found the video, but it was posted Wednesday on a section of Reddit (or ""subreddit"") called r/The_Donald. It has more than 440,000 subscribers and describes itself as ""a forum for serious supporters of President Trump"", and ""not politically correct"". It's also been associated with the alt-right - a disparate group of conservatives opposed to political correctness and which includes strains of white nationalism. The creator of the video goes by a crude username we can't repeat in good taste - so we'll just remove the expletive in the middle, and call him ""HanSolo"". In previous posts he described himself as being 37 years old and from Tennessee. He has posted a huge number of messages with anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-black slurs, including posts encouraging violence. More on this story Trump’s shock troops: Who are the ‘alt-right’? America's extremist battle: antifa v alt-right BBC Trending on Facebook For example, Trending found a thread from 8 May where HanSolo repeatedly uses a racial slur during a heated exchange with a black man on another subreddit. It's one of many posts which feature such slurs. In another, HanSolo posted a meme showing CNN employees, each with a Star of David next to their head. In a number of posts, HanSolo also called for the mass murder of Muslims - in some cases encouraging or celebrating attacks using vehicles, guns or nuclear bombs. When the person behind the account found out that the president had shared his meme, he told his fellow Redditors he was ""honored"": But HanSolo also apparently tried to scrub the most potentially offensive messages after the tweet became breaking news - many of his posts were altered or taken down soon after. Some The_Donald subscribers were enthused by Trump's use of a Reddit meme - and speculated that he may be checking out the group himself. It's not the first time that alt-right memes have surfaced on Trump's Twitter account. In July 2016, during the US presidential campaign, Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton superimposed on a pile of money and a Star of David with the words ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"". The picture was traced to an extreme message board. Blog by Alex Dackevych You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hillsborough memorials unveiled in Liverpool,"A memorial monument was unveiled on Old Haymarket in a public ceremony, attended by 300 people, on the eve of the disaster's 24th anniversary. A memorial clock was installed at Liverpool Town Hall in a private ceremony earlier for victims' families. However, campaigners have complained they still face ""bigotry"" from people blaming fans for the disaster. The 96 fans died as a result of a crush within the Leppings Lane terrace of Sheffield Wednesday's stadium during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said a misinformed minority of people still believed Liverpool supporters caused the tragedy, even though the Hillsborough Independent Panel said police and other agencies were at fault for the disaster and subsequent cover-up. 'Facts are lost' ""The bigotry is still there,"" she said. ""I saw David Mellor (former Conservative sports minister) on television the other day protecting Margaret Thatcher in relation to Hillsborough, and he spoke in the context of drunken, violent supporters. ""People still fall back on the bigotry and they will. Sometimes facts are lost if the myths make better press."" Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said the event was extra special, as it was the first since the families of victims fought and won justice in their campaign. Mr Anderson said: ""Twenty-four years, the passage of time has still not dulled the pain and suffering for those of you gathered here today."" He added that the 96 were ""robbed of their dignity by the people in authority"" who indulged in ""lies and deceit"" rather than admit their mistakes. 'Fans' celebration' Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son James in the disaster and is chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Monday's anniversary would be ""an emotional day"". She added: ""I think it should also be a bit of a celebration for the fans and survivors there that day, because they went through so much and it's the first time in all these years that we have had the truth out."" The memorial monument - a 7ft (2.1m) bronze structure - features the words ""Hillsborough Disaster - we will remember them"", along with the names of all 96 Liverpool FC supporters who died. Family members of those who died were the first to be allowed to view it and some touched the individual name of their loved one. The ornate mahogany clock, which is from National Museums Liverpool's collections, was made in the 1780s by John Clifton, and stands 8ft (2.4m) tall. The hands on its 13-inch (33cm) arch dial, which features the sun and moon rising, will be frozen at 15:06 BST, the time at which the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was stopped on 15 April, 1989. The anniversary is also being marked with an exhibition of a 96-tile mosaic called United for Justice, showing an image of a young Liverpool fan shaking hands with a young Everton fan.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Donald Trump hails South Korea trade deal,"It marks the first such agreement finalised by the US president, who has promised to overhaul his country's trade relationships. At a press conference in New York, Mr Trump called the updates to the 2012 agreement ""a very big deal"". The White House first announced the outline of the changes in March. Most analysts said the revisions were relatively modest. The completion of the pact came as Mr Trump faced a number of political controversies, including the sexual harassment allegations against his nominee to the Supreme Court. Businesses are also worried about the impact of retaliatory tariffs to those Mr Trump's administration has imposed on steel and aluminium imports and Chinese goods. Mr Trump said the signing, which took place on the sidelines of the United Nation's General Assembly, was ""a great day"" for the US and South Korea. He described the revised pact as a ""brand new agreement"" and a sign that his trade strategy was working. ""In addition to this deal, we have many in the works, and they are fair deals,"" he said. South Korean President Moon Jae-In focused his remarks on denuclearisation talks with North Korea, in which the US has been involved. He said the new trade agreement, which still needs approval by South Korea's parliament, was a sign of the strong partnership between the US and South Korea. Details of the deal The US started negotiations with South Korea last year, following Mr Trump's criticism of the 2012 deal as a ""one-way street"". Under the new terms, South Korea has agreed to exempt up to 50,000 cars per US manufacturer per year from South Korean safety requirements - double the current number and far higher than any American company currently exports. The country has also agreed to changes such as improvements to its customs procedures and amendments to its drug pricing policies. The agreement also extends a 25% US tariff against South Korean trucks to 2041. It had been scheduled to expire in 2021. Separately, the US agreed to exempt a certain amount of South Korean steel from the 25% tariffs Mr Trump announced in March - equivalent to 70% of the country's average imports from 2015-2017. South Korea and the US are major trade partners, exchanging nearly $155bn in goods and services in 2017.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad's Nazi ties 'went deeper',"Author Elisabeth Asbrink says Mr Kamprad was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War II. The details go beyond what Mr Kamprad has previously admitted. The Swedish billionaire has said his involvement was youthful ""stupidity"", and the ""greatest mistake"" of his life. In her book, Ms Asbrink says Mr Kamprad actively recruited people to the fascist Sweden's Socialist Union (SSS). She says the activity prompted security police to set up a file on him in 1943 when he was 17 - the same year that he founded Ikea. Ms Asbrink says the security police intercepted his post, and noted that he ""had some sort of functionary position"" in a youth Nazi organization. The intelligence services have refused to comment. 'Proud of links' The tycoon revealed some elements of his past in a book in 1988, admitting that he was a close friend of the Swedish fascist activist Per Engdahl, and a member of his New Swedish Movement between 1942 and 1945. Ms Asbrink's book includes details of a wedding invitation Mr Kamprad sent to Engdahl in 1950, telling him how proud he was that the two belonged to the same circle. She says that, in an interview in 2010, he told her that: ""Per Engdahl is a great man, and I will maintain that as long as I live."" A Swedish expert on far-right extremism, Anna-Lena Lodenius, told Radio Sweden that Mr Kamprad's Nazi involvement could no longer be dismissed as the by-product of an accidental friendship with Per Engdahl. His involvement in another fascist organisation, she said, showed he must have been ""perfectly aware"" of what it stood for. However, a spokesman for Mr Kamprad said he had long admitted flirting with fascism, but that now, ""there are no Nazi-sympathising thoughts in Ingvar's head whatsoever"". Although Mr Kamprad ranks 162nd in the most recent Forbes magazine wealth list, worth an estimated $6bn (£3.6bn), some analysts believe he is much richer. Ownership of Ikea, the world's largest furniture chain, is now in the hands of a Dutch charitable foundation created by Mr Kamprad. But some, including the Swedish business newspaper Veckans Affarer, believe that behind complicated legal arrangements, it is still effectively his company. Even so, Mr Kamprad is renowned for a devotion to frugality, reportedly driving an old Volvo and travelling by economy class.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Global executions fall to lowest level in a decade, Amnesty says","Some 690 people were executed in 20 countries last year, excluding China, a fall of 31% on 2017 - when 993 deaths were recorded. Executions in Iran fell by 50% after capital punishment was abolished for some drug offences, Amnesty found. Amnesty says thousands were probably killed in China but records are secret. That would make it by far the leading executioner. The next four nations are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Iraq. They account for about 77% of the 690. What does Amnesty's report say? Amnesty's review of the use of the death penalty, which was released on Wednesday, says that while the number of executions have fallen in some countries, several others have seen a rise, including the US, Japan, Singapore, South Sudan and Belarus. ""The dramatic global fall in executions proves that even the most unlikely countries are starting to change their ways and realise the death penalty is not the answer,"" Amnesty's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, said. ""This is a hopeful indication that it's only a matter of time before this cruel punishment is consigned to history, where it belongs."" Iran, which executes hundreds of people every year, mostly for drug offences, softened its drug crime laws in 2018. The move, which was applied retroactively, affected some 5,000 prisoners awaiting execution. At the end of last year, a total of 106 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes. The countries that saw significant falls in reported executions between 2017 and 2018 are: Have any countries reinstated the death penalty? Yes. Last year Thailand carried out its first execution since 2009, Amnesty found, while earlier this year Sri Lanka began a search for executioners as part of a crackdown on drug smuggling. Capital punishment is legal in Sri Lanka, where nearly 1,300 people are currently on death row, but no executions have taken place in the country since 1976. ""These countries now form a dwindling minority,"" Mr Naidoo said, adding: ""To all the countries that still resort to the death penalty, I challenge you to act boldly and put a stop to this abhorrent punishment now.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bank of Mum and Dad 'feels the pinch',"The average parental contribution for home buyers this year will be £18,000, down 17% from last year's £21,600, according to Legal & General (L&G). The drop shows that parents are ""feeling the pinch"", the firm says. Nonetheless, more than one in four buyers are still expected to receive financial help from friends or family. In total, financial services firm L&G said 27% of home buyers would get assistance - up from 25% last year. Despite the smaller sums being loaned, L&G said the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad was still ""a prime mover"" in the UK housing market. 'My parents had put aside money to gift me' Francesca Hunt, from London, was given between £20,000 and £30,000 (she does not want to say the exact amount) by her parents last year to help her buy a house. She had enough money by herself for a deposit on a one-bed flat, but her parents thought a two-bedroom flat was a better investment. ""My parents decided that the price difference from a one to a two bed isn't, in the grand scheme of things, too much more,"" she says. Francesca said her parents had already put aside money to gift her at some point. ""If not, I would have inherited the money anyway. Better to use it now to get on the property ladder before prices go up even further,"" she says. The money her parents provided was ""gifted"" and Francesca says they don't own any of her flat as a result of their investment. L&G said almost 317,000 housing transactions this year would rely on at least some parental help. However, overall lending was expected to drop to £5.7bn this year from £6.5bn in 2017. Where buyers live also has a big impact on how much they rely on their parents for help. In London, the average parental contribution is £31,000 compared with £11,000 in Scotland. Bank of Mum and Dad in numbers ""People are feeling a bit of a pinch around the economy and therefore we're seeing pretty much a national trend outside of London for less to be given,"" L&G chief executive Nigel Wilson told the BBC. ""The volume of transactions depending on Bank of Mum and Dad funding keeps on growing, even as parents find it harder to provide as much money for the deposit."" He said it was not ""sustainable or fair"" for parents and young people to ""remain so co-dependent when it comes to housing purchases"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Niels Högel: German ex-nurse convicted of killing 85 patients,"Judge Sebastian Buehrmann described Niels Högel's killing spree as ""incomprehensible"". Högel, who is already serving life for two murders, administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005. He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history. Prosecutors said he attacked patients in order to impress colleagues by subsequently trying to revive them. A former colleague told the German newspaper Bild that Högel was nicknamed ""Resuscitation Rambo"" because of the way he ""pushed everyone else aside"" when patients needed to be resuscitated. On the last day of his trial, Högel, 42, asked the families of his victims for forgiveness for his ""horrible acts"". ""I would like to sincerely apologise for everything I did to you over the course of years,"" he said. Högel had been accused of murdering 100 patients in the northern cities of Delmenhorst and Oldenburg. Police believe he may have killed far more but the cremation of bodies had destroyed any possible evidence. Högel had confessed to 55 murders and the court in Oldenburg convicted him of 85, German media reported. Delivering sentence, Judge Buehrmann expressed regret that the court had not been able to ""lift the fog"" for many grieving relatives. The BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin says the case has shocked Germany - not least because senior staff at the two hospitals are accused of having turned a blind eye to unusually high mortality rates. Högel's killing spree was stopped when he was caught in the act of administering unprescribed medication to a patient in 2005 in Delmenhorst. He was sentenced to seven years for attempted murder in 2008, but the families of his other suspected victims pressed for a further investigation. At a second trial that ended in 2015 he was jailed for life for two murders and two attempted murders. However, during that trial he confessed to a psychiatrist that he had killed up to 30 people. Investigators then widened the investigation, exhuming 130 former patients and looking for evidence of medication that could have triggered cardiac arrest. They also pored over records in the hospitals he worked at. Records at the Oldenburg hospital showed rates of deaths and resuscitations had more than doubled when Högel was on shift, German media said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australia climate change: Thousands rally in Sydney amid bushfires,"It came a day after a thick haze caused chaos in the harbour city, setting off smoke alarms and marring visibility. Protesters, many wearing face masks, accused the government of inaction. But Australia's government has defended its policies and argued that climate change is not solely to blame. ""Certainly climate change is a factor, there is no question, but also it is important to note that most of these fires have been caused by 'Little Lucifers',"" Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told ABC, referring to arsonists. What happened at the protest? Organisers estimated that some 20,000 people joined Wednesday's protest march. They accused successive governments of failing to address the ""approaching climate emergency"". ""Now the result is here: unprecedented drought, bushfires, and now a massive health crisis, with millions choking, with no escape, and severe consequences for people's immediate and long term health,"" they wrote on a Facebook page for the event. Protesters held up signs and chanted as they gathered outside Sydney's Town Hall. ""They [the government] are to blame for our largest city being poisoned and rather than taking meaningful action, they are fast-tracking new coal mines,"" Chloe Rafferty, an organiser for the Uni Students for Climate Change group holding the march, told Reuters news agency. ""We are here because we care about the future of our children and their children's children. We are going to send a message to our leaders in our country: that we are now going to stand up to say we are here and we have had enough,"" another protester said. What is the background? Bushfires have been raging for weeks in Australia, killing six people, destroying more than 700 homes and burning millions of acres of land. The blazes have brought ""hazardous"" air quality levels to Sydney. The haze on Tuesday was described by many people as the thickest to blanket the city amid this year's fire crisis. Some residents reported breathing problems and said they were ""choking"" on the smoke. Sydney residents are also facing the city's toughest water restrictions in more than a decade amid a severe drought. What is Australia doing about climate change? Australia has one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions rates in the world due largely to its reliance on coal-fired power plants. In June, the government gave final approval for construction to begin on a controversial coal mine in the state of Queensland. Environmental campaigners said they feared it could pave the way for six other mines to be approved in the area. Under the Paris climate agreement, Australia has pledged to cut emissions by 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. But while Prime Minister Scott Morrison has reiterated the government's commitment to meeting this target, the United Nations last year warned that it was not on track to do so.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Star Wars: In defence of the prequels from 1999 to 2005,"For many though they were a massive disappointment that almost ruined the memory of the original films. Criticised for the complex plot, bad acting and introduction of characters like Jar Jar Binks, they've been written off by many as an irrelevance. But we're here to say that there are some redeeming features that Star Wars fans would do well to remember. *There are spoilers here if you haven't watched the prequels yet* The Duel The final duel in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace was epic stuff. Acrobatic Sith Lord Darth Maul wielding a double ended lightsaber taking on Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn at the same time. A mean looking weapon, an incredibly dramatic soundtrack and emotional ending make for one the best fight scenes of the franchise. It's a scene that all Star Wars fans should be proud of. Count Dooku The intimidating Sith Lord was the main antagonist in Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. His story as a once respected Jedi Master who's fallen to the dark side had a real Shakespearian edge to it that showed just what the Jedi were up against. Played by legendary British actor Christopher Lee, Count Dooku's betrayal felt personal and real. A proper villain played by a proper actor, Count Dooku is a character that deserves to be part of the Star Wars franchise. Order 66 The moment the Jedi were stabbed in the back and nearly wiped out completely. There are emotional scenes in Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith when soldiers of the Republic turn on their Jedi commanders. The unsuspecting Jedi die without knowing why or what's gone wrong thanks to the deception of the evil Sith Lords. Another great, if upsetting, moment that wouldn't have seen the light of day on the silver screen if it wasn't for the prequels. Jango Fett The galaxy's deadliest bounty hunter. Having the man with the best jump pack skills in Star Wars in the prequels gave fans of the originals an insight into the early days of Boba Fett his son. Boba Fett plays a key role in the later films and is a cult favourite character. His father's death scene in Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones makes it an emotional tug at the heart strings and makes us realise why Boba turns out the way he does.

Greg Clark stands by refusal to publish Nissan letter,"Greg Clark told MPs companies had to be confident their plans would not be shared with their competitors. Nissan has said two new car ranges will be built in Sunderland, saving thousands of jobs, after ""support and assurances"" from the government about the UK's future outside the EU. Labour attacked the ""backroom deals"" and demanded the letter's release. The building of the Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland had been in doubt following the Brexit vote. In a Commons statement, Mr Clark repeated that he had assured Nissan the UK would be seeking trade that was ""free and unencumbered by impediments"" for the motor industry after Brexit. He said the carmaker's announcement was a ""massive win"" for 7,500 direct workers and the wider supply chain, adding: ""It is hard to think of more unambiguously good news."" Labour's shadow business secretary Clive Lewis welcomed the investment, but said MPs and the government were being kept in the dark on the deal - and the government's post-Brexit plans - despite Mr Clark revealing ""tantalising details"" in a BBC interview the previous day. ""Are we really to believe that Nissan are risking millions of pounds of investment and the success of its newest models on the basis of the government's intentions alone?"" Mr Lewis asked. He demanded to know what the government's plans were for other industries like steel, aerospace and pharmaceuticals. He told the minister: ""If you didn't offer a sweetener what have you got to hide - show us the letter."" Mr Clark has previously said there was ""no cheque book"" involved in the assurances given to Nissan. Replying to Mr Lewis on the subject of his letter to the carmaker, he said: ""My responsibility, on behalf of the government, is to encourage and to attract investment in this country and it's important that when companies of all types and in all sectors share with me their investment plans that are of information to their prospective competitors that they can be assured that they are not going to be disclosed to their competitors to their disadvantage."" He repeated what he said were the letter's key points: continued support for the competitiveness of the car industry, bringing more of the supply chain into the UK, backing for research and development, and seeking ""unencumbered"" trade. He also accused Labour of a ""miserable"" reaction to Nissan's announcement, asking: ""Is it beyond him to put party politics aside?""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cost overtakes green concerns in electric car debate,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter I sped round the M25 at 70mph, recharged at South Mimms service station and then returned the car. For a first experience I have to say it was great and I was very impressed. The car was quick off the mark and fun to drive. It has made me realise electric motoring is actually very achievable but the initial outlay is high - new cars cost around £20,000. It seems the debate, though, is now being framed around cost and convenience and not necessarily the environment. Zero emissions and some green credentials are clearly a benefit but the drivers I spoke to were mainly interested in the day to day cost savings. One driver said it cost him £1 a day to do 35 miles. While the perception is that we need cars to drive long distances on the ""open road"", how often do we really do that? 'Range anxiety?' Erik Fairbairn, CEO of the electric vehicle charging company POD Point, said: ""The motor industry has sold us a vision of unlimited motoring on an open road, but this does not reflect the reality of motoring in Britain. ""The biggest slice of car use is made up of small journeys and average daily motoring is just over 23 miles per car. ""Average trip lengths, for the most common routine journeys, is commuting at 8.8 miles, business trips at 19.4 miles, the school run at 2.3 miles, shopping at 4.3 miles, visiting friends at 8.7 miles and entertainment at 7.3 miles."" An interesting bit of research has emerged from London Metropolitan University. Researchers gave 340 motorists electric cars and the results were overwhelmingly positive. Psychology lecturer Dr Louise Bunce said: ""Despite initial scepticism, drivers quickly adapted to the vehicles and were extremely positive about aspects of its performance, including its acceleration and speed. ""Drivers soon discovered that recharging their vehicle was more convenient than having to stop en route to refuel at a petrol station. ""Not to mention, it costs around a mere £2 to go 100 miles. There are zero tail-pipe emissions for the health-conscious and people felt environmentally and socially responsible while at the wheel."" But there are still hurdles. Range anxiety still haunts some drivers and there could be more charging points in the capital - remember the Mayor once talked about the dream of having 25,000 charging points? Funding cuts meant Transport for London's (TfL) contribution was scaled back from 2,500 charging points to 1,300 due by 2013. At the moment there are 790, mostly in Westminster, so it is obviously not a mayoral priority. But with petrol prices only going one way, and when new cheaper models appear on the market, it is hard not to see more and more Londoners buying electric cars. That will also force the issue up the political agenda.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: 'I’m one of those people who’s been left out',"If his company supplying marquees to outdoor events goes bust, the taxman will get paid, but his reputation as a businessman will be ruined forever. ""If I shut the business down, I then become director of a business that's gone bankrupt, at which stage getting loans in the future becomes nigh-on impossible,"" he told the BBC. ""I feel like I'm one of those people who's been left out. We don't need a lot to keep going,"" said Mr Wilding, of Cannock in the West Midlands. ""The government say their support system is the best in the world, we've done furlough, this that and whatever, but it's not getting to all the people that need it."" Apart from the Bounce Back Loan scheme, his two-person business has received no government assistance. His colleague was furloughed in March last year, but because Mr Wilding is the director, he is not allowed to furlough himself. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) is particularly concerned about people like Mr Wilding. It says directors of small companies, who pay themselves in dividends rather than drawing a salary, are not receiving any help from the government. The FSB says somewhere between 700,000 and 1.1 million people fall into this category. It has put forward ideas to help some of those firms, which it hopes ministers will adopt. The FSB's proposed Directors Income Support Scheme would pay them grants of up to £7,500 to cover three months of lost trading profits. It would be limited to those who earn less than £50,000 a year. ""Company directors, the newly self-employed, those in supply chains and those without commercial premises are still being left out in the cold,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Bankruptcy fears Without further government help to cope with the effects of the pandemic, a record 250,000 small businesses could be lost in the next 12 months, the FSB said. ""The development of business support measures has not kept pace with intensifying restrictions,"" Mr Cherry added. ""As a result, we risk losing hundreds of thousands of great, ultimately viable small businesses this year, at huge cost to local communities and individual livelihoods."" The FSB based its prediction on a survey of 1,400 small firms, 5% of which said they expected to close this year. If those figures were replicated across the country, some 250,000 of the UK's 5.9 million small firms could disappear, it said. Mr Cherry said the government had met the latest national lockdown ""with a whimper"" and called for help that went beyond the retail, leisure and hospitality businesses. The FSB said it had submitted its support scheme proposals to the Treasury and was expecting a decision this month. The Treasury said nothing was planned at present, but added: ""Our support schemes are designed to get help to those who need it most whilst protecting the taxpayer from fraud, but of course we keep everything under review and are always open to further ideas.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Paris police officers suspended over beating of black music producer,"The incident on Saturday has prompted a fresh outcry over the conduct of French security forces. On Monday police were accused of using unnecessary force as they dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in Paris. The incidents come as the government tries to bring in laws banning the broadcast of police officers' faces. Critics of the legislation say that without such images, none of the incidents which took place over the past week would have come to light. On Thursday, French football star Kylian Mbappe, who is black, joined national teammates and fellow athletes in condemning the latest incident. ""Unbearable video, unacceptable violence. Say no to racism,"" he wrote on Twitter next to a picture of the bloodied face of the injured producer, who has been named only as Michel. The security camera video was published on Thursday by the online news site Loopsider. It shows three officers kicking, punching and using their truncheons on the man after he entered his studio. Loopsider said he had initially been stopped for not wearing a mask. Michel said that he was also subjected to racist abuse during the five minute beating. He was detained and charged with violence and resisting arrest, but prosecutors threw the charges out and instead opened an investigation against the officers. As he arrived at police headquarters on Thursday with his lawyer to file a complaint, Michel told reporters: ""People who should have been protecting me attacked me. I did nothing to deserve this. I just want these three people to be punished according to the law."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was ""profoundly shocked"" by the ""intolerable act"". Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told French television that he would press for the officers' dismissal, saying they had ""soiled the uniform of the republic"". Earlier this week Mr Darmanin ordered police to provide a full report after they violently dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in the capital, clashing with migrants and activists. He tweeted that some of the scenes were ""shocking"". Meanwhile, the French government is pressing ahead with its controversial security bill, which opponents say could undermine the media's ability to scrutinise police behaviour. Article 24 of the bill makes it a criminal offence to post images of police or soldiers on social media which are deemed to target them as individuals. The government argues that the new bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses. But in the face of criticism the government added an amendment, specifying that Article 24 ""will only target the dissemination of images clearly aimed at harming a police officer's or soldier's physical or psychological integrity"". People found guilty could be punished by a year in prison or a fine of up to €45,000 (£40,000).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Marks and Spencer sees first profit rise for four years,"Underlying profit before tax rose 6.1% to £661.2m for the year to 28 March, better than analysts' forecasts. Its food business had an ""outstanding year"", M&S said, but sales of general merchandise - which includes clothing - were below expectations. However, sales of womenswear rose in the final quarter. Chief executive Marc Bolland told the BBC's Today Programme that the improved results came despite the most difficult retail market in 15 years. He also said that the company was confident in the strength of its clothing range. ""We've never had more design capability,"" Mr Bolland said. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor Profits are up at Marks and Spencer - but at a cost. Capital expenditure on modernising shops and an online revamp has fallen to £526m for the year compared to £710m last year. But it still totals over £3bn in the last five years. Compare that to £700m at Next over the same period. M&S investors will be pleased that gross margins are improving, meaning that M&S is resorting to fewer money-off promotions to drive sales. Dividends are also up. But there are still major question marks over the vital womenswear department. Yes, the final quarter of the year saw sales up, but online problems over Christmas and the third warmest autumn on record all weighed heavily on sales over the year, which were down. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, knows that he has to show consistent growth in womenswear before he can pronounce ""job done"". Like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in store space - of general merchandise fell 3.1% over the year. M&S said it had suffered from the mild weather last autumn - the third warmest on record - which had hit sales of knitwear and coats. However, it said sales had returned to growth in the January-to-March period. It also said profit margins had seen ""strong improvement"". Food sales rose 0.6% on a like-for-like basis, and despite intense competition, M&S said it had outperformed the market. Online sales were down 2% over the year, with M&S being hit by problems at its distribution centre over the key Christmas trading period. However, sales increased in the fourth quarter. M&S said it was raising its dividend by 5.9% and also announced a £150m share buyback programme. Analysts broadly welcomed the news. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ""The increase in the dividend and the announcement of a share buyback programme are both supportive and indicative of future confidence in prospects, whilst the company also continues to bear down on costs.""

"Isle of Man can 'beat Covid-19 again', say residents","The island had scrapped most virus restrictions after keeping infections under control and residents had enjoyed a life free from social distancing. But a new cluster of infections - some linked to New Year's Eve celebrations - has prompted a fresh shutdown. Two new cases on Wednesday brought the total number to 389 since March. Twenty-five people have died, including 20 who were residents at Abbotswood Nursing Home. Warning over 14 venues visited by new Covid cases From midnight non-essential businesses closed, gatherings have been banned, people must once again socially distance and border restrictions have been raised to the highest level. One resident said she was ""optimistic"" the island could ""eliminate"" the virus from the community again. Coffee shop owner Bev Clegg said the changes had surprised her, but they were ""absolutely the right decision to make"" and she believed the island could regain its ""Covid-free"" status. ""The Isle of Man is a great community and if everyone plays their part then, hopefully, we can keep it to three weeks,"" she added. Gym owner David Pearson said there had been ""no consideration"" of financial support for the fitness industry, which would ""lose out"". The government had ""definitely made a mistake"" in previously relaxing border restrictions, he added. Katherine Garrood in Douglas was due to move house on Friday but said an initial ""lack of guidance"" meant she had to postpone. Mrs Garrood said the changes had ""come out of the blue"" and the severity had surprised her, but she was ""optimistic"" the island could banish the virus again. Jenny Elliott works at a pub in Douglas and her employers closed the venue about 30 minutes after the new 21-day lockdown measures were announced. Although she will have to seek financial support from the government during the period, Ms Elliot said she would ""prefer to have a lockdown, get rid of it and carry on as we were"". ""We were Covid-free before because we did a hard and fast lockdown, so I can see why people would want to do the same again,"" she added. Suzanne O'Sullivan, of Tromode, said the restrictions were about ""short-term pain for a long-term benefit"" and had faith the island could ""resume normal service"" soon. ""We have to work towards a target of elimination than management,"" she said. Helen Jessop, who lives in Ballasalla, said the Manx people were ""quite stubborn"" and had done ""so much better than anyone could have predicted"" during the previous lockdown. She said: ""I'm quietly confident we can do that again. We did it last time, even with all of the uncertainty"". The government is due to review the new lockdown on 27 January.

Family Guy's Cleveland enlists music stars,"By Greg CochraneNewsbeat music reporter The series, showing on E4 in the UK, and created by Family Guy boss Seth MacFarlane follows the adventures of Cleveland Brown and his family. Mike Henry, who voices the main character said: ""Kanye could not be a cooler guy at our show - we do definitely have some jokes where he makes light of himself."" ""He does some things out in public that stir up controversy and opinions. He knew that and we contacted him and he was totally up for doing the part."" 'Cool' guy The show, which began in the US last autumn and is already commissioned for a second season, has managed to enlist a number of big name musicians including the outspoken rapper. ""He's a recurring character,"" says Henry of Kanye West, who voices a character called Kenny West in the show. ""He does an extended rap-off with Cleveland Jnr in an episode first season and he and Cleveland hook up and do another rap in season two. ""The first time we had actually written a rap for him. Five of our writers sat down to write this rap and they were like, 'I wonder how he's going to like it?'. ""But he was genuinely laughing. He very humbly asked if we could change one line which didn't feel right. He was even joking that we should write a song for his next album."" More stars Of course, this isn't a new idea. Over the past two decades we've seen cameos from the likes of Green Day, Aerosmith and, most recently, Coldplay in shows like The Simpsons. Other music stars lined up to take part in season two of The Cleveland Show are Black Eyed Pea's will.i.am and rapper T Pain - who'll play sidekicks for Cleveland Jnr. ""We just recorded him last week and he was absolutely hilarious. He could do his own animated show he's got so many voices,"" says Henry of Will.i.am. U2's drummer Larry Mullen Jnr also got in touch with the programme's creators through a mutual friend and asked to be involved. ""He came in and we hung out for a couple of hours. We just recorded him doing a couple of different parts and he was very funny. ""It's a thrill for me to do all this. U2 is my favourite band of all time and David Lynch the film director plays a part on our show. ""He [Mullen Jnr] plays a mobster in one episode; he plays a bad Elvis impersonator by design in another episode. ""He's got his own studio so we just record it from Dublin. You don't have to record at a certain time. It's an easy gig and one that people like to do. ""It's very cool to have all these people from different walks of entertainment participating in what we're doing."" The Cleveland Show airs at 10pm on E4 every Monday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Former Stonehenge A303 road proposal 'still popular locally',"A re-routing of the A303 between the Countess and Long Barrow roundabouts was suggested before a 2004 public enquiry, according to Ian West. He said he believed ""more than 90% of local residents"" would choose this over the government's £2bn tunnel option. Highways England said it was committed to considering suggested alternatives. Congestion on the A303 £1.4bn Proposed cost of Stonehenge tunnel 1.8 miles is the length of the proposed tunnel (2.9km) 9.6 sq m around Stonehenge is a World Heritage site (25 sq km) 33% of the route is single carriageway 84 years since the A-road opened In it, the Liberal Democrat county councillor for Till and Wylye Valley said he wanted to present an alternative to the tunnel ""for serious consideration"". 'Local support' The idea is for a surface-laid dual carriageway to the south of the single carriageway currently in use. ""Over the last 23 years or so that I have represented this area on the council, this scheme has been suggested by many residents to me and I believe it has a great deal of local support and merit,"" he wrote. Mr West also represents Wiltshire County Council on the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Steering Group. Among the benefits he lists are that it is the cheapest option, has the shortest completion time and is not visible from Stonehenge. But he did admit there could be a loss of archaeology with this route cutting across the World Heritage Site. Chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, Andy Rhind-Tutt, is opposed to this road plan and said: ""Any further damage to arguably the most significant prehistoric landscape in the world must be prevented at all costs."" He would rather see a major bypass of nearby Salisbury and removing the A303 altogether from the World Heritage Site. Highways England said it was aiming to launch a public consultation early next year. ""As we develop our proposals in compliance with the statutory processes, we will consult a variety of stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, road users and interested parties,"" a spokeswoman said. In January the government awarded a £17.5m design contract for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) road tunnel near the ancient stones to ease congestion on the A303. A similar tunnel scheme for the route, which links London and the South West, was dropped in 2007 because of the spiralling cost.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Thailand election date set and campaign ban lifted,"The announcement ends a ban on political campaigning brought in when the military ousted the elected government in a coup four years ago. The military has always insisted it intends to restore democracy in Thailand. But the election date has been pushed back repeatedly. The military took power in Thailand in 2014, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the hugely popular Pheu Thai party. Military leaders said at the time they were restoring order after months of political unrest which had at times turned violent. They later drew up a new constitution and changes to the electoral system, which were approved by the public in a referendum in 2017. The constitution effectively ensures that even after the election, the military will remain an influential force in politics. It will be able to appoint the senate, which in turn will help choose the next prime minister. Dozens of people have been detained and charged since the military banned political activity and gatherings of more than five people in an attempt to prevent more of the frequent large scale protests seen over the years. But an announcement on Tuesday said political parties ""should be able to campaign to present their policies"" so the junta had ""decided to amend or abolish the laws"". Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932. It has promised not to intervene after the next elections but has already delayed them several times. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the new electoral system has been drawn up in a way that clearly disadvantages Pheu Thai, the strongest party in the country for two decades. The party remains closely linked to its previous ousted leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile after being convicted of corruption. Much will depend on how well popular support for the party has held up under military rule, says our correspondent. If it does well enough in the election, it may try to form a government, despite likely resistance from the military.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Expert ""suspected"" Shakespeare folio theft accused","Richard Kuhta was given the damaged book by Raymond Scott in Washington DC. Mr Scott, 53, from Wingate, County Durham, denies taking the folio from Durham University in 1998, and waiting 10 years to sell it. Mr Kuhta of the Folger Shakespeare Library, told Newcastle Crown Court he was immediately suspicious of Mr Scott. The library called in the British Embassy, Durham Police and the FBI after being given the badly damaged book in 2008. The court heard Mr Scott posed as a wealthy international playboy who claimed to have discovered the Shakespeare's first folio when holidaying in Cuba. But experts at the library soon discovered the artefact, which had pages missing and its bindings and cover removed, was a unique 1623 first printing of the bard's collected works stolen in a raid at Durham University in December 1998. Scott, who has denied theft, handling and transporting stolen goods, intended to sell the book at auction then share the money with friends in Cuba, the trial heard. Experts estimated the first folio to be worth £1m, even in its damaged state. They said in terms of its cultural value it was priceless. Mr Kuhta said: ""He said he'd inherited his father's construction building supplies business and had sold it and as a result he was very comfortably off. ""He said he had something to show me. He started flicking through the pages very quickly showing me it was a first edition. ""I was startled by the way in which the book was being handled and by the sudden realisation that the man seemed to know it was a first edition. ""My heart sank. It was a feeling of sadness to think we were dealing with stolen property. ""The collections are what we live for, preserving them, building them, making them accessible. ""This is one of the most important books not just in the history of literature but in the English language."" Mr Scott, had hoarded the folio at the former council home he shared with his elderly mother in Washington, Tyne and Wear, since stealing it, the court heard. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish economy 'needs better balance',"The EY Scottish Item Club has forecast output growth at 1.9% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. That compares with predicted UK growth rates of 2.5% and 2.4%, respectively. While construction output is forecast to soar by 14.6% this year, growth of only 1.3% is anticipated in services. In a report, the item club warned that the imbalance could lead to ""vulnerability for future growth, unless the performance of private services picks up"". Its forecast of 1.9% growth in Scotland in 2015 was a revision downwards from its previous prediction of 2.2%. The report said sectors suffering falls in output included financial services, extraction, metals and public administration. On a positive note, water, electricity and gas and chemicals are all expected to enjoy growth rates of more than 5% this year, while a pick-up is expected in the retail and wholesale sectors. Next year, ""modest"" employment gains are anticipated for Scotland overall, with an additional 8,000 jobs. Dougie Adams, senior economic advisor to the club, said: ""Although Scotland has been impacted by the effects of lower oil prices on North Sea-related activity, weak growth in private services is a major cause of this year's shortfall in comparison to UK growth. ""The private services sectors expected growth of 1.3% in Scotland is well below trend and compares with growth of well over 3% in the UK. ""And, as in the UK, stalling world trade growth held back manufacturing."" The club anticipates construction output to rise sharply this year as a result of major projects such as the Forth Crossing and the M8, M73, M74 enhancements. However, the report warned that the growth in the sector may not be sustainable. Mr Adams said: ""Construction represents around 6% of the Scottish economy yet accounts for 40% of GDP growth over the last two years. ""It is an impressive performance but one that may not be sustainable. What happens when the major projects come to an end, and will these improvements to Scotland's infrastructure drive up productivity in the longer-term? ""Scotland's economy has been buoyed by the construction industry but this has created an overdependence of growth on this one sector. ""Scotland needs more balanced growth across the sectors in order to secure sustainable growth."" He added: ""With construction output expected to pull back to just 3% in 2016, this means the forecast of continuing GDP growth requires a return to form in key areas such as professional and administrative services where growth is forecast to return to trend of about 4% in 2016.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Faces of Egyptian mummies on show in Manchester,"The portraits painted on to panels that covered the heads of mummies form part of an exhibition at the city's John Rylands Library. The panels, which have rarely been shown in public, were bequeathed to Manchester Museum by cotton magnate Jesse Haworth in 1921. The museum's Egyptology curator Campbell Price said they depicted people who looked ""strikingly modern"". The paintings, known as Fayum portraits after the region near Cairo where they were found, were discovered on archaeological digs in 1888 and 1911 by William Flinders Petrie. They date back to about AD 150, when Egypt was part of the Roman Empire. 'A rare window' Petrie's excavations were funded by Haworth and many of his finds went on to form part of Haworth's private Egyptology collection. Mr Price said the institution was ""incredibly excited"" to be showing the portraits. ""What is particularly fascinating about them is that the people portrayed by the artists often look as if they are Greek and Roman, rather than traditionally Egyptian, indicating just how much of a melting pot Egypt was 2,000 years ago,"" he said. ""The portraits can often be dated by their hairstyles or jewellery - showing how quickly fashions changed almost two millennia ago. ""They appear strikingly modern and grab your attention in ways traditional Egyptian mummy masks do not."" The University of Manchester's Dr Roberta Mazza, who has helped curate the exhibition, said the artefacts offered ""a rare window into people's lives at a key point in Egyptian history, when Egypt was part of a wider Mediterranean world dominated by the Roman Empire"". 'Forgotten history' Papyri containing extracts of the apocryphal Gospel of Mary, the original of which has been credited by some to Mary Magdalene, and census documents are also on show. The papyri were collected by John Rylands Library founder Enriqueta Rylands in the early years of the 20th Century. Exhibition co-curator Professor Kate Cooper said the papers showed ""a forgotten side of history"". ""For example, the Gospel of Mary fragment argues that women should have a leadership role in the Christian church, a view which the medieval Church tried to suppress,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Serious concerns' remain over funeral pricing,"But in a much-awaited and delayed report into the sector, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ruled out setting price controls. The CMA said the coronavirus pandemic had prevented that option from being developed. It has told funeral directors and crematoria to make prices clearer and warned it may look at the issue again. Previous commentary has likened the sector to ""the Wild West"", as funeral directors are unregulated in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The industry has been waiting for nearly two years for the CMA's conclusions regarding the cost of funerals, crematoria, and other charges faced by families organising a funeral. In August, the CMA said that the Covid-19 outbreak had made it almost impossible to test more radical options for the sector. Now, in its final report, it has confirmed that price controls will be ruled out for the time-being. But it said it should consider whether a further investigation of the sector was needed when conditions were more stable. That threat has been criticised by smaller funeral directors. ""The proposal for a second market investigation is simply disruptive and appears to be a blanket approach that fails to tackle those large businesses which drove excessive funeral price inflation. It needs to be more nuanced, segmented and specific."" said Terry Tennens, chief executive of the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors. New rules It ordered that funeral directors and crematorium operators: Some practices, such as payments to incentivise hospitals or care homes to refer people to specific directors, will be banned. The CMA also wants the government to set up an independent inspection and registration regime for funeral director services. ""Organising a funeral is often very distressing and people can be especially vulnerable during this time,"" said CMA panel inquiry chairman Martin Coleman. ""That's why our remedies are designed to help people make choices that are right for them and ensure they can be confident that their loved one is in good hands."" A report earlier this year by insurer SunLife suggested the average cost of a basic funeral has risen by more than 9% in a year in some regions, with the cost typically £4,417. The pre-paid funeral sector has been subject to separate inquiries. Planned legislation by the government will see the City watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority - take responsibility for regulation of that sector. This is expected by the summer of 2022. Advice for families There is a state safety net, the Funeral Expenses Payment, available to people in England and Wales on certain benefits, but critics say it still leaves a shortfall that has to be picked up by families. It also operates in Northern Ireland, but is claimed differently. There is a similar scheme in Scotland, known as the Funeral Support Payment.

Charles Bronson cleared of trying to attack prison governor,"Bronson, 66, had been accused of attacking Mark Docherty and threatening to gouge his eyes out at HMP Wakefield. He told Leeds Crown Court he had meant to give the governor a ""gentle bear hug"" but tripped and fell. Bronson did a celebratory jig as jurors found him not guilty and he then described British justice as ""the best in the world"". After the verdict, judge Tom Bayliss QC said to Bronson, who has changed his named to Charles Salvador: ""You seem pleased with that, Mr Salvador."" Appearing on video link from HMP Frankland, Bronson, who is currently serving a life term for robbery and kidnap, smiled and replied: ""British justice, best in the world. Thank you."" Mr Docherty told the court that Bronson, who represented himself, had attacked him at the start of a welfare meeting at the jail on 25 January before prison officers restrained the inmate. More news from across Yorkshire Bronson admitted that he partly blamed the governor after he was told photographs of his prison wedding to Paula Williamson in November 2017 would not be allowed to leave the jail until his release. But he denied attacking the governor and said he intended to whisper ""where's my wife's photos"" in what he described as a ""wake-up call"" to the prison chief to not mess with his family. During his trial, Bronson admitted he had been a ""very nasty man"" in the past, as he described to the jury how in his 44 years in prison he had held 11 hostages in nine different sieges - including governors, doctors, staff and, on one occasion, his solicitor. 'Not enough hugs' But giving evidence, he told jurors that for the first time in his life he was an ""innocent man"". Bronson said: ""Since when is it a crime to hug your fellow man? There is not enough man hugs in this insane world today. ""I say from my heart and my soul, it's a sure way of bonding and bringing peace on earth. ""It should not be a criminal offence to show a little humanity, especially inside our prisons and asylums."" He told the court that he was in a Category A prison ""still in isolation, probably will be for years to come"" but his ""life was picking up"" in recent times. Jurors found Bronson not guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent after deliberating for less than three hours.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: New York City orders international visitors to quarantine,"Mayor Bill de Blasio said all visitors would be ordered to stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. He said anyone arriving from the UK would be visited by sheriff's deputies to ensure they abide by the rules. Those who breach them will be fined $1,000 (£737) a day, Mr de Blasio warned. About 18.4m coronavirus cases and more than 326,000 deaths have been recorded across the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. New York City was at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, and has again become one of the country's worst-affected states. In a statement, Mayor de Blasio said all inbound international travellers must provide their contact details. ""We are really serious about the fact that if you violate quarantine you're creating a danger for everyone else,"" said Mr de Blasio. ""We are in the final battle here, all we have to do is get through these holidays,"" he added. Dozens of countries - including nearly all 27 EU states - have already imposed restrictions on travel from the UK, as governments clamp down on the spread of coronavirus over the Christmas period. What are the new Covid-19 variants? This week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that a new strain of coronavirus was behind a surge in cases in the country. Then on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yet another variant - originating in South Africa - had been detected in the country. The two variants are still being analysed, but the government said it was confident that both are more easily transmittable than other strains. But the UK government said its new, tougher lockdown measures would help to contain the spread. What's the latest in the US? America continues to report the world's highest total cases and Covid-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. In all, about 5% of the US population are known to have been infected since the pandemic began. Daily cases have been at record levels since early November, and many states are overwhelmed with hospitalisation numbers. US regulators have recently approved two vaccines - one by Moderna, and another by Pfizer and BioNTech - and over 9.4 million doses have been shipped nationwide, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The government has also signed a deal with Pfizer to buy an additional 100 million doses of the its vaccine. But last week, a US general in charge of distributing the jabs apologised after many states learned they would be receiving fewer vaccines than expected. As of Wednesday, over one million Americans had had their first jab, the CDC said. Earlier this year, the government pledged to inoculate 20 million people by the end of 2020.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis' big decisions,"By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales politcal reporter He has six local education authorities in special measures to be deal with. He has the results of an international tests for school children to look forward to - the so-called Pisa results that Wales has performed very poorly over the last few years. They're due later in the year so he will be scrutinised on those. And there are big decisions coming up on higher education in the way student finance works. The Welsh government has gone its own way on that over the past few years, but is that sustainable as we get closer to the next assembly election? Those are the big decisions that fall on Mr Lewis to make. Leighton Andrews has left Wales with this idea that education across the board is somehow underachieving. There have been this big failures in the past so the question for Mr Lewis is does he agree with that and how does he cope with the legacy that's been left by Mr Andrews? He is a thoughtful politician, and he is a very principled politician. It's worth remembering he's resigned twice from the Welsh government from more junior jobs than this one. He was the man First Minister Carwyn Jones beat to the Welsh Labour leadership back in 2009 and since then he's had quite a low profile, it's fair to say. But that's all going to change now. Mr Lewis is a very tribal politician in one way and very quick to attack his political opponents - we'll hear a great of that from the Senedd chamber, I'm sure. He was portrayed in that leadership election as being on the left wing of the Labour party although I'm not sure that is quite fair. He is certainly a party man and worked for the Labour party before being elected, and before that he was a teacher so he does have some background in education. Mr Lewis can be fiery when he has to be but he is a thoughtful man and I believe he will bring a different tone to the job than we saw from Leighton Andrews. But I don't think he's going to hold back in the same way Mr Andrews didn't hold back when he thought that Welsh education and Welsh institutions weren't really performing in the way they wanted them to.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Smart motorways to be reviewed over driver safety fears,"Grant Shapps told MPs: ""We know people are dying on smart motorways"". He said recommendations are expected ""in a matter of weeks"" to ensure all motorways are ""as safe as they possibly can be"". Earlier this week, Highways England boss Jim O'Sullivan warned ""dynamic"" smart motorways are ""too complicated"" for drivers. Mr O'Sullivan said he did not think he would build any more dynamic smart motorways because too many motorists do not understand them. There are two types of smart motorway in the UK: The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy, and the second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time. They already account for about 400 miles of England's roads, including sections of major motorways like the M1, M6, and M62. They were created to ease congestion, using computers to monitor the roads and change speed limits. Critics have called for smart motorways to be scrapped over safety concerns and several deaths. Eight-year-old Dev Naran was killed on the M6 last May when a lorry struck his grandfather's Toyota while it was pulled up on the hard shoulder, which was in use. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Transport Select Committee, Mr Shapps said: ""I have asked my department to carry out at pace an evidence stock-take to gather the facts quickly and make recommendations."" He said his department would lead the review ""because some of the statistics have been difficult to understand, and we know people are dying on smart motorways"". He added: ""Understanding whether they are less safe, the same or safer - it turns out not to be as straightforward as members might imagine - I want all of those facts and recommendations that can be put into place to ensure that all of our motorways are as safe as they possibly can be. ""I will get this done in a matter of weeks."" Derek Jacobs, 83, was killed when his car was hit after it stopped on a smart motorway section of the M1 in Derbyshire. His death came six months after another woman was killed after a breakdown on the same section of road. Jason Mercer, 44, died on the M1 near Sheffield, where the hard shoulder is an active lane. He was involved in a minor collision but when he got out his car to exchange details he and the other driver were hit by a lorry. Both died at the scene.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Analysts and retailers expect a flat full year at best for the industry following two consecutive years of rapid growth. Spending on toys totals £121 per child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD, with lower-income families cutting their spending. The industry has unveiled its list of ""must-have"" toys. Cheaper collectables feature prominently on the list, alongside more traditional games and film and TV tie-ups. Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for the NPD Group's toy division, said that sales had been ""sluggish"" in the year so far, whereas activity had risen in the other major toy markets in Europe, the US and Russia. She pointed to a correction following two years of 7% growth in the UK, which had outstripped other markets and had been driven in part by the success of the Star Wars franchise. Seven of the 10 best-selling toys of the year so far have had a price tag of less than £10, she said. Toy facts Source: Toy Retailers' Association/NPD Alan Simpson, chairman of the Toy Retailers' Association, which compiles the Dream Toys list, said the weakness of the pound had pushed up prices in the UK as most toys were imported. The toy market was suffering from the income squeeze of customers as much as other sectors, he added. ""However, the rule book gets thrown away at Christmas, no matter how tough things are [for parents],"" he said. Ms Tutt said that this year's list of top toys was relatively low-tech, with traditional games playing a more ""dynamic"" part in the market. ""Parents are saying that too much screen time is not good,"" she said. Only 1% of toys were ""connected"" via the internet, yet the influence of the web - and particularly social media - was clear from the design of new toys. One of the expected best-sellers at Christmas is the L.O.L. Surprise - a heavily wrapped toy inspired by ""unboxing"" videos on YouTube and other social media channels. Marketing for other toys had been launched on social media rather than TV adverts, she said. and manufacturers were counting on shared videos of youngsters playing with their new toys as another form of advertising.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greggs to open shops despite first loss in 36 years,"This is despite the chain reporting its first loss for 36 years in 2020 after sales fell by a third amid coronavirus lockdown measures. Greggs said it had ramped up deliveries, wholesale, and click-and-collect as High Street sales fell. Chief executive Roger Whiteside added that Greggs had ""made a better-than-expected start to 2021"". He added that the chain was ""well placed to participate in the recovery from the pandemic"". Sales at company-managed shops fell by more than 36% last year as footfall in city centres and travel hub sites fell substantially during lockdowns. This was partly offset by deliveries through Just Eat, which is one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms. Greggs reported a pre-tax loss of £13.7m, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984. Nevertheless, the chain is planning to open about 100 net new shops this year, adding to the 2,078 it already operates. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pandemic ""tore a huge chunk off business as it turned once bustling city centres into ghost towns"". ""Although the crisis is likely to prove a temporary interruption to our insatiable demand for sausage rolls rather than a sign of dramatically changing tastes, it is quite a sustained break, and it's going to take a toll. Greggs has previously said it doesn't expect a return to pre-Covid levels of operations until 2022 at the earliest."" John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: ""The High Street is likely to be a very different place when lockdown restrictions are fully ended, with many empty spaces and chains such as Pret re-focusing on suburban areas - the traditional heartland of Greggs. ""While these factors cannot be underestimated, the company is in good shape, with a solid balance sheet, and has a great record of rising to the challenge."" Greggs chairman Ian Durant said 2020 was ""not the year that any of us planned for"". He said the firm had started the year strongly but then temporarily closed its shops in March due to the Covid outbreak. It then reopened shops in the middle of the year. To get through the pandemic, Greggs arranged financing both from the government, which it has since repaid, and from lenders. ""Government support has been essential to mitigate the impact of Covid and protect as many jobs as possible through this period,"" Mr Durant said. He said it had been ""sad to say goodbye"" to staff whose roles had been cut by the firm ""to reflect the reality of the trading environment"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Four Irish language groups lose key funding,"Foras na Gaeilge has said it will cut the number of Irish language groups for which it provides ""core funding"" across the island of Ireland from 19 to six. None of the six successful organisations is currently based in Northern Ireland. Pobal, Iontabhas Ultach, Forbairt Feirste and Altram will lose a significant portion of their budgets. They provide support for the language in business, education and the arts in Northern Ireland. Foras said the bodies it plans to fund in the future will promote the language and provide services on an all-island basis. It agreed the plan at a board meeting in Dublin. Chief executive of Foras, Ferdie Mac an Fhailigh, said: ""`Foras na Gaeilge recognises that the six months ahead will be a difficult period for organisations whose funding from Foras na Gaeilge will come to an end following this decision. Salary bill ""And every effort will be made to ensure that the Irish-language community will not suffer as a result of these huge changes, and that the important work being done by organisations which were not selected will continue."" Foras na Gaeilge had to rationalise because a significant proportion of the money it gave out was being spent on salaries. In 2008, it allocated 40% of its budget, 8m euros (£6.6m), to the 19 ""core-funded"" organisations. They used more than half of that to pay salaries. In subsequent years, the salary bill continued to increase and by 2011, close to 60% of grant money awarded was being spent on pay. In a report drawn up as part of the rationalisation plan Foras said: `""Based on the above trend, and were it to continue, most of the funding would be spent on wages and there would be a risk to service provision."" Foras na Gaeilge was set up in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement to promote the language. It is funded by the Irish government and the Northern Ireland Executive. Its own budget has been significantly reduced in recent years. The rationalisation plan was approved at a meeting of the language body of the North South Ministerial Council in July last year. The meeting was attended by Culture Minister Caral Ní Chuilín and her counterpart from the Republic of Ireland, Jimmy Deenihan TD, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Two organisations in Northern Ireland that receive core funding from Foras na Gaeilge will be protected from the changes. Radio Failte, an Irish language station based in Belfast, and an t-Aisionad, an Irish education resources centre based at St Mary's teacher training college on the Falls Road will continue to be funded under separate arrangements. The changes in funding arrangements will take effect from July.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Online health check 'broken promise' claim on over-50s in Wales,"Conservatives claim there has been a ""massive climbdown"" on a manifesto commitment of examinations with GPs. Labour pledged annual checks for the over-50s at the 2011 assembly election. Health Minister Lesley Griffiths said research raised questions about the value of universal checks and this would allow something new to be tested. In a statement, she said the health check programme would take an ""innovative and holistic approach"". Online assessments and community-based support will allow the over-50s to assess and improve their health, she said. Details on how the scheme will work will be developed by Public Health Wales and it will be introduced over three years, starting later this year. People were increasingly going online to access services at a time and place that suits them, the minister said. She added: ""I have, therefore, decided it (the health checks programme) will be delivered primarily through an online service, which will offer people high quality advice on a range of health and social issues which can be personally tailored to their own circumstances, as well as improve access to the most effective national and local prevention services. ""The health checks programme will provide a modern gateway to prevention and health information services in Wales, which can help people over the age of 50 to make choices to support better health and wellbeing."" 'U-turn' Those who cannot get online will be offered ""alternative ways"" of having a health check. Further details will be provided as the programme develops, Mrs Griffiths said. Officials had looked at research evidence which ""raised questions about the real value of universal 'health checks' based solely on a medical model and helped us design an approach which allows Wales to test something new"". About £740,000 has been set aside for the scheme in 2013-14 financial year. But opposition parties pounced on the announcement. In its manifesto, Labour said it would ""instigate a programme of annual health checks, led by GPs, practice nurses, pharmacists and other health professionals, for everyone over the age of 50 over the next assembly term"". For the Conservatives, Darren Millar said: ""This amounts to a massive climbdown from the health minister and another promise broken. ""This was a key Labour health policy in 2011 that committed this government to annual health checks with a GP for every person over 50. ""It's now clear it wasn't worth the paper it was written on."" Plaid Cymru health spokeswoman Elin Jones said she was sceptical that a website could take the place of a health professional. ""The announcement by the health minister is to all intents and purposes a U-turn on what the Labour Party committed to in its manifesto,"" she said. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: ""Welsh Labour were very proud of this much trumpeted policy, but today we have found out it is merely another Welsh Labour pledge that it can't deliver on. ""To say this policy has been watered down would be putting it mildly.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Shirley Oaks: Social services asked to be lenient with sex abuser,"The abuser ran parts of a Lambeth children's home, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard. Shirley Oaks children's home had up to 350 residents under the age of 17 living there until its closure in 1983. Barristers representing victims accused Lambeth Council of knowing about the abuse, but doing nothing. The inquiry hearing, which is due to last four weeks, is investigating whether there were child protection failures by public authorities. Authorities at Lambeth Council had learned of Michael Carroll's conviction of child abuse from Croydon Council, which was made aware of it when he and his wife applied to be foster parents there. Lambeth Council did not dismiss Carroll for the conviction, or for failing to disclose it when he applied to work there in 1978. 'Troublesome request' On Tuesday the panel heard evidence from Clive Walsh, a former probation officer and assistant director with Southwark Social Services between 1978 and 1985. He recalled a member of staff approaching him with a ""strange and troublesome request"". He told the inquiry that Southwark Council had been asked to provide an independent agreement to a fostering application of two children made to Lambeth Council by Carroll and his wife. ""Seemingly, the request came in the terms of, it wouldn't be necessary to be too rigorous, because Mr Carroll was already a head of establishment, a children's home, he was a long-serving, trusted member of staff,"" he told the panel. ""And more to the point, he and his wife were already de facto social aunt and uncle to the two boys that they were asking to foster."" Carroll was dismissed in 1991 because of ""financial irregularities"", the inquiry heard. He was jailed for 10 years at Liverpool Crown Court in 1999 after admitting a string of sexual assaults against children while working in residential care between 1966 and 1986. The inquiry also heard from Lady Boateng - former chair of Lambeth Council's social services - who denied she had attended a meeting at which officials discussed Carroll's application to foster two children. Rachel Langdale QC referred to comments made by an earlier witness, who said that Lady Boateng had attended a meeting with Southwark Council. Lady Boateng called claims she did so ""quite absurd"", adding that she did not know about Carroll's conviction when she worked at the local authority. The inquiry continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police seek man subject to TPim terror control measure,"Police say Ibrahim Magag, 28, who is of Somali origin, is not considered to ""represent a direct threat to the British public"". TPims replaced control orders in January 2012, amid some controversy. Home Office minister James Brokenshire said: ""We do not believe his disappearance is linked to any terrorism planning in the UK."" He added: ""The Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure in this case was intended to prevent fundraising and overseas travel."" TPims restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security. The identity of people under TPims are usually kept secret, but an anonymity order imposed on Mr Magag has been lifted following a request by the police. Police were alerted when he ""failed to meet his overnight residence condition"" on the night of Boxing Day. 'Call 999' Metropolitan Police Service counter-terrorism detectives have asked people to call 999 if they see him, and not approach him directly. Mr Magag is said to be 6ft 2in tall, of slim to medium build, with a beard, although police say it is possible he may try to change his appearance. He was last seen in the Camden area at 17:20 GMT on Wednesday. He was wearing a khaki robe, a black Berghaus windcheater and navy Converse trainers. In March it was revealed nine British citizens were subject to TPims. In June another man was charged with breaching the conditions of his. Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Mr Brokenshire said: ""National security is the government's top priority and the police are doing everything in their power to apprehend this man as quickly as possible. ""The home secretary, on police operational advice, today applied to the High Court for an order protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their investigation."" Police have asked anyone with information about Mr Magag, who was last seen in Camden on Boxing Day, to contact the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 321.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Third Menai crossing construction 'could start by 2021',"Consultants are to be hired later this year to look at routes for a proposed new crossing to Anglesey. Funding options to pay for the scheme are also to be examined. Plaid Cymru welcomed progress on the proposal, saying current traffic congestion in the area causes ""unnecessary misery"" for commuters. Currently, there are two Menai Strait crossings: the Menai Bridge, which was built by Thomas Telford in the 1820s, and Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge, which was opened to carry rail traffic in 1850 but rebuilt in the 20th century to also carry road traffic. The A55 runs as a dual carriageway from Holyhead to the Britannia Bridge, where it is carried as a single carriageway road, before returning to a dual carriageway on the other side. There have been proposals for a third Menai crossing for some time to alleviate traffic on the two bridges over the strait. According to a Welsh Government document, Economy Secretary Ken Skates has now ""agreed to appoint technical advisors to take forward the third crossing project"". He also decided to appoint ""external support to advise on possible financial packages to fund the project"". Dyfed Edwards, Plaid Cymru council leader for Gwynedd council, said ""it is absolutely key that there's a new crossing"" if the new Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant development ""comes into place"". ""It's not just commuter traffic, it will be construction traffic as well,"" he said. A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: ""This is a project which we have long championed yet which is sadly still to materialise due to the Labour Welsh Government's lethargy on the matter."" She said: ""Current traffic congestion causes unnecessary misery for commuters on a daily basis and there are already concerns over the existing two bridges' long-term resilience."" Russell George, the Welsh Conservatives' economy spokesman, said the project was ""long overdue"". ""The third bridge has been on the agenda for more than a decade"", he said, referring to a consultation in 2007. ""Yet the Welsh Government have done nothing,"" he added. ""The time for announcements is over - action is what is now needed."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are currently in the process of procuring consultants to carry out a route selection study for the third Menai crossing. ""This will appraise various options and designs for the third crossing and will include a public consultation. ""Construction could start in 2021 subject to gaining all the necessary statutory consents."" Consultants are expected to be hired in the autumn, with the study to take 18 months.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Iran sanctions: US moves to isolate 'major' banks,"The order will also penalise non-Iranian institutions trading with them, effectively cutting the banks off from the international financial system. The US says it is seeking to choke off Iran's access to funds to pursue what it regards as aggressive activities. Iran's UN ambassador accused the US of committing ""economic terrorism"". The latest punitive measure comes weeks after the US declared the return - or ""snapback"" - of UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted under a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear programme, accusing Tehran of having breached that agreement. Other members of the UN Security Council, however, are not in agreement with the US, saying Washington cannot trigger the snapback mechanism because it abandoned the nuclear deal in 2018. This latest US move acts upon a presidential order signed by Donald Trump in January after a missile attack by Iran on US air bases in Iraq. That attack was in retaliation for the US killing in Iraq of top Iranian commander Gen Qasem Soleimani, who controlled Iran's proxy forces across the Middle East. The US Treasury did not specify accusations against most of the banks but said 16 of the institutions were being sanctioned for what it termed ""operating in Iran's financial sector"", one for its links to an already sanctioned bank, and another for being a ""military-affiliated"" bank. Significantly, the sanctions also target foreign companies that do business with the banks, giving them 45 days to cease such activities or face ""secondary sanctions"". Announcing the measures, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the US' ""sanctions programmes will continue until Iran stops its support of terrorist activities and ends its nuclear programmes"". He said that the latest sanctions would ""continue to allow for humanitarian transactions to support the Iranian people"", such as in agriculture, food and medicine. However, observers say foreign banks are likely to be uncomfortable with trading even in these exempted areas because of the risk of being penalised. Iran has denounced the move by the US, which comes just weeks ahead of the US presidential election. Its UN ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said it was a form of ""state terrorism and economic and medical terrorism... carried out through unilateral coercive measures"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: BAME communities urged to accept vaccine,"Thornbury district nurse Genevieve Palmer was given the jab at Kingswood Health Centre in Bristol on Tuesday. She asked communities to take the vaccine ""to protect yourself, protect your family and protect everybody."" A Royal Society for Public Health survey found that BAME groups were less likely to want the Covid vaccine. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showing that black people are almost twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as white people, with those of Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnicity about 1.7 times as likely. Ms Palmer said she was ""very happy"" to receive the inoculation but admitted there was scepticism in the BAME community, even among her friends. ""When I was coming here, I ran into some friends from my background and when I said I'm going to get my Covid vaccine it wasn't well accepted, people were asking 'are you sure?' ""I just want to tell them, everyone in my ethnic minority, it's very safe, go and have it to protect yourself, protect your family and protect everybody. ""I want to encourage them to get out there and have it. Do your research, stop believing what you see on Youtube, it doesn't help."" Dr Neil Kerfoot is leading the vaccination programme at Kingswood Health Centre. He said that first in line were people aged over 80 and they had taken into account patients' other illnesses, vulnerability and ethnicity when planning the order of vaccinations for the community. ""I think it rates as one of the most complicated and challenging, but also one of the most exciting things we've done,"" said the GP. Christina Marriott, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), said ""anti-vaccination messages have been specifically targeted"" at some ethnic and religious communities through mediums such as messaging service WhatsApp. Meanwhile, Bristol City Council said working with Somali, Sudanese and Pakistani communities in schools, cafes and housing estates has helped to bring the city's coronavirus case numbers down. The council and its health partners focused on areas including Barton Hill, Lawrence Hill, Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston. Deputy mayor for communities Asher Craig said they had seen numbers ""plummet"" particularly in areas where there are significant BAME communities.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The Last Of Us Part II: 'A game about bad people doing bad things to survive',"But finally, the wait for fans is nearly over. Sony has announced the release date for The Last Of Us Part II. They've also dropped a new trailer - packed with action, horror and emotional reunions. But how do you follow such an acclaimed game? And did it need a sequel at all? The Last of Us Part II is due for release on 21 February 2020 - so gamers may want to book the day off now. ""People are really excited,"" games journalist and presenter Alysia Judge tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Even people who, at the end of The Last of Us, said it was perfect and didn't need a sequel."" Perfect might be pushing things, but the first game does hold an impressive 95% score on review site Metacritic, won numerous awards and sold more than 17 million copies worldwide. 'Killing felt exactly how it should; Awful' Alysia says it achieved this success, in part, because the game's makers, Naughty Dog (the team behind Crash Bandicoot and Uncharted) mixed powerful storytelling, amazing visuals and asking more of gamers than most big-budget titles. ""It's about bad people doing bad things to survive. Killing someone here felt exactly how it should: awful,"" says Alysia. ""It wasn't just another game about zombies, it's about humans and people - and ultimately the relationship at its core between Joel and Ellie. ""Its graphics were insanely amazing and then it combines that with this really strong narrative."" The Last of Us was released in 2013 toward the end of the PlayStation 3's time wedged under our televisions and The Last Of Us Part II comes as many people expect Sony to start winding up the PlayStation 4. But while many fans are getting hyped about the new trailer and release date, Alysia says she'll be keeping calm until February. 'We'll only know what it's like when we play it' After all, Naughty Dog has previous when it comes to misleading gamers. ""In this game, it looks like you're playing Ellie for the majority of it... but we'll see,"" she says. She's still burned from how Naughty Dog stayed vague about Joel and Ellie's relationship before the release of the original game, and what the characters were on the road to achieve. ""Naughty Dog often play with fans' expectations for the trailer, I feel like we'll only really know what the sequel is like once we start playing it.""

Edward Snowden 'smeared by UK officials',"The Sunday Times reported that Moscow and Beijing had ""cracked"" a secret cache of files taken by Mr Snowden. It said some Western intelligence agents had been removed from ""hostile countries"" because information leaked by Mr Snowden showed how they work. The Sunday Times stands by its story. Mr Snowdon's leaks in 2013 revealed surveillance carried out by US intelligence. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who helped break the original stories, told the BBC there was ""zero evidence"" to support claims Russia and China had gained access to the documents. He criticised what he called ""anonymous cowards in the British government"" who had spoken to the Sunday Times. Mr Snowden, now living in Russia, left the US in 2013 after leaking to the media details of extensive internet and phone surveillance by American intelligence. 'Zero evidence' His information made international headlines in June 2013 when the Guardian newspaper reported the US National Security Agency was collecting the telephone records of tens of millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is believed to have downloaded 1.7 million secret documents before he left the US. His actions have been praised by civil liberties campaigners but criticised by intelligence officials, who say the leaks pose security risks. Mr Greenwald told the BBC's Today programme: ""All this story is are people inside the government who have an obvious interest in smearing Snowden. ""They don't have the courage to put their names on these allegations so they remain anonymous. ""There's zero evidence for them. There's all kinds of reasons to believe they're not true. ""It's not journalism it's just acting as subservient stenographers for the government."" According to the Sunday Times, Moscow had gained access to more than one million classified files held by Mr Snowden. A UK government source told the BBC Russia and China had information that had led to agents being moved but added there was no evidence any had been harmed. Mr Greenwald said Mr Snowden had told him he did not take documents with him when he went to Russia because he feared he would be hacked. 'Well-informed sources' He said: ""Snowden told me before he left Hong Kong that he had intended to destroy the set and he has said publicly many times that he gave all the copies he had to journalists."" Mr Greenwald said there had been ""a huge shift"" in the media narrative towards a ""pro-Snowden sentiment"". He added: ""And as soon as the Snowden narrative shifts, up pops anonymous, unnamed cowards in the British government to smear him with these evidence-free claims and I think that's really the story."" A spokesman for The Sunday Times said: ""This story was responsible journalism and another example of The Sunday Times setting the news agenda. ""We reported what various reliable and well-informed sources from within the government told us. ""We fully stand by our story, as did the BBC which also had it confirmed by government sources in its reporting yesterday.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Firefighters in Scotland reject pay deal for second time,"It is the second time union members have rejected the deal. They had been offered a pay rise in return for taking on new responsibilities, including responding to ""slips, trips and falls"". The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said it respected the result but firefighters pay would now have to be negotiated at UK level. Last year the SFRS said firefighters must take on a broadened role in supporting vulnerable people The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) described such roles as health and social care work, and said it was determined to continue negotiations. In return for taking on the extra duties, firefighters would have seen their basic pay rise in stages from October 2019 to July 2022 by 14.74%, with an overall increase from July 2019 to July 2022 of 17%. FBU Scotland secretary Denise Christie said that while members ""deserve"" a pay increase, the offer on the table was ""unacceptable"". She said: ""We've been consistent throughout negotiations. Real progress has been made since the last offer was rejected in June, but some serious changes are needed to make this acceptable to our members. ""The SFRS need to listen to the concerns of their staff and get back around the negotiating table."" The deal, rejected by a majority of 60% to 40% on an 81% turnout, would also have meant more responsibility for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which could have seen firefighters co-responding to life-threatening injuries. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said that while firefighters were emergency responders, they were ""no substitute for social care staff"". He said: ""In negotiations, we were concerned that this offer would not be acceptable to our members in Scotland - and this clear result serves as proof. ""We continue to be entirely open to discussions about securing a fire and rescue service fit for the challenges of the future. This is not the time to walk away from negotiations. ""We need to find a deal that is fair for firefighters and control staff to secure a long-overdue pay increase."" The original pay offer from SFRS was rejected by union members in July. SFRS chief officer Martin Blunden said it was ""regrettable"" that an agreement had not been reached, but that he respected the ballot result. He said: ""We have been in a unique position in Scotland, having secured funding from our government, to bring forward a 17% pay offer to broaden the role of Scottish firefighters. ""As this offer has been rejected there will be no further Scotland-only pay offer as there is now no additional funding and we will re-join the UK wide National Joint Council negotiations on firefighter pay. ""However, we remain absolutely committed to protecting Scotland's communities from harm and identifying ways to meet new and emerging risks.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lockdown party crash: South Wales PC Tasia Stephens' gross misconduct,"PC Tasia Stephens had more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in her blood when her car hit a building. The 24-year-old officer was off duty when she went to the party at her aunt's home in Treorchy, a South Wales Police tribunal heard. At the time, on Saturday 25 April, the UK was under strict stay-at-home rules. Case presenter Barney Branston told the hearing in Pencoed, Bridgend, PC Stephens went despite having an ""expectation to enforce the law"" regarding the Covid restrictions. But, the officer then took the ""extraordinary"" decision to drive after drinking, with ""no thought to other road users"", Mr Branston said. PC Stephens was said to have started drinking at the party, where members of her family told her of historical sex allegations against a family member, the hearing was told. On leaving at midnight, Mr Branston said she made the ""poor decision"" to get into her car and after driving only about 1,650ft (500m), on-duty colleagues recognised her vehicle. They stopped her, but at that stage had ""no suspicion"" she was over the drink-drive limit. ""She carried on driving for around 1.6 miles before crashing,"" Mr Branston said. Police were contacted by people who heard the crash, in Gelli Road, Pentre. They found PC Stephens ""upset, saying she wanted to kill herself"" and making reference to the crime said to have been committed by a family member, Mr Branston said. On failing a breath test, she was taken to a police station, where she was was found to have 90mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit is 80mg. On 10 July at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court, PC Stephens pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol 'Undermined public confidence' She was given a 12-month conditional discharge and a 15-month driving ban. Saying she had brought, or would likely bring, discredit to her force, Mr Branston said there was an expectation she ""enforce the law and take action against members of the public who break them"". ""She chose to ignore the restrictions and undermined public confidence,"" Mr Branston said. PC Stephens told the hearing she accepted attending the house party, driving when unfit, and being convicted in court. She also acknowledged that taken together this behaviour amounted to gross misconduct. The case continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bodleian and Vatican digitise 1.5 million ancient texts,"The two libraries announced the four-year project after receiving a £2m award from the Polonsky Foundation. Dr Leonard Polonsky said his aim was to ensure researchers and the public have free access to historic and rare texts. Greek manuscripts, 15th Century printed books and Hebrew early printed books and manuscripts will be digitised. The three subjects were chosen ""for the strength of the collections in both libraries and their importance for scholarship in their respective fields"", a Bodleian spokeswoman said. The libraries say the digitisation will ""virtually unite"" materials that have been dispersed between the two collections over the past few centuries. Sarah Thomas, Bodley's librarian, said: ""Transforming these ancient texts and images into digital form helps transcend the limitations of time and space, which have in the past restricted access to knowledge. ""Scholars will be able to interrogate these documents in fresh approaches as a result of their online availability."" 'World's heritage' Two thirds of the material will come from the Vatican Library and the rest from the Bodleian. The University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries form the largest university library system in the UK and includes the famous principal library, the Bodleian. Founded by Thomas Bodley, it first opened to scholars in 1602 and its combined collections include more than 11 million printed items. A large number of its early printed books (incunabula) and Greek manuscripts originate from Italy and the project will focus on digitising these. The Vatican Library was founded in 1451 by Pope Nicholas V ""for the common convenience of the learned"". It is a private institution not attached to a university or academic institution. The Vatican Library preserves more than 180,000 manuscripts, 1,600,000 printed books, 300,000 coins and medals, and 150,000 prints, drawings and engravings. Many of the first books printed in Rome between 1467 and 1473 are still preserved in the Vatican Library, which also houses a copy of the entire Bible written about 1100 in Italy. The Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Lord Patten of Barnes, said: 'We are very grateful to Dr Polonsky for his insight into the importance of widening access to the fundamental texts which have had a major impact on the development of civilisation. ""By making these collections available online we give the wider public access to a small, but significant part of the world's heritage.'"" Monsignor Cesare Pasini, the prefect of the Vatican Library, said: ""Thanks to the far-sighted and generous support of the Polonsky Foundation, two of the oldest libraries in Europe will join forces in an innovative approach to digitisation driven by the actual needs of scholars and scholarship.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Liam Fox still in running for WTO chief as race narrows,"Three other contenders have been knocked out of the competition after failing to secure enough votes. It means five candidates remain in the race to be the next director-general. Mr Fox would be the first British boss of the organisation, which regulates the terms of international trade. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to Mr Fox, saying the WTO ""would be in excellent hands under his leadership"". He has also won the support of his ministerial successor. Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she was ""delighted"" Mr Fox remains in the race. ""The world needs a WTO director general that will stand up for free trade and fight protectionism. Business as usual will not work. We need someone with political skill who can build consensus, get things done, and drive forward the urgent reform that is needed. ""Liam is the ideal candidate for that,"" said Ms Truss. The three candidates who left the race are Mexico's Jesus Seade, Egypt's Hamid Mamdouh and Moldova's Tudor Ulianovschi. The remaining candidates to replace the current director-general, the Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, have to secure support from the WTO's 164 member states. The members have said they want to reach a consensus in November. The contest comes at a crucial time for the Geneva-based body, amid a slump in global trade in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Latest odds Mr Fox is still an outsider in the race to be the next WTO chief, according to the latest odds from Ladbrokes, which has him in fourth place at 10/1. The other remaining candidates are: 'Brexit prism' Mr Fox was the UK's international trade secretary under former prime minister Theresa May, when he was responsible for promoting UK trade post-Brexit. He was sacked when Mr Johnson entered Downing Street, having supported Mrs May's Brexit withdrawal deal, which Mr Johnson opposed. He has downplayed the importance of Brexit and did not mention it in his speech to the WTO's governing body in July. Asked whether ongoing trade talks between the UK and EU would prove an advantage or obstacle to his bid, he replied: ""Very fortunately, not everyone in the world sees every issue through the Brexit prism."" Speaking after his hearing, Mr Fox said the WTO needed an experienced politician - rather than a ""technocrat"" - to help it navigate ""what is a very difficult time"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What to expect from record year of privatisations,"By Anthony ReubenBusiness reporter, BBC News But analysis of House of Commons Library figures last week by the Press Association suggests it could be the biggest 12-month period we've had. In the financial year 2015-16, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reckons the government could raise about £32bn from selling public assets, the biggest chunk of which would be about £13bn from the sale of the government's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, followed closely by about £12bn from the sale of UK Asset Resolution, which owns the remaining bits of Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley. Other big price-tag sales include more of the government's stake in RBS, Royal Mail and the Student Loan book. PA adjusted previous years of privatisations to current money and found that 2015-16 would be the biggest year for privatisations by far. The previous high-water marks had been 1987 when chunks of BA, BAA, BP and Rolls-Royce raised about £22.7bn in today's money, and 1991 when the sale of parts of BT, National Power, PowerGen and regional electricity companies in Scotland raised about £22.6bn. Now, these figures are not perfect - for starters we are comparing a financial year, 2015-16, with previous calendar years. Also, IFS director Paul Johnson's recent review of inflation statistics warned against the use of RPI for anything whatsoever as a result of its statistical flaws. Even so, the difference between 2015-16 and any year since the start of the Thatcher era in 1979 is startling. The OBR suggests that we won't be seeing another year like it any time soon, predicting total proceeds of £32bn from the rest of the remaining four years of the parliament put together. But that figure is only made up of continuing sales of the RBS stake and the Student Loans book. The Conservatives' manifesto this year was very clear that the party planned to continue selling stakes in bailed-out banks and building societies and also that it would continue to sell unneeded government property. But there was no mention of any of the other rumoured sales such as the Royal Mint or the Met Office. The sale of the government's stake in Eurostar has been announced, but there are still difficulties in the sale of the stake in Urenco, which is a supplier of nuclear fuel. It's important to remember what the sale of public assets does for the public finances. It does not reduce the deficit, which is the amount the government needs to borrow in a year. It does reduce the country's overall debt, which also reduces the amount of interest that has to be paid each year.

A university is continuing to fund this summer's programme but there has been criticism that wider bird research in its place will be less comprehensive. NRW said it had to take ""tough decisions"" but all the island's environment would be monitored. Skomer, off the Pembrokeshire coast, is popular with 250 visitors a day in the summer season, with a chance to spot razorbills, guillemots and puffins. But there are fewer of them this year as the bird population was affected by the winter storms. Prof Tim Birkhead, a zoologist at Sheffield University, has been monitoring guillemots on the south of Skomer for 40 years. ""Guillemots are one of Britain's most abundant seabirds but they have been through changing times,"" he says. ""On Skomer in the 1930s there were thought to be around 100,000 pairs here but now there are around 25,000. ""But they are still very vulnerable to oiling incidents or in the case of this spring to climate change. ""With the storms last winter, we know there was massive mortality - 40,000 dead seabirds were picked up, around half of those guillemots. 'Government cutbacks' ""We know a lot of our birds died, as we had three times more recoveries from Skomer-ringed birds than over the last 40 years."" Other seabirds are monitored too, but not with the same detail as those given to guillemots. Prof Birkhead said: ""We monitor the survival rate of adults, how many young birds survive to breed, how old they are when they breed and the food supply the chicks are fed when growing up."" He is worried that a more broad-brush approach to research will not bring the detailed results which can tell conservationists how well the birds are recovering. ""This is too important to do in some sloppy, tick-box sort of way - it has to be professional and crucially overseen by someone with scientific knowledge. ""There's absolutely no point doing it if it's done wrong."" Mike Evans of NRW has defended the cutbacks. ""At a time of government cutbacks we have to take some very tough decisions,"" he says. ""What we've tried to do with our monitoring on Skomer is to make sure we're doing every element of the environment that we can rather than concentrating on a single species. ""We're continuing to monitor 12 species of birds which are very special to the island but we're also looking at the underwater environment and have a big programme of monitoring to make sure the sea is in a good state to support the bird population.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Meet Jordan, the beauty blogger who is also paralysed from the chest down","By Annabel RackhamNewsbeat reporter A car accident when she was 15 left her quadriplegic and reliant on a wheelchair to get around. She suffered from depression after the accident, so started making videos that she hoped would will help others. ""I still deserve an amazing life and so does everyone else who has a similar injury,"" Jordan told Newsbeat. ""When I first had my accident I didn't really know where my life would take me. ""I became depressed a couple of years after my accident because I realised my life wouldn't be the way I intended it to be. ""I came across guided meditations on YouTube and they changed my perception of the world and how I thought about myself."" Jordan regularly updates her Instagram with beauty and fashion posts. The 27-year-old from Norfolk initially started posting positivity videos on YouTube, but people commented on her videos asking about her make-up looks and that inspired her to try beauty vlogging. ""I re-taught myself make-up during the time in hospital, not very well, but I kept trying and persevering and eventually I got good enough to start showing the world through YouTube tutorials,"" she said. Her most popular video deals with her limited mobility - it's had more than 17 million views on Facebook and five million on YouTube. Jordan's video on YouTube. Warning: Third party content, may contain adverts ""I made the video because a lot of people were asking constantly, 'What's wrong with her hands, why is she holding the brush that way?' ""At the same time I wanted to inspire people to realise that their struggles aren't the end of the world and people can still achieve great things."" Jordan has gone further with her positivity mission and has recently released a book called My Beautiful Struggle, which sold out online during its first day on sale. ""I just hope this reaches so many people because I believe my story could inspire someone, just because I felt at my wit's end and that I could never do anything ever again,"" she says. ""I thought, who would hire me if I ever wanted a job, what could I physically do myself and I felt like giving up."" ""I talk about how it's OK not to be OK and how we should talk about our feelings and it's important to acknowledge our emotions,"" Jordan says. Jordan's book is a bestseller on Amazon.

Environment Agency abandons sell-off of dredging equipment,"Three long-reach excavators, capable of removing earth and debris from underwater, were due to be auctioned by Brightwells, near Hereford, on Friday. Three other lots featuring non-dredging equipment were left in the sale. The agency said it had withdrawn the items from auction because of the present floods. The planned sale had attracted strong criticism from some farmers. John Bishop, whose farm in Colwall, Herefordshire has been affected by flooding said the timing of the planned sell-off was ""very undiplomatic putting it mildly"". 'National reserve' Jeremy Perkins, who runs a livestock farm in Suffolk and is an online moderator for The Farming Forum, went further. ""The timing couldn't be worse, but it should never have been put for sale at all,"" he said. ""There should be a national reserve of this kit, either to allow it to be used for preventative measures, or for use in an emergency."" The Environment Agency said the three excavators would now be reconditioned and put back into service. A statement on the auctioneers' website read: ""We are instructed to withdraw lots 649, 650 and 651, on behalf of the seller. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."" A spokesman for the Environment Agency admitted Friday's auction was ""not great timing"" and a decision to withdraw the items was taken ""very recently"". However, he said selling off equipment was all part of managing a working fleet and designed to recoup some of the cost for taxpayers. He said the excavators due to be sold in Herefordshire were eight years old and being replaced. Mr Perkins likened selling off an excavator of this age as selling a car that's done 30,000 miles, adding that it had ""plenty of miles left in it"". He said there had been a huge response to the intended sale on The Farming Forum. One post said the sell-off was a good indication of the amount of dredging the agency intended to carry out in Somerset. Another said ""have they no shame?"". The agency said it had invested in 10 new and improved models of long-reach excavators over the last three months. It is not the first time the Environment Agency has auctioned off dredging machinery. In December, a long-reach excavator, almost identical to those slated for auction on Friday, was sold for £47,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
HMP Birmingham: Funding dispute stopped CCTV installation,"HMP Birmingham used to be run by security firm G4S but was taken back into government control this year. CCTV has never been fitted on wings because both G4S and the Prison Service felt the other should fund it, the Independent Monitoring Board said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said CCTV would be installed within six weeks. G4S took on the running of the category B prison, which houses just under 1,000 inmates, in 2011. It lost the contract in April after the chief inspector of prisons described the jail last year as the worst he had ever been to, two years after a huge riot. A new governor was appointed and the board's latest annual report published on Thursday said a ""reduced prison population and the much-needed capital investment"" since had enabled the prison to start making improvements. Highlighting the lack of CCTV cameras for so many years, the report said ""given the prison had the highest level of staff assaults and prisoner violence in previous years in England and Wales, the failure of the two parties to settle the funding of CCTV deserves criticism"". The delay in installing a body scanner in reception, promised last year, was also criticised. The jail's failure to secure funding for the scanner was ""inexplicable"", the chief inspector of prisons said earlier this year. The MoJ said it would now be fully operational in the new year. However, 14 mobile phones, 133g of tobacco and 14g of cannabis hidden in two pairs of trainers were among items found on visitors by new dedicated search teams over the past year, the report added. Other findings by the IMB: You may also be interested in: A drop in violence and self-harm had also now made the prison one of the best performing compared with jails of a similar category and population, monitors said. Conditions had also improved and it was now ""unusual"" to find men in ""uninhabitable"" cells with leaking pipework or toilets, the report said. Roger Swindells, chair of the board said: ""Looking ahead, there are clear, encouraging signs of further progress and evidence that HMP Birmingham is working hard to become a more decent and respectful place for all who live and work there, with the intention of ensuring that prisoners are better prepared for release."" The MoJ said violence was down by two-thirds this year and it welcomed the fact the ""tireless"" work by staff was being recognised. ""The prison will benefit from our £100m investment in new security measures like body scanners, part of an additional £2.75bn that will be spent on our jails,"" it said.

Derry-Londonderry-Doire clipper arrives in River Foyle,"By Dean McLaughlinBBC News NI Thousands of people lined the quay from 10:00 BST on Monday to welcome the crew, who won the home leg of the race. The crew left Greencastle in County Donegal at 08:00 BST and arrived at the Foyle marina at 11:00 BST. Fireworks and cheers welcomed the crew to Derry for the penultimate stopover on the world's longest ocean race. A nine-day maritime festival began in Derry on Saturday. The Red Arrows will fly over Lough Foyle on 29 June to close the festival. The 2,800-mile leg from New York to Derry was the 14th stage in the 16-series race. Proud The win puts the crew in fourth place and in contention to challenge for the third spot on the podium. Sean McCarter, from Derry, is one of the skippers on the Derry-Londonderry-Doire yacht. ""I couldn't be any prouder of how this team has performed,"" said Mr McCarter. ""We have always said this is our race and there was no way we were going to let anyone else stand on that podium in Derry ahead of us. ""We've waited a long time for this moment and we can't wait to celebrate with everyone. ""It's so nice to be home. There were a lot of tears. ""You find different motivations for each race but the past week was definitely about coming home to Derry in first position. ""There were difficult times out at sea and it was intense but it's an amazing experience. ""I'm looking forward to putting my feet up for a while and not having to worry about weather reports."" Mayor of Derry, Brenda Stevenson, said: ""It is a fantastic achievement for everyone involved. ""We are extremely proud of Sean McCarter and his team. ""Derry has been put on the map once again and this will create a fantastic financial and tourism boost. ""The Legenderry maritime festival has already been a huge success to date attracting thousands of families over the weekend."" Organisers have said the race will come back to Londonderry in 2016. Sir Robin Knox Johnston, founder of the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, said: ""The enthusiasm in Derry is fantastic. ""The amount of people coming out to see the yachts is unbelievable. ""Sean McCarter was a great leader on the clipper. ""When Andrew Taylor went overboard, Sean reacted very very well."" 'Best welcome' Andrew Taylor, from London, went over the side of the Derry-Londonderry-Doire yacht in March and was rescued almost two hours later. ""It's a pleasure to be in Derry,"" said Mr Taylor. ""What a welcome we got. It was pretty special. It really was the best welcome. ""Everyday is a bonus for me now ever since I went overboard. ""I did think it was all over at one stage.

Irish rivals Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil agree plan for government,"Leo Varadkar and Mícheál Martin will put the deal before both parliamentary parties on Wednesday afternoon. Their negotiators agreed the deal on Friday. It is the first time the two parties that have roots in the Irish Civil War almost a century ago have reached an accord to share power in government. Securing a majority If, as expected, party members endorse it, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will then present it to the Greens, Labour, the Social Democrats, and some independent TDs (members of the Irish parliament) in the hope of getting enough votes to get a Dáil (lower house) majority. The two parties are eight votes short of a majority and have in the past said they would like at least one other party and some independents to sign up for a government that would last at least four years. To date the other political parties have been reluctant to do so, while both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael refuse to do a deal with Sinn Féin. Fianna Fáil was the largest party in terms of seats following the general election in February, but it and Sinn Féin now have the same number of seats after a Fianna Fáil TD was elected speaker. Sinn Féin won the most first preference votes, with Fine Gael the third-biggest party. Negotiations have been ongoing since the election. BBC News NI Dublin Correspondent Shane Harrison said it was expected Mr Martin would take over from Mr Varadkar as taoiseach (Irish prime minister) because his party won more seats. Opposition It is known the deal is not very specific on policy but prioritises dealing with Covid-19 and its economic consequences. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael hope the deal will gain enough acceptance to indicate there will be a Dáil majority for it. It will then have to be endorsed by an extraordinary Fine Gael party conference and a Fianna Fáil ard fheis (conference). Eamonn Ó’Cuív, a grandson of Fianna Fáil’s founder, Eamonn de Valera, has already indicated his opposition. The aim is to get a government formed on 23 April at a planned Dáil session in the National Convention Centre, a building that will allow all 160 TDs to assemble and observe social distancing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pope Francis shuns grand apartment for two rooms,"His spokesman said he was ""trying out this type of simple living"" in a communal building with other priests. In doing so he has broken a tradition which is more than a century old. The decision reinforces the newly-elected Pope's austere reputation. As archbishop of Buenos Aires he refused to move into the Bishop's Palace. Preferring more modest accommodation, he also often cooked his own meals. Communal meals Since the reign of Pope Pius X at the beginning of the 20th Century every pope has occupied the palatial penthouse apartment with more than a dozen rooms, staff quarters, a terrace and extensive views over the city of Rome. But since his election Pope Francis has been living in a simple two-room suite in the Domus Santa Marta - a hotel-style residence built by Pope John Paul II next to St Peter's Basilica. And he intends to go on living there for the foreseeable future, according to the Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi. ""This morning he let his fellow cardinals know that he will keep living with them for a certain period of time,"" Fr Lombardi said. He said he could not say whether the Pope would remain in these quarters in the long term. ""It is still a period of getting used to things,"" Fr Lombardi added. Pope Francis will continue to use the papal library on the second floor of the Apostolic palace for receiving official guests and will appear on Sundays at the window used by previous popes to address pilgrims in St Peters Square. About half the 105 suites in the residence are occupied by Vatican staff, who had to move out of their rooms to accommodate visiting cardinals during the holding of the recent conclave at which Pope Francis was elected. The Pope will take his meals in the communal dining room together with other visiting clerics and permanent residents. His simple new communal home contrasts with the much larger accommodation currently being renovated inside the Vatican for the future use of the now retired former Pope Benedict and his staff, reports the BBC's David Willey in Rome.

Bluebird's electric car record hit by beach 'pothole',"Joe Wales veered off course and Bluebird Electric was damaged at Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire. Mr Wales, 19, suffered mild whiplash in the attempt to break the 137mph record held by his father Don. His great-grandfather Sir Malcolm and great uncle Donald Campbell have held world speed records on land and water. He had been joined by his father Don Wales, 50, from Addlestone, Surrey, who was attempting to break his own record, set in 2000. The record bid for the weekend was aborted after the car's suspension was damaged, says BBC Wales reporter Sarah Moore. The team said they were ""disappointed but relieved Joe was OK"" after the accident, when the car veered off course into unprepared sand and the right front wheel upright sheered off - causing the suspension to fail. Mr Wales, who spoke after being checked over, said he was ""gutted"" and was disappointed for the crowd of several hundred, who turned up to watch. Pendine is the scene of notable speed record attempts over the decades, including Malcolm Campbell in 1924. For the electric car attempt, Don Wales was optimistic he could exceed 150mph despite hitting technical problems on Saturday. Before the attempt he said: ""I think we've got to be confident. The guys behind us have worked so hard for the last six weeks or so - the mechanical team and the electrical team from Bristol University - so I've got to put my faith in them because they've done all the hard work up to now. ""Then it's up to me to drive the car and get it above 150."" Sir Malcolm Campbell himself set a record in a combustion engine on the same beach, Pendine Sands, with a speed of 146mph in 1924. His son and Mr Wales' uncle, Donald Campbell, took the water speed record to 152 mph in 1950, but died in a further attempt in 1967. Earlier this week, Mr Wales said: ""Ten years ago we set a UK record of 137mph at Pendine Sands and we are going back there this weekend to hopefully increase that speed to somewhere around 150mph or 160mph. ""This really is the start of a two or three-year campaign with a target of 500mph."" The Bluebird team, which includes mechanics from Nelson in Lancashire, plans to test the super-fast car's technology this weekend and then to build a new electric vehicle for a further world record attempt. They are hoping to eventually hit 500mph and pass the 307mph record set by the American Buckeye Bullet 2.5 team last year. Mr Wales's son Joe Wales, 19, will also drive Bluebird to attempt the quarter-mile and 500-metre UK speed records. ""I am very proud to be representing my family and their heritage. Hopefully, this is the start of a world-record car.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Strule campus will not open 'until at least 2025',"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The new date was revealed in the Department of Education's (DE) just-published annual report. The Strule Shared Education Campus had originally been due to open in 2020, but has been delayed a number of times. Arvalee Special School, which opened in 2016, is the only one of six schools to be built so far. The estimated cost of the project has also risen substantially to £213m. The Strule campus is the biggest school building project in Northern Ireland. It will mean six schools and more than 4,000 pupils moving to the site of the former Lisanelly army base. Loreto Grammar School, Omagh High School, Sacred Heart College, Omagh Academy and Christian Brothers Grammar School are set to get new buildings on the campus alongside Arvalee School. Work began on the site in 2013. Earlier this year, DE said that the provisional opening date for the campus was now September 2024. However the department has now pushed that back a further year until 2025, according to its annual report. The report said that date was also still dependent on approval of an addendum to the business case and final confirmation that funding from the Fresh Start Agreement - signed in November 2015 - can be used to pay for the campus. Under that agreement, £50m a year for 10 years was to be provided for integrated school buildings and shared education campuses. ""A significant amount of work has gone into updating the programme business case options, cost estimates, benefits, risks and re-confirming the overall value for money,"" the DE report said. ""A second addendum to the Strule business case has been developed and is currently awaiting approvals. ""Due to the ongoing procurement/business case delay and more recently the impact of Covid-19 on government business, there has been some slippage to completion dates with current estimates predicting the remaining schools will be on campus for September 2025 at the earliest."" The annual report also said that the process to find a contractor for the work is still suspended, but the department was working to ""identify a solution"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Robbie Coltrane 'appalled' by historical sex abuse,"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter The actor plays a fictional celebrity who is accused of historical sex crimes in Channel 4 drama National Treasure, which begins later this month. Referring to real-life revelations, he said: ""Every day another story [comes out], and I think it appals all of us."" He said he believed appearing in the series was ""an important thing to do"". ""The power of drama is you can deal with these things in a way that the judiciary, the police and Parliament can't, or seem unable to."" The actor said he had avoided meeting Jimmy Savile, who was found to be a serial abuser who had preyed on children and adults over several decades. ""I never wanted to meet him. I always thought he was creepy,"" Coltrane said. ""The big question is, what kind of culture was going on that he got away with it for as long as he did?"" At least 72 people were sexually abused by Savile in connection with his work at the BBC, and the corporation missed opportunities to stop his abuse because of a ""culture of fear"", the Dame Janet Smith review concluded earlier this year. Coltrane said he hoped advances in communication and technology meant similar abuse would be less likely to occur now. ""With the way electronics and social media [are], hopefully it won't happen again, that you could not get away with it these days. That's what you'd hope,"" he said. Asked whether it was a difficult decision to appear in the show, Coltrane said: ""Not once I read the script."" The four-part drama's screenplay was written by Jack Thorne, who also wrote Harry Potter and The Cursed Child, which is currently playing in London's West End. Co-star Julie Walters agreed that National Treasure ""was wonderfully written, and written in a complicated, multifaceted way"". The actress plays the wife of Coltrane's character, one of many people around him whose lives are torn apart by the allegations. ""You look at these cases and for me it's the wife you want to know about,"" Walters said. ""Women like that are fascinating. The reasons she stands by him were fascinating to go into.""

"Donald Trump 'unaware UK was nuclear power', says former aide","The US President is alleged to have made the comments about British military capability at a meeting with former PM Theresa May two years ago. Mr Bolton, who worked in the White House for 17 months, said the president was ""stunningly uninformed"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab declined to comment on the claim on Thursday. Mr Bolton's 577-page tome, The Room Where It Happened, is due to go on sale next week - but the Trump administration is trying to block its publication. In a tweet, the president described the book as ""made up of lies and fake stories"". According to one excerpt, the UK's nuclear arsenal came up during a meeting with Mrs May in 2018, when it was mentioned by one of the then-prime minister's officials. According to the book, Mr Trump said: ""Oh, are you a nuclear power?"" Mr Bolton said he could tell it ""was not intended as a joke"". Mr Bolton left the White House in September 2019, saying he had quit as national security adviser. Mr Trump however said he had fired Mr Bolton because he disagreed ""strongly"" with him. Nine countries currently have nuclear weapons: the US, UK, Russia, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. UK nuclear history The UK developed and tested its own nuclear weapons in the early 1950s, at a time when the US government did not share the technology with its wartime ally. The UK's nuclear bombs were initially carried by the RAF's V-force but the government later purchased the submarine-based Polaris missile system from the US, which became one of the cornerstones of NATO's cold war defences. The current submarine-based system - known as Trident - was launched in the 1990s, after Margaret Thatcher decided to replace Polaris in 1980. It is named after the Trident missiles they carry, which are serviced at a port in the US. Some warhead components are also made in America. Nuclear links British governments have always stressed Trident's independence, saying its firing does not require the permission, the satellites or the codes of the US. But critics argue the UK is technically so dependent on the US that in effect Trident is not an independent system. Asked about the reports of the book on Thursday, Mr Raab said he did not want to get ""dragged into the commentary"" on its publication. ""Trying to get me to comment on books from a former member of the administration is not my focus,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I don't know the answer to it,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Drive on demand' car-sharing scheme reaches Birmingham,"Members of the car2go scheme will be charged 35p per minute to rent one of the Smart cars which can be picked up from legal on-street parking spaces, a spokesman said. Drivers can locate the nearest vehicle via the company's website or a smartphone app. Birmingham City Council said the project will run for 12 months. 'Easy on the pocket' Set up by Daimler and Europcar, it has already been launched in three boroughs Islington in London and runs in 18 other cities in Europe and the US, the firms said. A council spokesman said the idea of being able to spontaneously rent the cars without having to use fixed rental stations would encourage people to think of alternatives to bringing their cars into the city. ""They can be used as long as needed and then left in a pay & display bay without time restrictions and wherever it is free to park without affecting resident or business parking within a defined business area,"" he said. ""It's a whole new way of getting around the city, easy to use, easy on the pocket and easy on the environment."" The project covers about a 50 sq-km (20sq-m) area. Roy Wilcox, from car2go, said they wanted to launch the scheme across an entire city and Birmingham seemed the most suitable. ""It's the biggest city council in England and we wanted a whole city launch and after London, it was a natural choice,"" he said. ""The pre take-up here has been massive, we're very happy with that. ""The cars are the lowest CO2 cars you can get, they're nippy and fun. ""The time is right for this - as petrol prices and insurance goes up and peoples' salaries aren't really going up, people are looking to shave their budgets and help the environment."" Julien Pritchard, from Friends of the Earth, said he would be looking to see if it detracts from people using bikes. ""It depends how they use them and who is using them but they could be really positive."" he said. ""They have lower emissions than most cars and the way people can pick them up is good. ""But, if it takes people away from bikes, public transport and walking then that's not so good."" Esther Perry, who drives from her home in Wolverhampton to where she works in Birmingham, said she had not considered joining the scheme. ""I don't think I need to use it really because I already drive in, but I can see how it would appeal to people to get around the city centre if you didn't know the bus number you needed perhaps. ""It would be good for people who live here and need to nip around.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Long Covid: More than a million affected in February, survey suggests","By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter It estimates that 1.1 million people were affected in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. About 20% of people said ongoing symptoms limited their day-to-day activities a lot. People were asked to report their own symptoms. The ONS survey asked people if they faced issues such as fatigue lasting more than four weeks after a Covid infection that could not be explained by anything else. The most common ongoing problems included fatigue, coughs, headaches and muscle pain. A separate ONS study estimates coronavirus infections fell slightly in England and Scotland, rose in Northern Ireland and stayed roughly the same in Wales in the week to 27 March. Despite a slight uptick in infections in children of secondary school age in the week to 20 March, there was no indication of that trend continuing in the latest figures. Among people aged 50-69, the study suggests a decrease in the percentage testing positive, which may be a result of this age group being offered vaccinations against Covid-19 in recent weeks. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid, but it covers a broad range of symptoms. Meanwhile, in the latest daily figures, the government said that a further 4,479 people had tested positive for coronavirus and another 51 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Although that latter figure is slightly up on the previous day, it is lower than the 63 announced last Thursday. And after Tuesday saw more second vaccinations than first jabs, that accelerated dramatically in Wednesday figures that have just been released. While there were 241,906 making their first trip to the vaccine clinic, there were 404,922 getting their follow-up dose. 'Emerging phenomenon' The survey of UK households found: Long Covid is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood, and the estimates from the ONS are preliminary. Most people who get coronavirus feel better in a few days or weeks, and the majority will make a full recovery within 12 weeks. But for some people, symptoms can last longer. People who had mild symptoms at first can still have long-term problems. NHS England has invested £10m in specialist long Covid clinics. Health officials say anyone who is worried about symptoms a month after getting the virus should speak to their GP. What has been your experience of the pandemic? Have you had Long Covid?

Juventus shares drop after Ronaldo rape allegation,"He strongly denies the allegation which emerged in German media this week. The club's share prices had hit record levels after Ronaldo joined in July. But they have dipped since the allegation emerged against him on Tuesday - losing almost 10% of their value on Friday alone. The club's social media accounts have been criticised for tweets they posted on Thursday. In them they said the alleged events ""dating back to almost 10 years ago"" do not change their opinion of the player, who they described as a ""great champion"". They then shared a video of him with the caption: ""Juventus go for goal. Cristiano Ronaldo finds the target!"" Former England international and football pundit Gary Lineker described the series of posts as ""awful"". Other users labelled the posts ""abhorrent"" and called for them to apologise, while other replies defended the posts. What is Ronaldo accused of? Kathryn Mayorga, a teacher from Nevada, came forward in German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday with an allegation against the Portugal international. The 34-year-old alleges Ronaldo raped her in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009 shortly after they met in a nightclub. Her lawyers are seeking to void an apparent 2010 non-disclosure agreement she reportedly signed as part of an out-of-court $375,000 (£288,000) financial settlement with the player. But the footballer ""firmly"" denies the allegation and has dismissed the article as ""fake news"". His lawyers also say they plan to sue the German publication. Police in Las Vegas have said they have reopened their investigation into the alleged assault. They said at the time of original reporting the victim did not provide police with the location of the incident or a suspect description. What has the reaction been? Ronaldo has been left out of Portugal's squad for games against Scotland and Poland, but Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said on Friday he was ""ready to return to action"" in a Serie A match against Udinese on Saturday. The Italian side signed Ronaldo from Real Madrid for 112m euro (£99m; $130) in July - a move which helped the club's share price soar 180% to a peak of more than 1.80 euro a share in September. By close of markets on Friday they had dropped to 1.19 euro following a 9.92% drop on Friday alone. It comes after both EA Sports and Nike, who have lucrative sponsorship deals with Ronaldo, both said they were monitoring the situation closely. Nike, whose contract with the player is worth a reported $1bn (£768m), said on Thursday they were ""deeply concerned"" by the ""disturbing allegations"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dutch police give 'stop paedophile hunts' warning after Arnhem death,"Oscar Dros said there was a risk more people could die and he appealed for justice to be left to the authorities. The man from the eastern city of Arnhem was lured into having sexual contact with a minor while in a gay chatroom. Authorities said he was aware the boy was underage. But there was no evidence of past sexual contact with minors. The Arnhem attack is the latest in a series of 250 incidents involving so-called ""paedophile hunters"" in the Netherlands, reports say. What happened in Arnhem Reports say the group of teenagers had come up with the idea of hunting for a paedophile after reading stories elsewhere in the Netherlands. The former teacher arrived at an agreed meeting point on 28 October and was then followed as he made his way home. He was beaten up by a group of boys and died later in hospital. Mayor Ahmed Marcouch has spoken of an ""awful crime"" that has had an impact on the local community. Dozens of neighbours, friends and former pupils took part in a ceremony to remember the victim last weekend. The fifteen-year-old's lawyer told local website De Gelderlander that the idea of hunting paedophiles ""happened out of boredom in this corona time"". His client had got carried away but did not himself take part in the attack. Jamil Roethof argued that the teenagers had only wished to confront the man and had no premeditated plan to attack him. He suggested he had died of a fall. Seven teenagers were arrested, six of them under the age of 18, and two have been held in custody. What do police say? East Netherlands regional police chief Oscar Dros appealed to Dutch citizens to ""stop paedo-hunting; stop detaining; stop provoking - leave this to us."" Mr Dros told Algemeen Dagblad newspaper that since July some 250 incidents had been registered involving self-styled hunters, and there were probably many more. The practice has now been banned by police and public prosecutors. People had been forced off the road, assaulted, threatened and publicly shamed on the internet, he said. Facebook groups have sprung up across the country, with names like pedohuntnl, and some have attracted thousands of members. One group member told public broadcaster NOS that ""we're doing this to protect children"". Minutes after going into a chatroom, he claimed, five or six men would try to meet up with you, knowing full well you were a minor. ""That's just not right."" Similar groups have appeared in the UK, prompting one assistant chief constable to say the overall activity of such groups was ""not positive"". The Dutch police chief said such vigilante behaviour ""has no effect, because the evidence these citizens believe they have is often paper thin"". He knew of not one example that had led to a paedophile being convicted.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
George 'Grumpy' Unwin: A life celebrated in Duxford exhibition,"So said Wing Commander George ""Grumpy"" Unwin, a World War II Battle of Britain fighter pilot whose personal story is featured in a new exhibition about the men and women who lived, worked and fought for their country at RAF Duxford in Cambridgeshire from 1918 to 1961. He became one of the most famous of ""The Few"", as the pilots were named by the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He flew with No. 19 Squadron, and during his time as a pilot was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM) and Bar. The son of a miner, George Unwin was born in 1913 in Bolton-on-Dearne, Yorkshire. He joined the RAF as a clerk at the age of 16, volunteered to be a pilot in 1935 and flew fighters from Duxford a year later. Legend has it he was given the nickname ""Grumpy"" by fighter ace Douglas Bader, who was based at Duxford for a time. The story goes that Douglas Bader was noisily adjusting his artificial legs late one night when Mr Unwin told him to be quiet. ""Shut up, Grumpy,"" Bader replied, and the name stuck. However, another story tells he earned the nickname after repeatedly complaining about not being allocated an aircraft during the Dunkirk crisis. George Unwin and his Alsatian Flash were a familiar sight around the airfield and appear in many archive photographs. He said he could be a bit of a rebel at times. ""I personally used to break the law every Friday evening. ""I used to take my fitter and my rigger... down to the local pub and buy them a couple of pints of beer every Friday evening. ""There was no question of lack of discipline, but that was my kind of thanks."" George Unwin flew out of Duxford on many sorties for the Battle of Britain and was credited with 14 enemy aircraft shot down by the end of 1940. He was awarded the DFM that October with a bar award in December. At the end of the year Mr Unwin was sent to train as an instructor to the flying school at Cranwell. After the war he remained in the RAF and flew during the Malaya conflict in 1952 and was awarded the DSO for his efforts. He retired from the RAF in 1961 as a Wing Commander. George ""Grumpy"" Unwin died in June 2006 at the age of 93. Mr Unwin's medals feature in the Historic Duxford exhibition, and he can be seen on some of the film screens talking about his life at RAF Duxford. The exhibition, which opened on Thursday, is the first permanent exhibition at Imperial War Museum Duxford since the opening of AirSpace in 2007, which told the story of British aviation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Three charged over Tesco accounts fraud,"Carl Rogberg, Christopher Bush and John Scouler have been charged with fraud and false accounting, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said. The three are due to appear in court on 22 September. Tesco said there had been ""an extensive programme of change"" since 2014. Mr Bush was managing director of Tesco UK, Mr Rogberg was UK finance director and Mr Scouler was UK food commercial director. Mr Bush's solicitor said that he was not guilty and planned to fight the allegations. The SFO started a criminal investigation in October 2014, a week after Tesco announced that its profits had been overstated by £263m. Later, that figure was revised upwards to £326m when Tesco included previous accounts. Action Auditors found that the inflated profit figure was the result of Tesco booking payments from suppliers before the company had been due the money. The affair damaged the company's share price and led to court action by US shareholders. In November last year, Tesco paid $12m (£9m) to settle a lawsuit alleging that accounting irregularities had inflated the share price of the company. The company was also being investigated by the UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which polices accountants. The regulator has since closed its investigation into Laurie McIlwee, the former chief financial officer at Tesco. The FRC, however, is still investigating Tesco's accountants PwC as to how the firm audited its accounts in the run up to the scandal. 'Historic issues' Tesco said in a statement: ""We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation into the company is ongoing. ""Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO's investigation. The last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time."" Mr Scouler is now commercial director at the telecoms company TalkTalk. In a statement Talk Talk said: ""We are aware of the SFO's announcement, but as this is an ongoing investigation unrelated to TalkTalk we cannot comment further."" Sarah Wallace, head of the regulatory and criminal Investigation team for the law firm, Irwin Mitchell, said: ""The role of the SFO is to investigate and sometimes prosecute allegations of serious fraud and financial crime. ""In recent years, the SFO focussed on investigating well-known, high-profile, global companies. I don't know what the outcome of this investigation involving Tesco will be. but Tesco's is a household name that we all know.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
East Midlands Ambulance Service misses care targets,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found problems including the care and welfare of patients, safety and suitability of equipment and staffing levels. On one occasion an ambulance had to be jump-started by a patient's family using their own car, inspectors heard. The service said it was improving under new management and investing in vital areas. In May 2013, the service was fined £3.5m for missing response time targets for a third successive year. It was one of only two of England's 10 ambulance trusts to fail to get an ambulance to 95% of all life-threatening emergencies within 19 minutes. The (CQC) carried out the unannounced inspection in January. It found there were not enough vehicles or experienced staff, and many complained of being overworked with new recruitment not keeping pace with demands. Staff told inspectors they did not always have access to equipment they needed and availability of vehicles was a ""big issue"". One worker said roadworthiness checks were sometimes missed due to time pressures and once an ambulance battery went flat, requiring the patient's family to jump-start the vehicle. Another said: ""We need more resources, more staff. There is nothing more frustrating than holding on to a call. ""At the end of the day we have targets, but they are people waiting for an ambulance."" Improvements being made Richard Henderson, the trust's director of operations, said: ""We have plans in place to address each of these areas."" He said the trust had 110 more frontline staff than a year ago and planned to increase staffing further. ""Alongside that, we have plans in place to address the vehicle and equipment issues and we are confident we do have the correct number of vehicles and equipment across the trust,"" he said. Inspectors said there had been improvements since their last visit. Standards of infection control were being met and a good complaints system was in place. Concerns about response times are being dealt with by the Trust Development Authority, which oversees the service. New interim chief executive of the trust, Sue Noyes, began in October and said meeting targets was a priority.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Trains, buses, ferries and trams face service cuts","Rail services in Scotland will move to a reduced timetable from Monday, while bus operator McGill's will introduce ""emergency"" timetables on the same day. Edinburgh Trams will bring in a reduced service from Sunday. Meanwhile, ferry operator Calmac said it had stopped taking new bookings on all of its services up to 15 July. The moves came as Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said Scotland was reaching a point where services would be reduced to essential journeys only. The reduction in ScotRail services will be similar to a Sunday service, with some additional early and late trains for key staff. The rail operator said the changes would ensure there were ""more than enough seats to meet current demand levels"". It added that the new arrangements would be ""kept under regular review"". In a statement published on its website, ScotRail said rail workers were ""working flat out to provide transport for people delivering essential services"". It said staffing levels at ScotRail and Network Rail Scotland had been affected by the ""unprecedented global crisis"", as well as customer demand. McGill's, which operates more than 110 bus routes throughout the west of Scotland, said ""almost all services"" would continue to operate from Monday, most at half of their normal frequency. It added: ""Precautions have been taken to ensure all journeys are still possible at this time."" The company has published the revised timetables on its website. Edinburgh Trams reported that from Sunday, it would run a reduced service between Edinburgh Airport and York Place, with trams every 15 minutes. In a statement, Edinburgh Trams said: ""Due to the current government guidelines surrounding the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus) and the use of public transport we have seen a reduction in customer demand. ""We have decided to tailor the service to the needs of the customer, while taking into account the availability of staff."" Updates on services can be found on the tram operator's Twitter page, the Transport for Edinburgh app and at edinburghtrams.com Meanwhile, CalMac has stopped taking new bookings on all of its services up to and including 15 July. The ferry operator said bookings that had already been made up to that period would be ""honoured where services are running"", adding that it would now be operating a ""turn up and go"" service on all of its routes. CalMac has also stopped serving hot food on board ""to free up our staff to crew our vessels"". Managing director Robbie Drummond said: ""Whilst we are currently able to continue operating our normal timetabled service, we have to plan for the impact of the virus on our staff at ports, on vessels and within our support services.

"Greensill: Nonsense to claim Greensill was desperate, says David Cameron","The ex-PM said it was ""nonsense"" to say the firm had been ""in difficulty"" when he lobbied on its behalf. Greensill had not requested ""direct support in any way"", he added. But Labour said the company, which later collapsed, had been ""desperate for access to taxpayer money"". Mr Cameron has come in for severe criticism for the work he carried out for Greensill after it took him on as an adviser in 2018. It has been revealed that he texted Chancellor Rishi Sunak and top Treasury official Sir Tom Scholar early last year over access to government-backed loans for businesses suffering in the pandemic. On Thursday, the Treasury released 40 pages of messages relating to its contact with Mr Cameron and Greensill. And the Bank of England has said Mr Cameron contacted it multiple times. In June last year, Greensill was accredited as a lender to ""midsized and larger"" firms under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS). For Labour, shadow chancellor Annaliese Dodds said: ""We need to follow the money. Greensill was carrying the begging bowl from the Bank of England to the Treasury and back. ""It was desperate for access to taxpayer money, and the government granted that access by accrediting it to the CLBILS scheme in June [2020]."" She added that Mr Sunak and the Treasury had done ""nothing when they were aware Greensill was deep in the red three months earlier"". Mr Cameron lobbied for the terms of the separate Covid Corporate Financing Facility scheme to be changed so that Greensill could take part, which was rejected. Mr Cameron's spokesman said the company had not been ""asking for a government loan or direct support in any way"". ""The Treasury letter rejecting the proposals in June makes clear that Greensill reported that market conditions were improving,"" he added. ""So the idea that Greensill was in difficulty at that stage is nonsense."" Speaking in a visit to Hartlepool, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Cameron had lobbied ""anybody who'll reply to him"". He added that it ""wasn't just David Cameron"" and that it was ""increasingly obvious"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""been involved in this action"". Three MP-led inquiries and a lawyer-led government review are looking at Mr Cameron's work for Greensill, which fell into administration in March this year, with the loss of 440 jobs. The former Conservative leader, who started working for the company as an adviser two years after leaving Downing Street, has insisted he broke no lobbying rules but accepted he should have contacted ministers using more formal channels.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The Princess and the Poitín,"By Nuala McCannBBC News Not that she took a drop of it... but when young policemen offer one a present of a bottle of poitín (illegally brewed Irish spirits), is it rude for one to refuse? The young recruits wanted to give their royal visitor a day to remember. She inspected them at a passing out parade and she watched them being put through their paces in the gym. But they wanted to treat her to a taste of the Ireland of the bog and the mountain and the poitín still. So they built their own mock-up of an illegal alcohol still and led Princess Elizabeth to an innocent looking turf stack which was not what it seemed. Then, in a spontaneous gesture, they presented the 19-year-old princess with a bottle of poitín. Charles Friel remembers hearing the story from his father, a sergeant instructor, who was in on the plan. ""My father and the recruits had all dressed up in very old clothes and looked like vagabonds and rough guys distilling this poitín,"" he explained. ""For years afterwards he kept the jumper that was full of holes and wore it while he was gardening. My mother used to give off to him about this and he'd say: 'Well, if it was good enough for the Princess, it is good enough for me to garden in."" But the high jinks with the poitín bottle did not end there. The Princess and the poitín caused a political stir too. Mr Friel said a young Ian Paisley was in the crowd that day and he had enough influence to get the matter raised at Stormont. ""All sorts of folk got rockets: Why did this happen, how did it happen, why did they distill illicit poitín and why was the Princess embarrassed into being offered some,"" Mr Friel explained. ""The row went on for quite a while."" After her brush with a bottle of poitín, Princess Elizabeth met veterans from World War I and boarded HMS Superb in Belfast. She would be just 20 years old the following month and would marry Prince Philip the following year.

Syria rebels 'break government siege' of Aleppo,"Sources close to government forces denied that they had been pushed aside and said they had driven the rebels back from an artillery base. UK-based activists say the rebels have indeed managed to link up with their comrades in eastern Aleppo. But the rebels have so far failed to establish a secure route, they add. There were sporadic clashes and air strikes on Sunday morning, after the reported ending of the siege, monitors said. Children burn tyres to create no-fly zones Government forces cut Aleppo's rebel-held areas off in July, with some 250,000 people living under siege. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, said the rebels had broken the siege but the route was ""not fully secure yet"". On Friday, the rebel groups said they had stormed an artillery base in the city. But the Syrian army said it had repelled the assault and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels. Meanwhile, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters seized most of Manbij - a key Syrian city - from so-called Islamic State. 'Major progress' Fawaz Gerges, who is professor of Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics, told the BBC News Channel that the rebels had certainly made gains. ""The rebels coalition - it's called the Army of Conquest - has basically made some major progress,"" he said. ""It has been able to score some major gains in the past 48 hours. The question is not whether the opposition has made some progress or not [but] whether they can really maintain the areas that they occupy and whether they can consolidate it."" The Syrian army has been fighting the rebels with the help of Russian air strikes. Earlier this week, Russian state television ran pictures of civilians and fighters reportedly leaving the city through humanitarian corridors announced by Moscow. But some rebel groups described the Russian initiative as a ploy to recapture all of Aleppo. Aleppo was once Syria's commercial capital and also boasted a rich architectural and archaeological heritage. Much of it has been destroyed or looted during more than five years of war.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cornish businesses receive government demands to recall EU cash,"The cash was handed out to businesses and public sector organisations in Cornwall to promote development. Businesses said the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) was demanding funds be returned - due to EU rules not being followed. The DCLG said it had to make sure the grant funding was spent correctly. 'Unfairly penalised' In November, the BBC first revealed the government was clawing back millions of pounds, but since then, more demands have been issued with official letters alleging irregularities in the way some businesses have spent their money. Andrew Marston, who developed Jubilee Warehouse, a hub for creative businesses in Penryn, faces paying back £200,000. He said: ""It's a very worrying situation for a small business."" Cornwall's EU millions The county receives the most money in England £400m of EU funding between 2000 and 2006 £500m of EU funding between 2007 and 2013 £416m of further funding coming between 2014 and 2020 He has already spent the money, but the UK government did not think his firm had advertised a construction contract in the correct way, he added. ""We're confident we've complied with the guidance but it takes a lot of time to research and provide a very detailed response."" George Eustice, the Conservative MP for Camborne and Redruth, said he had written to the DCLG requesting it reviews projects ""affected by claw backs and [those] unfairly penalised"". Analysis: Neil Gallacher, BBC Spotlight's Business Correspondent This issue has had relatively little attention and it ha been very difficult to persuade those on the receiving end of claw-back attempts to speak publicly. After all, they find themselves accused of having done something wrong. But we know there are many organisations caught up in this including public sector organisations and charities, private developers, education providers, arts organisers and even big infrastructure firms. So far, ministers have not done interviews on this topic. The fact one of Cornwall's Conservative MPs, George Eustice, has spoken of some local companies being ""unfairly penalised"" by UK civil servants may now focus more attention on the subject. A DCLG spokesman refused to outline the specific issues being raised with businesses or the amounts involved. But, he said: ""From the outset every project agrees a funding contract which includes regular checks and if expenditure is found to have been inappropriate then the overall value of the award is reduced.""

"Paedophile Ivor Gifford, 92, jailed for grooming girls","Ivor Gifford, from Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, was found guilty of sending explicit messages to fake profiles set up by a paedophile-hunting group. The group, known as The Hunted One, later confronted Gifford and passed chat logs and evidence to the police. Judge Daniel Williams told Gifford he represented ""a high risk"" to children. Newport Crown Court heard two profiles, ""Jessie"" and ""Jodie"" were set up by the group, which Gifford then contacted via an internet chatroom. The jury heard he was ""persistent"" in his attempts to send messages and comments of a sexual nature, despite repeatedly being told he was speaking to 11 and 12-year-old girls. Over 100 pages of chat logs were handed to Gwent Police by the group behind the sting, in which Gifford referred to sexual acts and sent images of himself naked. He asked one profile to ""dress sexy"" when they agreed to meet him. But he was later confronted by the vigilante group at a train station in Llanhilleth, before being arrested. The court heard Gifford was said to feel regret and embarrassment and was without any family support since being remanded in custody in December 2016. Judge Williams said Gifford sent messages of a sexually explicit nature and asked ""Jodie"" to send a nude photograph. The court heard Gifford made a second attempt to groom what he believed to be an 11-year-old girl, ""Jessie"", and asked her for a ""naughty photo"". ""When you travelled in a taxi to meet Jessie at Llanhilleth, you realised you'd been set up,"" said Judge Williams. ""The truth is, despite your denials in interview and in evidence, you were on the internet looking for young girls and looking for young girls to engage in sexual activity. ""You're 92 years of age. That age is reflected in your physical health, which is far from good, but you're mentally well."" Representing Gifford, Jeffrey Jones said his client had suffered a heart attack and a stroke, and had ""very limited"" mobility. ""He is very advanced in life,"" Mr Jones said. ""He is in a state of shock at the publicity of the matter and the loss of his good name. ""He utters that the last thing he wants to do is bother on the internet again."" Gifford was also made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years and he will be prevented from working with children.

Woman who took Stone of Destiny back to Scotland dies,"Kay Matheson was one of a group of four students who took the relic from Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1950. The stone was taken back to Scotland from where it had been removed by Edward I in 1296 as a spoil of war. Ms Matheson, who drove a car carrying the stone through police road blocks, died in Wester Ross at the age of 84. She had been studying domestic science at the University of Glasgow when she joined the plot to take the stone from London. The others involved were Ian Hamilton, Gavin Vernon and Alan Stuart. During their raid on Westminster Abbey the stone broke into two pieces. Police launched a huge manhunt, but driving alone Ms Matheson was able to negotiate road blocks and cross the border into Scotland. In the weeks that followed, police arrived at her family's croft in Wester Ross and searched the property. Symbolic gesture Five months later the students placed the stone, also known as the Stone of Scone, in Arbroath Abbey. The authorities had it taken back to Westminster Abbey, but in 1996 it was returned to Scotland as a symbolic gesture and is now kept at Edinburgh Castle. Ms Matheson, who later became a teacher and Gaelic scholar, and the others were not prosecuted. Mr Hamilton told The Observer newspaper in 2008, when a film based on his book about the 1950s incident was released, that the government had feared Scots would take to the streets if the students had ended up in the courts. American actress Kate Mara portrayed Ms Matheson in the movie, Stone of Destiny. Charlie Cox, Billy Boyd and Robert Carlyle also starred. Another film, An Ceasnachadh, focused on Ms Matheson's interrogation by the authorities. Gaelic singer Kathleen MacInnes played the role of Ms Matheson. It also told of her dedication to Gaelic and how she drew inspiration from the works of Victorian Gaelic poet Mairi Mhor nan Oran - Big Mary of the Songs. Ms Matheson was living in a care home at Aultbea, near Loch Ewe, when she died. Rob Gibson, SNP MSP for Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, paid tribute to her. He said: ""Her exploits in retrieving the stone made her one of the immortals in Scottish nationalist history."" Mr Gibson said she had worked hard to revive the use of Gaelic in Wester Ross and was a popular and respected teacher and figure in the local community. Lib Dem MP Charles Kennedy described Ms Matheson as an ""inspirational force"". He said: ""The redoubtable Kay was a truly remarkable character, one of whom I was truly fond and someone who was tremendously kind towards me. ""I was apprehensive in the extreme when I first stood locally in 1983 to find Kay - of Stone of Destiny fame - as my SNP opponent. ""In fact we hit it off so well that a firm friendship was formed.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Aberthaw pollution position 'untenable', says court legal adviser","By Steffan MessengerBBC Wales Environment Correspondent The court is considering its verdict in an infringement hearing about emissions from coal-fired Aberthaw. It is alleged the site has been pumping out more than double the legal amount of toxic nitrogen oxides for seven years. The UK Government argues the power station is not in breach of the rules. It further claims that the Vale of Glamorgan plant has made major investments to try to improve its performance. 'Disaster' In a document summarising his opinion of the case, advocate general of the European Court of Justice, Michal Bobek, says he finds the arguments put by the UK to be ""untenable"". He proposes that the court find the UK to be in breach of its obligations under EU rules to limit pollution levels. Director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, Gareth Clubb, said: ""Since at least 2001, Aberthaw power station has had no legal justification for emitting horrific amounts of toxic pollution into the atmosphere. ""The judgement spells disaster for Aberthaw. It's very difficult to see how it can avoid permanent closure once the Court of Justice reaches its final verdict."" In April, BBC Wales revealed that Aberthaw's operator, RWE, is set to downgrade the plant so that it only generates electricity at times of peak demand. The UK government has said it wants all coal-fired power stations to close by 2025. Emissions RWE said it was ""disappointed"" with the advocate general's opinion but would await the final EU court judgement. The UK government had claimed that an exemption in the law around air pollution for plants burning low volatile coal was aimed at sites such as Aberthaw, given that the anthracite coal it uses is sourced locally, harder to burn and important to the local economy. ""Aberthaw Power Station was specifically designed to burn Welsh, regional, low volatile coal and historically, 60% of its fuel diet is Welsh,"" a RWE spokesperson said, adding that ""the station has always been compliant with its operational permit."" ""Following a successful installation of new technology to one unit at the plant the nitrogen oxide emissions have been substantially reduced. RWE has committed to further reduce emissions and increase fuel diversity, despite very difficult market conditions.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Home Secretary Sajid Javid reveals moped mugging,"In a Sun on Sunday interview, Mr Javid said he reached for his phone to call a taxi outside Euston station when the thieves rode on to the pavement. They grabbed his phone and zoomed off, he said, which left him ""angry and upset"". He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped thieves. ""Before I knew what was happening, it (the phone) had gone,"" said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK's policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened a couple of years ago, he said: ""I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky not to have been stabbed or beaten up like many other victims who fall prey to these vicious criminals."" His revelation comes days after comedian Michael McIntyre was robbed by men on a moped in north-west London. Home Office proposals announced last month aim to give police drivers more legal protection and aim to smash the ""myth"" that officers cannot pursue riders who are not wearing helmets. It followed concerns among officers that they risk prosecution for careless or dangerous driving if they chase criminals at high speed, particularly those on mopeds and motorcycles.

Red Peak: New Zealanders rally behind 'fifth' flag design,"Red Peak, designed by Wellington resident Aaron Dustin, was on the long list but did not make the final four. The finalists were revealed to widespread disdain last week, with many saying said they were too boring, too corporate or unrepresentative. But PM John Key has already said no to adding Red Peak into the contest. Mr Dustin has made the case that his flag design is simple and meaningful. He says on his blog it uses the shape of traditional weaving patterns, and ""suggests a landscape of alpine ranges, red earth, and black sky"", while referencing the Maori creation myth of Ranginui and Papatuanuku, also known as Rangi and Papa. It also highlights New Zealand's position near the international dateline, which makes it one of the ""first to hold the light of new day"", he said. 'Appropriately symbolic' By Monday evening, more than 28,000 people had signed a petition started four days ago by a C Wilson. ""The other options look like a random assemblage of clipart. This looks like a flag,"" said Auckland resident, Camryn Brown. ""This is drawable, strongly and appropriately symbolic flag that looks like a FLAG. It will be something I could proudly display,"" said another signatory, Liza Bolton. Oscar Hemingway in Auckland said Red Peak was ""has the simplicity needed to be a memorable symbol and its colors and shapes represent the nation well. It deserves at least to be on the short lost and given its fair chance"". But Mr Key has shot down the petition, saying there was ""a well set out process"" and the cabinet had already accepted the four nominations. ""To accept any other flag... we would have to change the law, and we're not going back to parliament to change the law,"" he told a morning talkshow. New Zealanders will have the chance to choose their favourite design in a referendum later this year. Then in 2016, another referendum will be held to decide whether to scrap the existing flag and replace it with the winner. Mr Key has argued New Zealand needs a new flag as its current one, adopted in 1902, is too similar to Australia's, and the country needs one which better reflects its values. But critics say the exercise is costly and unnecessary. It is expected to cost the New Zealand government more than 27m New Zealand dollars (£11m; $17m), according to news portal Stuff.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Burnley stabbing: Marks & Spencer worker and shopper hurt,"The two women were hurt in the attack in the St James Street store in Burnley at 09:30 GMT, Lancashire Police said. A force spokesman said both were taken to hospital but their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Supt Stasia Osiowy praised the ""brave actions"" of passers-by, who detained a 57-year-old man, who was then arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She said the attack was ""not being treated as a terrorism incident, but due to some comments made at the scene, counter-terrorism detectives will be leading on the investigation"". 'Brave actions' Detectives were ""keeping an open mind as to motivation"", she said, but were ""considering the mental health background"" of the arrested man. Supt Osiowy thanked ""members of the public who acted very quickly, and without regard to their own safety, in order to detain the attacker"". ""Without their brave actions, this incident, while serious, could have been so much worse,"" she said. The force spokesman said the two women, a staff member in her 40s and a customer in her 60s, had ""thankfully"" not been seriously injured. A knife was recovered at the scene. Carl Stredder, who was shopping with his wife at the time, had stopped at the cash machine opposite Marks & Spencer when he heard shouting coming from the store. He told the BBC he saw a man ""holding down"" another man before the emergency services arrived at the scene. ""Within a couple of minutes, the police had arrived. There were six or seven police cars, sirens all over the place,"" he said. ""Then within another five or so minutes, an ambulance came. It was apparent by then that some sort of major incident had occurred."" He added: ""It was a bit of a frightener when we came home and realised in the cold light of day what could have happened."" A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the company was ""incredibly grateful"" to the emergency services and pleased both victims were ""now in good care"". ""Our focus is on ensuring that our colleagues in Burnley receive all the support they need,"" he added. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Why politicians still dream of controlling the internet,"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter Both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump clearly thinks it is time for national governments to grasp control of the internet to bend it to their own political purposes. China's leader was speaking in Wuzhen at an event called the World Internet Conference, which sounds grand and did bring in delegates from leading technology companies including Apple and Microsoft, plus the Internet naming body ICANN. But the only world leaders in attendance were from Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, countries presumably sympathetic to China's view of how the internet should be governed. ""Cyberspace is similar to the real world in that both freedom and order are necessary,"" President Xi declared in his opening keynote speech. But it seems that ""order"" is the priority in China, where the increasingly sophisticated Great Firewall acts as a strict border control for the internet, making sure it conforms with the Communist Party's view of the world. Mr Xi did make this call for global co-operation: ""Each country should join hands and together curb the abuse of information technology, oppose network surveillance and hacking, and fight against a cyberspace arms race."" But he also called for ""cyber sovereignty"" with each country respecting the right of others to manage the internet according to their own priorities. The United States, which has accused China of being a leading offender when it comes to hacking and the ""cyberspace arms race"" will look at the Chinese president's speech with a sceptical eye. But some American politicians may share his view that it is time to rein in the internet. Take Donald Trump. At last night's Republican debate, he declared that technology was the way to take on the terrorist threat: ""We should be able to penetrate the internet and find out exactly where Isis is."" The internet was ""our idea"" but the US needed to ""close off areas of the internet"" because Isis was using it better. ""We can do that if we use our good people."" Mr Trump's somewhat sketchy ideas about how the internet works came in for plenty of ribbing on social media. But his view that this online wild west needs to be tamed is one that is increasingly common among US politicians and security chiefs. After all, Hillary Clinton, who could end up in a battle for the White House with Mr Trump, has called on the technology firms - those ""good people"" - to disrupt the terrorists. The idealistic internet pioneers - most of them American - saw it as a global community without borders, a space for free exchange of ideas untrammelled by national laws. But whether it is China determined to shore up its Great Firewall, the US wanting to curb communications between terror groups, or indeed Europe debating at what age children should be allowed online, local politicians are asserting their right to bend the internet to their will.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google fights French 'right to be forgotten' order,"In 2015, the Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) said Google should respect French ""right to be forgotten"" rulings worldwide. But Google said the ruling could lead to abuse by ""less open and democratic"" countries. The company is now appealing against a 100,000-euro (£76,000) CNIL fine. What is the 'right to be forgotten'? The ""right to be forgotten"" refers to a landmark ruling passed by the European Union's Court of Justice (ECJ) in May 2014. It gives people the right to have results linked to their name removed from search websites, if they ""appear to be inadequate"" or ""irrelevant"". Google says results can end up removed ""even when those links point to truthful and lawfully published information like newspaper articles or official government websites"". Companies offering services to European citizens must comply with the ruling, even if their websites are not hosted in Europe. Google said it had reviewed almost 1.5 million requests, of which about 40% resulted in the removal of a search result. What has Google been ordered to do? Google has previously said it does remove results when a valid ""right to be forgotten"" request is made. However, it currently does not remove the affected search results from all versions of its website worldwide. People using Google in Europe cannot find the deleted results using any version of the search engine - but people outside Europe can see the affected search results when they use a non-European version of the website such as google.com. The CNIL wants Google to remove the affected search results globally. It has pointed out it is relatively simple for Europeans to access international versions of Google and find the deleted results. Why has Google refused? Google has argued that a French authority such as the CNIL should not ""impose measures outside of the nation's borders"". ""For hundreds of years, it has been an accepted rule of law that one country should not have the right to impose its rules on the citizens of other countries,"" said Kent Walker, the company's general counsel. In an open letter published in French newspaper Le Monde, Google said it had already received requests from countries to block content worldwide that was illegal locally. ""If French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries - perhaps less open and democratic - start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach?"" it said. ""This order could lead to a global race to the bottom, harming access to information that is perfectly lawful to view in one's own country. ""This is not just a hypothetical concern. We have received demands from governments to remove content globally on various grounds. ""We have resisted, even if that has sometimes led to the blocking of our services."" According to AFP, Google expects the Council of State, France's highest court, will take at least a year to review its appeal. ""We look forward to the court's review of this case,"" said Mr Walker.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Red defeat in Belarus Xmas 'star wars',"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Local historian Lyavon Tsimokhin raised the alert after passing through Central Square in Maladzyechna, north-west of the capital Minsk, where he noticed a large five-pointed Kremlin Star - a symbol of Soviet power dating back to the days of dictator Joseph Stalin - perched on top of the tall, brightly-decorated tree, the RG news site reports. The red steel-and-glass stars earned their name after Stalin ordered them installed on the towers of the Moscow Kremlin in the 1930s, to replace the copper two-headed eagles associated with the pre-revolutionary Tsarist regime. Throughout the post-war period, the Kremlin star became associated with the New Year celebrations that the authorities promoted in an attempt to eclipse Christmas and Epiphany. It can still touch a raw nerve with many people in former Soviet countries who associate it with Communist repression. This is particularly the case in Belarus, where the pro-Russian government often praises the Soviet legacy - down to the interior minister dressing in a Stalinist secret-police uniform at a parade last year. Local human-rights campaigner Eduard Balanchuk certainly lost no time in making his feelings felt. 'Thank you for listening' ""I went to the district executive committee to get the ruby-red 'Kremlin' star taken down,"" he told RG. ""The five-pointed star is not a Christian symbol, and it violates the rights of believers who are celebrating Christmas."" Protests of this sort do not often prevail in Belarus at either government or local level, as Mr Balanchuk knows well. The veteran activist spent 15 days in jail last year for monitoring a peaceful protest as an official representative of the Belarusian Helskini Committee human-rights group. You might also be interested in: On this occasion he was pleased to thank the committee's deputy chief, Alyesya Lukouskaya, for ""listening to us. Now the Star of Bethlehem has pride of place"".

"US creates 242,000 jobs in February","The Labor Department numbers underlined the strength of the US economy and may allow the Federal Reserve to gradually raise interest rates this year. Another 30,000 jobs were also added to the previous estimates for December and January. The unemployment rate was unchanged from January at 4.9% - an eight-year low. Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ""This should scotch suggestions that the US is about to tip into recession. It's yet more evidence that the labour market is in good shape, although wage growth was more disappointing."" The year-on-year growth in average hourly earnings slowed to 2.2% last month from 2.5% in January. Last week, official figures indicated that the US economy expanded at an annualised pace of 1% in the quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 0.7%. The strong jobs market and improved growth outlook, together with signs that inflation is creeping up, could prompt the Fed to raise rates in the summer. It did so in December for the first time in nearly a decade - a decision that had been criticised by some for holding back the economic recovery. Services growth However, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, questioned whether the Fed would act anytime soon. ""Current signs of rising inflationary pressures and a tightening labour market need to be viewed alongside indications that the pace of economic growth may be slowing, and possibly sharply, amid growing concerns about the outlook,"" he said. ""The big question will be the extent to which the Fed heeds the warning lights flashing in the background."" The services sector created 245,000 jobs last month after adding 153,000 jobs in January, while construction added 19,000 positions and government added 12,000. However, mining lost a further 18,000 jobs after shedding 9,000 positions the previous month, and the manufacturing sector shed 16,000 jobs, reversing some of January's surprise increase. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit rose in January as exports fell for a fourth consecutive month. The Commerce Department said the gap between exports and imports climbed to $45.7bn in January from a revised $44.7bn in December. Exports of goods and services fell 2.1% in January to $176.5bn - the lowest since June 2011. US exporters have been hurt by a global economic slowdown and by a strong dollar that makes US products more expensive overseas. Imports fell 1.3% to $222.1bn - the lowest since April 2011.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Creative Scotland funding system 'below expected standard',"The arts organisation has been heavily criticised over funding decisions, which saw board members resign in protest earlier this year. MSPs said the organisation needed to urgently address strategic failings. Creative Scotland praised its staff and said it was conducting a review of the funding process. In January, despite an increased financial settlement, Creative Scotland refused funding to 21 organisations, many of them long established. Support to five groups was subsequently reinstated, but there were calls for the group to overhaul its processes. Creative Scotland said some of the touring theatre companies would be eligible for a new fund, which has yet to be launched. Holyrood's cross-party culture committee carried out an inquiry into the funding process, which heard evidence from more than 50 artists and organisations. In their findings, MSPs said the information was poorly communicated, left organisations in a challenging position and seriously damaged the confidence of the sector. 'Badly damaged' Committee convener Joan McAlpine said: ""We received unprecedented levels of representations from within the sector following Creative Scotland's handling of regular funding for 2018-21. ""With more than 50 responses from artists and arts organisations, it is clear to us that the confidence of a significant element of the cultural sector in Creative Scotland's regular funding process has been badly damaged. ""In particular we felt that the handling of the process in relation to touring theatre and dance companies fell well below the standard that is expected from a non-departmental public body."" Chairman Robert Wilson said Creative Scotland would provide a full reply to the culture committee by its August deadline. In an initial response, he said the committee had called for evidence before ""important discussions"" had taken place with individual organisations to explain decisions and address their concerns. ""It is of concern, therefore, that much of the criticism that has been made reflects unduly negatively on Creative Scotland and particularly on our staff,"" he said. ""I have no doubt about their commitment to this process and their expertise, professionalism and integrity in the work they do more broadly."" 'Chorus of agreement' Mr Wilson said Creative Scotland was conducting an independent review of the last round of regular funding. ""This regular funding review will feed into the planned wider review of our overall funding approach which we aim to have completed by the end of this year,"" he said. He added that a wider organisational review was looking at its culture, working practices, values, structure and operations. David Leddy, artistic director of the Fire Exit theatre company, said: ""The report is utterly damning and yet utterly unsurprising. ""Creative Scotland have repeatedly tried to argue that gaping holes in their work were simply minor glitches. ""Yet there has been a chorus of agreement from the arts, media and general public that Creative Scotland's behaviour has been unethical, unrigorous and unfit for purpose.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russia says Turkey 'shot down plane for IS oil',"Speaking at international talks on climate change in Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the downing of the plane a ""huge mistake"". Turkey has denied any ties to IS and is part of a US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against the militant group. The Turkish government has refused to apologise for the incident. One Russian pilot was killed and the other rescued following the crash on 24 November. Turkey says the jet entered its air space - an accusation Russia denies. On Monday the US state department said evidence from Turkish and US sources indicated the aircraft did violate Turkish airspace. Spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the US wanted to ""encourage dialogue now... we need to de-escalate the situation"". Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria, targeting rebels against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including IS. Turkey is a vehement opponent of Mr Assad and has been accused of turning a blind eye to jihadist fighters crossing from its territory into Syria. Until a few months ago, Turkey was reluctant to play an active role in the coalition against IS. However, in August it allowed the US-led coalition to begin using its airbase at Incirlik. Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey over the downing of the plane, including restrictions on imports of Turkish food and an end to visa-free travel. IS earns much of its money from illegal sales of oil - however, Turkey has staunchly denied that it is involved in the trade. ""We have every reason to think that the decision to shoot down our plane was dictated by the desire to protect the oil supply lines to Turkish territory,"" Mr Putin said at a news conference in Paris on Monday. He said Russia had received more information to show that IS oil was passing through Turkish territory. Earlier Turkish Prime Minster Ahmet Davutoglu said the incident was unfortunate but that Turkey had a right and duty to protect its airspace and would not apologise. Russia said on Monday it would ban mainly imports of agricultural products, vegetables and fruits from Turkey, although it may delay the restrictions for several weeks to ""ease inflationary pressure"". Turkish industrial goods would not be banned for now but future expansion of the sanctions was not ruled out, officials said. Turkey and Russia have important economic links. Russia is Turkey's second-largest trading partner, while more than three million Russian tourists visited Turkey last year. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country will act ""patiently, not emotionally"" before deciding its response to the economic sanctions.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Botulism warning over Loyd Grossman korma sauce,"The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was a manufacturer's decision. ""Only one jar from the batch is known to have been contaminated with the bacteria clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism,"" said the FSA. The batch is 350g jars with a best before date of February 2013, and a batch code of 1218R 07:21. The FSA said two members of the same family had contracted botulism after eating a meal made with the sauce and had been taken to hospital. Their condition now is not known. 'Precautionary measure' Although only one jar is known to be affected, the FSA is advising people not to eat products from this batch ""as a precautionary measure"". The FSA stressed no other batches of Loyd Grossman products were thought to be affected. The FSA said it would give out more information when it becomes available. Meanwhile, in a separate statement, the Health Protection Agency said preliminary tests had identified the toxin that causes botulism from the used jar. It said it was now working with the Scottish authorities and the Food Standards Agency on the investigation. Dr Kathie Grant, a botulinum toxin expert at the HPA, said cases of botulism were rare in the UK ""although it can be a very serious infection in those that are affected"". Botulism symptoms ""We urge the public to take heed of this message and ensure that they immediately dispose of this product and to be aware of the signs and symptoms of botulism, which include blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, headaches and muscle weakness,"" she said. Botulism is caused by a bacterium, which attacks the nervous system. It is not contagious. Symptoms include blurred vision, difficulty swallowing and may progress to general muscle weakness. Botulism poisoning presents symptoms between 12 and 36 hours after eating the contaminated food. It is easily treated if a doctor or hospital is notified early. Anyone who is concerned they may have contracted botulism after eating sauce from the batch should seek urgent medical advice by visiting a hospital.

Russian military plane crash in Syria kills dozens,"The An-26 plane crashed during landing at Hmeimim airbase, near the coastal city of Latakia, the ministry is quoted as saying by Russian media. It says all 39 military personnel on board died, not 32 as earlier reported. The plane was not fired upon, the ministry says, and preliminary data suggests a technical malfunction could have caused the crash. An investigation is now under way. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims' relatives. Meanwhile, medics in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area of Syria say they have been treating people with breathing problems after a suspected chlorine attack. The reports follow government air strikes and shelling just hours after the last UN aid envoy left the enclave following a supposed five-hour truce. In a separate development, UN war crimes investigators say air strikes in Syria by both Russia and the US-led coalition killed large numbers of civilians last year. What is known about Tuesday's plane crash? The Russian defence ministry says the An-26 crashed at about 15:00 Moscow Time (12:00 GMT). It says the plane went down about 500m (1640ft) from the runway. A special commission is to be set up to investigate the crash. On 7 January, Russian forces said they had foiled a drone attack on Hmeimim. This was just a week after Russian warplanes were damaged at the airbase in a rebel mortar attack. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces to recover much lost ground. What are Russia's air force losses in Syria? Russia launched its military operation in September 2015, saying it was acting upon a request by President Assad. Here are the confirmed air force losses: What about the suspected chlorine attack in Eastern Ghouta? The attack targeted the town of Hammoria and led to the evacuation of dozens of civilians, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Local medics said they were treating a number of people who had breathing problems. Syria denied allegations it had carried out the attack, dismissing them as an act of desperation by Western powers. Meanwhile, Russia - a key ally of the Syrian government - offered rebels safe passage out of the area. What did UN war crimes investigators say? They said they found that an attack by the US-coalition on a school near the city of Raqqa last March killed 150 local residents - many times more than Washington had admitted to. The investigators also said Russian air strikes on a market in Atareb, west of Aleppo, killed at least 84 people last November. Their report talked too of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces, and war crimes allegedly committed by their rebel opponents.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Orca John Coe causes a stir off Anglesey,"The bull known to conservationists as John Coe can be identified by a notch on his dorsal fin and a missing chunk on his fluke. He was photographed with an unidentified orca by Laura Kudelska, of RSPB Cymru, on 9 June. In March, Scottish conservationists say John Coe was spotted from near Dingle in south west Ireland. He is more often seen off the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides. The appearance of John Coe and the other orca off Anglesey was the cause of some excitement. Ms Kudelska, RSPB South Stack site manager, said: ""We often get reports of large marine mammals like minke spotted around RSPB South Stack in Anglesey, but unfortunately none of the staff ever get a 'confirmed sighting' which usually involves photographic evidence. ""So when a visitor came in saying they had spent an hour watching two killer whales and they were still there, we ran with a camera to see them."" She added: ""It was amazing to see two long black fins pop up. It is a first for me and the site team, we all felt privileged to have seen these beautiful majestic marine mammals."" RSPB Cymru marine policy officer, Emily Williams, said the appearance of the orcas underlined the need for greater protection of Wales' marine environment. She said: ""We're hoping that a new Marine Area Statement under development by Natural Resources Wales will help to look at some of these issues and focus on the resilience of the marine ecosystem. ""This is vital to enable Wales' seas to continue to provide a home to such spectacular wildlife"" Shark bite John Coe is one of eight orcas of a group known as the West Coast Community. A ninth member, Lulu, was found dead on the Isle of Tiree in 2016 after becoming entangled in fishing lines. Tests later revealed her body contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded. The chemicals were banned from the 1970s but are still in the environment. John Coe is believed to have had his own brush with death. The injury to his fluke is thought to have been inflicted by a shark. Mull-based Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, which helps to monitor the West Coast Community, has noted the sighting of John Coe off Wales. The trust said: ""John Coe is part of a unique group of killer whales called the West Coast Community, identifiable from other groups of killer whales seen around the UK by their downwards sloping eye patch and larger size."" Scotland's seas are also visited by another group of ocras that arrive from Iceland each spring to raise young and to hunt.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Casement Park: Minister Carál Ní Chuilín recalled over GAA stadium safety claims,"By Mark SimpsonBBC News NI Carál Ní Chuilín previously said she first heard about fears over Casement Park's emergency exits last year. However, that has now been contradicted by the former chairperson of Sport NI. Dominic Walsh told Stormont's Culture, Arts and Leisure committee that Ms Ní Chuilín was briefed on the concerns at a meeting in the summer of 2012. Mr Walsh said the then permanent secretary of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and the minister's special adviser were also present at the meeting. He said it was a detailed conversation and they even discussed the possible purchase of houses near Casement Park to accommodate better exiting arrangements. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) wants to build a new stadium on its existing grounds at Casement Park, west Belfast, but the multi-million pound project has been beset with problems and delays. Its planning permission was overturned last year. Stormont's Culture, Arts and Leisure committee is conducting an inquiry into whether ""appropriate consideration was given to plans for emergency exiting during the design process"". In a statement on Thursday afternoon, Ms Nί Chuilίn denied misleading the committee. Previously, she said the first she heard of the safety concerns was April last year, when Sport NI's stadium expert Paul Scott gave evidence to the committee. In a BBC interview at the time, the minister said the safety concerns had not been known to her ""ever before"". She added: ""I am absolutely confident that had concerns of that nature been raised with my officials before, I would have heard about it."" However, Mr Walsh insisted on Thursday that the minister was present at a regular Friday ""update meeting"" in the summer of 2012 at which the issues were discussed. Committee member William Humphrey, from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said it was important to find out if the minister had ""misremembered or misled"" the committee. Its members voted in favour of asking her to return to the committee to explain what happened. Ms Nί Chuilίn said she welcomed the opportunity to ""again present evidence and rebut allegations made by other parties"". ""I have put on record that I was not aware of allegations in relation to concerns around emergency exiting at Casement Park prior to April 2015. I am happy to put this on record again today and will do so again before the committee. ""Also, on being made aware of these allegations in April 2015, I immediately commissioned a fully independent Project Assessment Review (PAR) led by the British Cabinet Office to provide overall assurance of the Regional Stadia Programme and Casement Park in particular.

Care home residents say moving 'worse than death',"Derbyshire County Council said seven of its care homes were ""no longer fit for purpose"" because of the poor building quality. The authority has launched a public consultation on draft proposals that would see all seven close. But relatives of some residents with dementia said they feared their loved ones would not cope with being moved. Up to 235 residents would be moved to alternative care home accommodation if the seven homes were closed, but the council said nobody would be forced to start paying for their own care. The homes due to close are Ladycross House in Sandiacre, Beechcroft in West Hallam, East Clune in Clowne, Holmlea in Tibshelf, The Spinney in Brimington, Goyt Valley House in New Mills and Gernon Manor in Bakewell. Ladycross volunteer Dean Stevenson has been leading a campaign to keep it open but said residents were feeling ""very low"". ""Some are refusing. If it comes to it, they said they're not moving regardless, although they won't have much choice,"" he said. ""Some are saying it's their time to go [die]. They want to go because they don't want to move."" Silvia Bonser, 89, has dementia and lives at Ladycross Care Home. Her daughter Janet Burns said she did not believe her mother would cope with a move. And she dismissed claims by the council that the building needed ""extensive work"". ""It's just been all refurbished and it's lovely - new chairs, state of the art bathrooms, new kitchen,"" she said. Another care home facing closure is Beechcroft in West Hallam, where World War Two Parachute Regiment veteran Pete Watkins lives. His step-daughter Lynn Thornley said he suffered from dementia and the family was worried about the affects of a move on his health. ""He will lose familiar surroundings and may lose the familiar company and comfort and we don't know how this will affect him,"" she said. Helen Jones - executive director for adult social care and health at Derbyshire County Council - described the situation as ""regrettable"". ""We have a duty to provide older people with the care and support they need in safe surroundings fit for the 21st Century,"" she said. ""We consider seven of these buildings are no longer fit for purpose and do not allow older people to live with dignity."" The consultation, which runs until 24 April, also includes plans to refurbish three other care homes. A petition against the closure of Ladycross has been set up by local Conservative MP Maggie Throup and several meetings and protests are planned.

RNLI rescued record number of people in Scotland in 2012,"The charity's annual statistics show that its volunteer crews went to the aid of 1,055 people. Its previous highest number was 1,026 in 2006. The RNLI said the number of people rescued after getting stuck on rocks, in mud, or cut off by the tide had increased.

The busiest station for the second consecutive year was Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, with 103 launches, during which 37 people were rescued. Queensferry, near Edinburgh, was the busiest inshore station and its crew has been the busiest operating an inshore lifeboat for several years. During 2012, it launched 66 times and rescued 163 people, the highest among Scotland's stations. Kessock near Inverness, Kippford in Dumfries and Galloway, Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire and Largs in Ayrshire were among other stations that had busier years in 2012 than 2011. Scotland's newest station, Leverburgh in the Western Isles, opened on a trial basis in May and it was called out on emergencies on 11 occasions, rescuing 25 people. The RNLI will make a decision on the future of the all-weather station later this year. Anstruther helmsman Barry Gourlay was awarded the charity's bronze medal for his actions during a night-time rescue of two people from a motorboat driven on to rocks by high winds. Arbroath, Scotland's sixth busiest station with 41 launches, saved two Dundee men who had spent more than two hours at sea after their craft broke down in freezing waters off the east coast in late November. Ben Thomson, one of the men, said: ""By the time Arbroath lifeboat picked us up, we were in a really bad way. ""I just want to express my thanks to the crew as, without them, I don't know if I would be here today."" Andy Clift, the RNLI's regional operations manager for Scotland, said: ""The figures show that our volunteers dedicate a huge amount of their time to saving lives at sea. ""To know that they are on call 24/7, every day of the year, is reassuring for all of us who venture out to sea around the Scottish coast.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sir Jimmy Young enters Radio Hall of Fame,"The 90-year-old was one of four radio figures honoured by the industry body. The other inductees were Jane Garvey, who presents BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, BBC 5 live drivetime host Peter Allen and Smooth Radio's Andy Peebles. Radio Academy chief executive John Myers said they had all been ""hugely influential in the industry"". Sir Jimmy, who turned 90 in September, missed the ceremony in Manchester on Tuesday, instead sending an audio message saying he was ""nursing a 90-year-old very painful hip"". The message continued: ""At my first audition, way back in 1949, I was told I had no future in broadcasting. So you can imagine that makes the honour of being inducted into the Radio Academy's Hall of Fame even sweeter."" Sir Jimmy had a successful music career before becoming a broadcaster. In 1955, he became the first British singer to have two consecutive number one singles. He went on to join the BBC as one of the original Radio 1 DJs in 1967 before moving to Radio 2 in 1973. He occupied the early afternoon slot, interviewing every serving British prime minister during his time on air, as well as many other leading world figures. Previous Hall of Fame inductees include Tony Blackburn, Billy Cotton, Richard Dimbleby, Alan Freeman and The Goons. Accepting her award, Jane Garvey recalled that it was a novelty for a woman to present a radio breakfast show in the late 1980s, as she did on BBC Hereford and Worcester. She said she felt it would still be unusual for woman to have such a role today, adding: ""Many of us feel like that ought to change."" She also hailed the work of the recently-launched Sound Women, a body that aims to raise the profile of female radio broadcasters and celebrate their achievements. Rolling Stones and Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood was given a lifetime achievement honour by music royalty organisation PPL, while producer and songwriter Pete Waterman received the John Peel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music Radio. Pop star Katy Perry was named the most-played artist on UK radio in the last 12 months.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BT tops UK broadband complaints list,"It received 36 complaints for every 100,000 broadband customers - higher than the industry average of 20. BT-owned companies, Plusnet and EE, came second and third in the broadband complaints table. Vodafone had 18 complaints for every 100,000 of its mobile customers - three times the industry average of six. As well as doing poorly on broadband, Plusnet and EE also received the most complaints about their fixed telephone services. The rankings come soon after BT chairman Sir Michael Rake said it had more work to do to improve customer service. ""We apologise to customers we've let down,"" said BT in a statement. ""BT cares about the service it gives to customers and we know we need to do better."" It added that some ""exceptional"" broadband outages during the third quarter contributed to the rise in complaints. Bt said it was putting cash into service improvements and recruiting widely to bolster the number of staff who handle queries and complaints, The software it uses to handle complaints was also getting an overhaul, it added. ""Customers will see an improvement as these initiatives take effect,"" it said. Big fines The quarterly Ofcom study looks at the number of complaints lodged about landlines, broadband, mobiles and Pay TV services. The complaints cover issues such as faults, billing and pricing as well as problems with services and how well they are set up by firms. They also include the ways telecoms firms deal with grievances. Ofcom said it had seen an increase in complaints about broadband and landline services between July and September. ""We won't stand for complacency when it comes to customer service,"" said Lindsey Fussell, director of Ofcom's consumer group in a statement. ""We expect providers to make it a top priority and work hard to better serve their customers."" Ofcom said it gathered data on complaints to help monitor how well companies were serving customers and to provide useful information for people who were looking to switch suppliers or sign up for new services. Ms Fussell said it investigated when customers were let down and had the power to levy significant fines. In October, Vodafone was hit with a £4.6m fine by Ofcom for breaking rules on handling complaints and misleading customers on what they received when they signed up for pay-as-you-go services. Last year, a £1m fine was levied on EE for not doing enough to tell people their rights when they made a complaint.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India police discover elephant smuggling racket,"By Subir BhaumikBBC News, Calcutta Police in Assam said five traders were arrested and some animals due to be taken out of the state were rescued. The sale and purchase of elephants is illegal in India but police say the trade is flourishing. An adult elephant fetches nearly 1m to 1.5m rupees ($22,572 to $33,841) while a calf is sold for half that amount. The rates have sharply increased over the last few years. Undetected Assam police spokesman PK Dutta said they recently arrested a man from the state's border areas and his confessions led to more arrests and the rescue of the elephants. ""Some of these illegal traders even have the audacity to print calling cards saying they deal in elephants,"" Mr Dutta told the BBC. ""We have arrested a few of them and we are trying to catch some more because we now know all those involved in this illegal trade."" Mr Dutta said a wildlife protection society, Green Heart Nature, helped the police in busting the racket. ""We investigated this illegal trade. When we sighted some of these traders, we tipped off the police and they responded speedily,"" said Bablu Dey of the Green Heart Nature, based in western Assam's Kokrajhar district. Mr Dutta is the police superintendent of Kokrajhar, through which the elephants were smuggled into other Indian states. Rules say all new-born elephants must be fitted with a microchip. But the gate at Srirampur - on Assam's border with the neighbouring state of West Bengal - does not have a microchip reader so many of the elephants could be taken out undetected. 'Heritage animal' Police say the arrested traders, who mostly come from Bihar, said that 25 to 30 elephants were annually taken out of the state on an average over the past 15 to 20 years. In the last five years, more than 100 elephants have been smuggled out of Assam, they said. ""They have been sold in fairs like the one at Sonepur in Bihar. In some cases, these elephants have also been taken to Nepal,"" Mr Dutta said. The traders generally employ mahouts - elephant riders - to catch and tame the wild elephants mostly on the edge of some forests in Assam, he said. After that, they strike deals with buyers in other states before smuggling the elephants out, he added. Police have raided seven locations in the last few days. Although many of the people involved in the trade have fled, two Assamese traders have been arrested. The elephant was recently declared as the ""heritage animal of India"". Assam's rising population and human encroachment on forests have brought man into direct conflict with the elephants and scores of people and elephants have died.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government extends consultation on hunting trophy ban,"The consultation, launched in November, was due to close on Saturday but the deadline has now been pushed back by one month. The government says this is for those who could not contribute as a result of the pre-election and Christmas periods. Minister Lord Goldsmith has said he is ""repulsed"" by trophy hunting. However, some conservationists argue money made from trophy hunting goes towards protecting endangered animals - an income source that could be lost if it was banned. There are also fears that ending the practice would mean areas of habitat end up being converted for other uses. And in May then-Environment Secretary Michael Gove sounded a note of caution. ""If particular communities have got used to deriving income from hunting, you don't want to seem as though you're basically saying, we're taking your livelihood away,"" he told the BBC Radio 5 Live podcast Beast of Man. ""We've got to make sure that there is a clear alternative, that they know that their livelihoods and their lifestyle are going to be respected and not patronised, before they will feel comfortable about moving."" Speaking at an event in Westminster on Tuesday, Environment Minister Lord Goldsmith acknowledged there were people who believe trophy hunting was an important source of funding for conservation. However, he added, the argument was ""predicated mostly on the idea of best practice, that all trophy hunting is highly and well-regulated, and that the money makes it to local communities and conservation"". ""If that was true then we would genuinely have to weigh up the arguments, the moral argument against the apparent conservation benefits. ""The purpose of this consultation is to unpick those arguments. ""How can it be good for an endangered species when the healthiest and most magnificent among them are the first to be shot?"" he asked. Also attending the event, Labour's shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""I think banning trophy hunting would send a very strong signal to the world that this is not an acceptable practise in the 21st century."" The consultation is specifically seeking views on options for importing and exporting hunting trophies to the UK. The options include introducing a ban for certain species, stricter requirements for moving certain species, banning hunting trophies altogether, or do nothing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Americans flock to beaches on Memorial Day weekend,"In Florida, state police dispersed an unauthorised gathering of hundreds of people in Daytona Beach on Saturday. In Missouri, bars at the Lake of the Ozarks were packed with revellers, who violated social-distancing rules. US coronavirus task force chief Dr Deborah Birx said she was ""very concerned"" after seeing such scenes. ""We really want to be clear all the time that social distancing is absolutely critical. And if you can't social distance and you're outside, you must wear a mask,"" Dr Birx said on ABC's This Week on Sunday. Lyda Krewson, the mayor of St Louis, Missouri, said: ""It's irresponsible and dangerous to engage in such high risk behaviour just to have some fun over the extended holiday weekend. ""Now, these folks will be going home to S. Louis and counties across Missouri and the Midwest, raising concerns about the potential of more positive cases, hospitalisations, and tragically, deaths. Deeply disturbing."" In Florida's Tampa area, the crowds were so big that authorities closed parking lots because they were full, the Associated Press reports. In California, big crowds were seen enjoying beaches over the weekend. State officials said most people were covering their faces and keeping their distance on beaches and parks. On Monday, US Vice-President Mike Pence said that some people ""would do well to be reminded about the importance of social distancing and the importance of continuing regular hygiene"". However, he added: ""We have every confidence that as restrictions are loosened in the days ahead, the American people are going to step forward and put this country back to work in a safe and responsible way."" Memorial Day - an annual holiday held on the last Monday of May - honours all those who have died serving in the US military. It marks the unofficial start of summer. The US has more coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world. It has over 1.6 million known infections and is nearing 100,000 deaths linked to the virus. All 50 US states have now partially reopened after a two-month shutdown. However, remaining restrictions vary across the country.

Lord Kilclooney clarifies 'not political equals' tweet,"The cross-bench peer's comment made the front page of the Irish News on Thursday. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme he was ""a firm supporter of equal opportunity for everyone"". However he was criticised by Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir. Mr Ó Muilleoir said: ""If I am not misinterpreting him really what he is saying is that we (nationalists) will have to stay at the back of the bus."" ""When it comes to some of the core issues of rights that nationalists just have to get in the queue."" Lord Kilclooney told Talkback on Thursday it was ""very important"" that Northern Ireland offered ""equal opportunities for everyone, whether they are Irish or British, nationalist or unionist, Catholic or Protestant"". ""Equal opportunity is essential for everyone,"" he added. ""But when it comes to equality that is a different issue, in political terms, in democratic terms, the pro-united Ireland vote is not equal to the pro-United Kingdom vote. ""In the last Stormont election, 44% voted for a united Ireland, 56% did not. ""It is not equality in political terms, but certainly we are equal in individual terms. ""What I mean by equality is that each individual irrespective of his politics or his religion has an equal opportunity in our society to get a job, to get a house, to live a free life."" Challenge to unionists Lord Kilclooney, a former deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, was a key negotiator in the Good Friday Agreement. He said he was a supporter of equality of opportunity for everyone including Irish language speakers, but that it was important to know the content of any proposed Irish language act. ""I think Irish is more important than the question of speaking it, after all more people speak Chinese or Polish in Northern Ireland than speak Irish,"" he said. ""It is not a question of who speaks it, it is a question of where it belongs and the Irish language is an old language in Ireland and we have a duty to preserve it, but it depends how you do that. ""I think we are doing it very well in Northern Ireland in the way we finance and encourage the teaching of Irish throughout the schools. ""We have got to spell out what is in this Irish language act."" Earlier this week, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said there would not be an Assembly without an Irish language act. Mr Ó Muilleoir said he believed that ""within the broad unionist community the argument has been won"" for an Irish language act and ""now we are having to outwork it"". He said the challenge for the party's ""unionist partners"" was whether they could accept that. ""The question I can't get a straight answer from unionists on is how can this be good enough in Scotland, good enough in Wales, good enough in the rest of the country but not good enough here,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Theresa May in renewed effort to close gender pay gap,"Big companies will soon be required to publish pay gap data, but the prime minister now wants smaller firms to play their part. Reducing the gap ""once and for all"" requires ""sustained action"" from employers, she said in a statement. But TUC chief Frances O'Grady said action, not words, was needed. 'Real step change' The government has already introduced a legal requirement for all employers with more than 250 employees to publish their data on gender pay and bonuses by April 2018. But Mrs May is now appealing to smaller firms to disclose their pay details. She also urged companies to take steps to help women progress through the ranks of management, ensuring better female representation at senior levels. Mrs May said firms should strive to make flexible working a reality for all staff by advertising all jobs as flexible ""from day one"" unless there were ""solid business reasons"" not to. On Thursday, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the overall gender pay gap rose marginally from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% in 2017. The gap for full-time workers, however, fell to a record low of 9.1% - down from 9.4% the previous years. Earnings in first fall for three years Sexism 'was pervasive in finance' Is the gender pay gap in sport closing? Bank under fire for lack of diversity Mrs May said: ""It is encouraging news that the gap has fallen this year for full-time workers. ""But the gender pay gap isn't going to close on its own - we all need to be taking sustained action to make sure we address this. ""We need to see a real step change in the number of companies publishing their gender pay data and offering progression and flexibility for all employees. ""That's why today I am calling on more businesses, both small and large, to take action to make sure the gender pay gap is eliminated once and for all."" 'Damp squib' However, Ms O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary, said the pay gap would continue to close at a ""snail's pace"" unless the government ""comes down much harder on employers"". She said: ""This announcement is a damp squib that will have little impact. Companies should be forced to publish their pay gaps - not merely encouraged. ""Real action would be fining businesses who do not share information on what men and women are paid, and making firms explain what steps they are taking to close their pay gaps.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
YouTube star Etika's fans tattooed in his memory,"By Tom GerkenBBC UGC & Social News Etika, real name Desmond Amofah, 29, built a following of 130,000 YouTube subscribers by reacting to releases and products from gaming company Nintendo. At one point he had a YouTube channel with more than 800,000 subscribers before it was removed from the platform. Many fans reacted to his death by changing their online avatars to Etika's logo, but others have gone a step further to pay their respects. These people have been permanently tattooed in Etika's memory. Arturo, 20, is part of YouTube group im salt, which initially gained a following by making highlight videos of Etika's YouTube streams. The channel now has around 60,000 subscribers and focuses on original content, but its creators have not forgotten how they began. ""We always loved and supported Etika,"" Arturo said. ""When he died it struck all of us pretty hard. ""We decided to do one big charity stream, playing games Etika liked, and we had some milestones: If we raised $2,000 (£1,591) I would get an Etika tattoo. ""We reached it about an hour in. At the end of the stream we had raised over $3,000 for a mental health charity."" Arturo's tattoo is of the Etika logo with the phrase ""Joycon-Boyz"" written above it - a term which Etika's fans often use to refer to themselves. It was coined by the YouTuber, a massive Nintendo fan, in reference to the company's Switch Joy-Con controllers. ""We got all our viewers and our start from Etika,"" Arturo said. ""This tattoo means a lot because he helped us become who we are now. I'm happy to get a tattoo for someone I care about."" Other people online have also shared their Etika tattoos. Jose, 20, posted his tattoo using the #joyconboyzforever hashtag, which trended on Twitter. Jose explained how the motivation behind his tattoo was linked directly to words spoken by Etika himself. ""When he died it was a lot to take in,"" Jose said. ""In his last video he was saying the world would forget about him. ""Even though he doesn't know I got this tattoo, it helps. The world isn't going to forget about him, because the tattoo stays forever."" Others on social media shared their tattoos of the Etika logo, which people typically had tattooed on their wrists. And a Twitter account set up in memory of the YouTuber summed up how many are feeling after his death. If you've been affected by a mental health issue, help and support is available.

Coronavirus: Luton gyms and leisure centres may reopen,"Last week, Public Health England (PHE) data showed the Bedfordshire town had been marked as an ""area for intervention"", along with Blackburn with Darwen, after a spike in cases. The council said it expected indoor gyms and pools to reopen from 3 August. Health bosses said it showed the town was ""doing the right things"". Last week, people in Luton were urged to take a coronavirus test - whether or not they had symptoms - amid a a rise in cases in the town. It was also announced that gyms and leisure centres would not reopen, at a time when some lockdown measures were being loosened elsewhere. Centres in the rest of England reopened on 25 July and from 1 August, the town ""will be brought in line with the rest of the country after significant progress has been made in controlling the virus"", the Department of Health said. Blackburn's leisure centres will remain closed. In Luton, which has a population of 214,000, there were 41 recorded cases of Covid-19 in the week up to 26 July, down from 61 during the week before. This means the rate per 100,000 of the population dropped from 28.5 to 19.1. For context, the number of recorded cases in Blackburn with Darwen rose from 121 to 136 in the same period and was the highest rate in England. Following the announcement that new restrictions had been imposed on residents in some areas of northern England, health secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC: ""There are other areas, like for instance Luton, that was an area of concern last week and they have managed to bring the rates of transmission and the number of new cases right down and so they've come off that list."" Luton Borough Council said it would continue to roll out mass testing and director of public health, Gerry Taylor, advised residents to continue to follow local guidance. ""This announcement from the government gives assurance that we are doing the right things to control the virus locally,"" she said. ""However, we must remain cautious and will be keeping additional local guidance in place until we receive the results from the increased testing this week so we can assess the full impact and level of community transmission."" She said this guidance would be reviewed on a weekly basis. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Steel pensions: Decision deadline 'cannot be extended',"The 122,000 members have until Friday to decide whether to stay in the current scheme. British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) trustee chairman Allan Johnston said delays could affect its viability. A local MP had called for the deadline to be put back over concerns about poor financial advice. Members have to decide whether to stay with the current scheme - which will fall into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) - or move into a new scheme. Workers also have the option of transferring out into a personal pension scheme. Concerns about tight timescales and poor financial advice have led to calls from Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock for the deadline to be extended. However, Mr Johnston said that would not be possible, as any delay would lead to difficulties in the future which might lead to the pension scheme becoming unviable. More than 25,000 members of the scheme have so far failed to respond with their decision, and if they do not do so by 22 December, their pension will automatically be placed in the PPF. Mr Johnston said this raised concerns, because for more than 99% of pensioners, the new BSPS would be a better option. He accepted that the trustees had failed to anticipate the large numbers of steelworkers who had decided to transfer out of the pension scheme, and the consequent demand this had placed on help lines. Mr Johnston apologised for the delays and frustration this had caused. Serious concerns have been raised about a so-called ""feeding frenzy"" of financial advisors who have descended on steel works across the UK. After intervention by the Financial Conduct Authority, several advice firms are no longer allowed to give pensions advice to new customers. The BBC has learnt that the scheme trustees are putting in place a process that will allow workers who used these firms to withdraw any pending requests to transfer out of the scheme. Meanwhile, the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee has written to two companies - regulated financial adviser Active Wealth and unregulated introduction firm Celtic Wealth - who failed to attend last week's inquiry hearing on the British Steel Pension Scheme. It wants a response to a series of questions by 8 January. Frank Field MP, committee chairman, said: ""Transferring out of a gold-plated final salary pension is generally a terrible idea, except in very particular circumstances.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Japan whaling ban welcomed in Australia and New Zealand,"The International Court of Justice ruled that the programme was not for scientific research as Japan claimed. Supporters of the ban say they are ""delighted"". Japan said it would comply with the judgement, but was ""deeply disappointed"". Australia brought the case to the court in 2010. Wellington supported its case. Announcing the judgement on Monday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said that Japan had killed around 3,600 minke whales since 2005 under its Antarctic whaling programme, known as JARPA II. While JARPA II could broadly be characterised as ""scientific research"", the scientific output from the programme was limited, and Japan had not sufficiently justified the whaling quotas it had set, the ICJ said. 'Vindicated' During the court case, Australia argued that Japan's programme was commercial whaling in disguise, but Tokyo said the suit was an attempt to impose Australia's cultural norms on Japan. Following the ruling, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he was ""delighted by the result"", while former environment minister Peter Garrett said the ruling vindicated the then government's decision to take the case to court. The 2010 court ruling was first brought by Mr Rudd's Labor government. Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis welcomed the decision and said he thought relations between Australia and Japan would not suffer as a result. Prime Minister Tony Abbott is due in Japan later this month for trade talks. The ruling was also welcomed in New Zealand, which supported Australia's case at the ICJ. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he expected Japan to abide by the ""decisive"" court ruling. Japan had ""always acknowledged the international rule of law"", Mr Key told 3News on Tuesday. Anti-whaling activist group Sea Shepherd said: ""We've been saying for 10 years that this is an illegal whale hunt and the court has proven that case."" 'Important food' On Tuesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that Tokyo would consider its response ""after carefully examining the contents of the ruling"". ""We want to accept this from a position that respects the international legal order,"" he said. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that whale meat was ""an important source of food, and the government's position to use it based on scientific facts has not changed"". Japan can continue whaling if it revises its scientific programme, or withdraws from the International Whaling Commission. Japan is a signatory to a 1986 moratorium on whaling, but had continued whaling under provisions that allowed for scientific research. Norway and Iceland rejected the provision and continued commercial whaling. The moratorium also excludes subsistence whaling among indigenous groups, although catch limits are set.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
HIE takes control of CairnGorm Mountain,"CairnGorm Mountain Ltd (CML) was placed into administration last month due to ""unsustainable cash-flow problems"". Its parent company, Natural Retreats, had a 25-year lease to run the site near Aviemore. Staff and other assets will transfer to the new company, which will trade as Cairngorm Mountain (Scotland) Limited. The new company will honour season tickets purchased for this winter season. HIE already owns the site, but had leased it to an outside operator. It has now been sold the business and assets of CML by the administrators, Campbell Dallas. 'Protect jobs' The agency has contracted support from accountancy firm, Scott Moncrieff, to include a business turnaround specialist as interim chief executive to run the firm until the end of March. Charlotte Wright, HIE chief executive, said the immediate focus of the new operating company was to ensure the best possible experience for visitors this winter. She said: ""The deal that we've reached will protect jobs and bring stability to the business, which plays an important role in the wider local economy."" Blair Milne, joint administrator and business recovery partner with Campbell Dallas, said the deal ensured continuity of operations and employment at CairnGorm Mountain. The funicular railway has been out of action since September because of a structural problem. Built at a cost of £26m and opened in 2001, it carries about 300,000 visitors each year, Specialist engineers have been carrying out a detailed structural assessment. A report on their investigation is expected later this month. CairnGorm Mountain: Challenges and opportunities Situated high in the Cairngorms near Aviemore, CairnGorm Mountain and its funicular railway has been owned by the public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise since 2008. In 2010, HIE was criticised by MSPs for failures which led to spiralling construction and running costs of the railway. HIE provided £19.42m towards the £26m cost of the funicular, which opened in 2001. Wilmslow-headquartered Natural Retreats bid for and won a 25-year lease to operate CairnGorm Mountain in 2014. The company has been running the site through the business CairnGorm Mountain Ltd. The following year, Natural Retreats began consulting on a planned, estimated £15m revamp of the centre. However, over the years it has been criticised for how it has run the snowsports centre, including for a decision to remove ski tows from an area called the Ciste. Last year, Aviemore Business Association announced a proposal to mount a community buyout of CairnGorm Mountain. This effort is now being led by Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust. This year has seen a structural problem shut down the funicular, and the publication of a vision that included adding new ski tows and mountain rollercoaster ride. HIE said realising the ambitions set out in the vision would require £27m investment.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
AMs' report highlights gaps in muscular dystrophy care,"The cross-party group for muscular dystrophy argues that an extra £470,000 should be invested for the estimated 3,400 people in Wales who have one of the more than 60 different types of muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular conditions. It says that it would, in turn, save the Welsh NHS nearly £4m a year in emergency hospital admissions. The research has been backed by families affected by muscular dystrophy including Ray Thomas from Neath, who lost two sons to muscular dystrophy, and after whom the report is named. The AMs report followed a nine-month inquiry and is due to be presented to Health Minister Edwina Hart later. Giving evidence to the group, Mr Thomas said his son, Leighton, 43, who died in March from Becker muscular dystrophy, was failed by the NHS. Six years before his brother, Robert, who was 39, died from the same condition, which affects only males. Mr Thomas believes both his sons could have lived up to another 10 years if they had received the care they needed. ""Two weeks before Leighton died, I had to make a phone call to England to see if I could take my son to a specialist clinic,"" he said. ""By the time the answer came back, yes, Leighton had deteriorated. He couldn't make it. ""If we had the clinicians in Wales, for adults, I honestly believe that Robby's and Leighton's life could have been extended. Leighton spent the last 11 years of life in a wheelchair. This Mr Thomas says was due to a lack of physiotherapy. Chair Dai Lloyd AM said: ""It was clear from the evidence gathered throughout the inquiry that specialist care can reduce emergency admissions. ""Health boards in Wales must recognise this - by working together and sharing the costs of a neuromuscular service, the NHS can save money."" NHS Wales is pledged to hosting two care advisers, one in north and one in south Wales. Recruitment is under way but no-one is yet in post. Nic Bungay, of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said: ""In January we were shocked by Ray's story of his son Leighton having spent 11 years without ever leaving his wheelchair. ""Now that story is all the more tragic because Leighton passed away without ever having seen the better care his parents are still fighting so hard for. ""We hope the health minister and NHS Wales will take notice of the huge inequality Welsh muscle disease patients are facing.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mitsubishi Motors: How did it falsify its fuel economy data?,"The inaccurate tests involved 157,000 of its own cars - the ek Wagon and eK Space - as well as 468,000 vehicles produced for Nissan - the Dayz and Dayz Roox. What has Mitsubishi done? Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test. Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. Mitsubishi: Cars, aircon, fridges and nuclear? Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. Has Mitsubishi been involved in any other scandals in the past? It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades. Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NHS: Reform message was screwed up - health minister,"Anna Soubry has admitted making the comment during a private session at a health conference, just days after taking up her new ministerial post. But in a statement, she clarified the remark and said she backed the reforms. ""More could have been done"" to explain the benefits and ""encourage support"" from health professionals, she said. Under the government plans, GPs and other clinicians are to be given more responsibility for spending the budget in England, while greater competition with the private sector will be encouraged. A host of health groups - including some royal colleges which set professional standards as well as the major unions representing doctors, nurses and midwives - were against the reforms. 'Out of context' In a written statement released by the Department of Health, the minister denied being opposed to the changes themselves. ""I have always been very supportive of the reforms, and anyone suggesting otherwise is taking my comments out of context,"" Ms Soubry, Conservative MP for Broxtowe. ""We could have done more when the plans were set out initially to explain the benefits for patients, and encourage the support of health professionals. ""That is exactly why we took the rare step last year of pausing the legislation and holding a listening exercise."" Ms Soubry was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the former Health Minister Simon Burns at the time the NHS changes were going through Parliament. Responding to the minister's remarks, Labour's shadow health minister Jamie Reed accused the government of being ""completely out of touch if they think the only problem with their NHS plans is one of presentation. He said: ""The government rammed through its wasteful £3bn re-organisation in the face of overwhelming public and professional opposition - these comments will do nothing for patients suffering because of the chaos David Cameron has created in the NHS."" It is not Ms Soubry's first controversial remark since being appointed in this month's government reshuffle. A few days after she got the job she hit the headlines after telling the Times it was ""ridiculous"" that assisted suicide is illegal in the UK. She said it was ""ridiculous and appalling"" that Britons had to ""go abroad to end their life"". The Department of Health later said the views were Ms Soubry's own, and the Ministry of Justice said there were no plans for the government to change the law.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boeing 787 Dreamliner: NTSB details battery fire,"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident in Boston on 7 January. In its ""interim factual report"", released alongside hundreds of pages of related documents, the NTSB said it was still looking into the probable cause. All 50 Dreamliners in operation have been grounded. Hissing loudly Minutes after the Boeing 787 aircraft landed at Boston's Logan International Airport from Tokyo's Narita, cleaning staff discovered smoke near a kitchen at the back of the plane, the report said. A mechanic investigating the area in the electronics bay ""found heavy smoke and fire coming from the front of the auxiliary power unit battery case"". There were two distinct flames about three inches in length at the front of the battery case, the report said. Airport security footage showed smoke coming out of the plane. An aircraft rescue and fire fighting captain reported the battery was hissing loudly and liquid was flowing down the sides of the battery case. He received a burn on his neck when, in his words, the battery ""exploded"". After repeated attempts to put out the flames, the battery was removed from the aircraft. The report said the situation was ""controlled"" one hour and 40 minutes after the initial notification. Several reasons have been given as to why the lithium ion batteries used in the Dreamliner could emit smoke, including short circuits, however the report said only overcharging would cause it to burn. In a separate incident on 16 January on board an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight, smoke was reported coming from the plane's battery but no flames. Fuel-efficient The ANA plane was forced to make an emergency landing, and that led to the grounding of all Dreamliners in operation. The Dreamliner is the first plane in the world to use the lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, hold more power and recharge more quickly. Boeing says the aircraft is 20% more fuel-efficient than similar sized airliners, a selling point for airlines for whom fuel costs are their biggest operational expense. Airlines that operate Dreamliners have been forced to find alternatives for scheduled flights in their fleets. Some have said they will seek compensation from Boeing for the losses arising from keeping the Dreamliners grounded.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Labour pulling up ladder on working people, says Davies","He accused Labour ministers, ""hand-in-hand with nationalists"", of ""pulling up the ladder on hard working people"". A bill to abolish the Thatcher-era policy was published on Monday. Later at the event, Prime Minister Theresa May set out her desire to create a ""more united"" Britain. If follows Nicola Sturgeon's demand for a second independence referendum for Scotland. Mr Davies told fellow party members on Friday that the right-to-buy policy had ""allowed generations of people to get on in life and buy their own home"". ""You only have to look at Wales if you want to see the devastating impact of policies wanted by the likes of Jeremy Corbyn can have on hardworking people,"" he said. ""A Labour Party, hand in hand with the nationalists, pulling up the ladder on people who just want to get on in life and support their family."" The Welsh Conservative leader used the conference to send a message to nationalists who want ""to tear the union apart"". He said Brexit was a ""significant opportunity to create a fairer Wales and a better Britain"". ""The United Kingdom that we cherish is not a thing of the past,"" he said. ""It remains - as ever - the world's greatest family of nations ""Nicola Sturgeon, take note: This great union is here to stay."" 'Power without responsibility' He also attacked Labour's handling of public services in Wales. But his speech made no mention of last year's assembly election result, when the Tories lost three seats, coming third behind Labour and Plaid Cymru. Criticising the deal between Plaid and Labour in the assembly which allowed Carwyn Jones to be re-nominated as first minister, Mr Davies said it was time for ""Labour's crutches to be taken away"". Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood had chosen ""power without responsibility"", he said. Mr Davies began his speech with a nod to his last appearance at a Tory conference when he confused Brexit with breakfast: ""the meal which made me go viral for all the wrong reasons"". Continuing the attacks on Plaid and the SNP, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns accused nationalist politicians of ""constructing barriers where they simply don't exist"". ""But the case for the union is not only emotional; it's logical, sensible, and practical,"" he said. ""Put simply, we achieve more together. This isn't political rhetoric, it's common sense.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Flat-dwelling children exposed to neighbours' smoke too,"Researchers from Harvard and Rochester Universities say that is because the smoke seeps through walls and shared ventilation systems. They tested cotinine levels in blood samples from 5,000 children across the US for the study in Pediatrics. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said there was a ""strong case"" for making blocks of flats smoke free. Researchers limited the sample in this study to children who live in a household where nobody smokes. They looked for cotinine - a product of nicotine and a highly sensitive marker for tobacco - in the children's blood. The study found that 73% of the 5,000 children analysed were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke. Overall, researchers found that 84.5% of children who were living in blocks of flats had a cotinine level that indicated recent tobacco-smoke exposure, compared with 79.6% of children who were living in attached houses and 70.3% who were living in detached houses. Smoke trail Dr Jonathan Winickoff, study author and associate professor of paediatrics at Harvard Medical School, said: ""If your neighbours are smoking then you are exposed if you live through the wall in a semi-detached house. In apartment buildings this effect is magnified. Smoke contaminates the whole building."" ""This study is the last link in the chain of evidence. It demonstrates the overwhelming need for smoke-free buildings,"" he said. He continued: ""In years to come, people will shake their heads in disbelief that there was ever smoking in homes where children live, eat, sleep and breathe."" Previous research has shown that passive smoking is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, even at low levels of exposure. Karen Wilson, assistant professor of paediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Centre, said: ""Parents try so hard to protect their children from dangers, such as tobacco smoke. It's surprising to see these results and realise that too many parents have no control over whether their children are exposed to second-hand smoke in their own homes."" Martin Dockrell, director of policy and research at the UK group ASH, said: ""There is a strong case for social and private sector landlords designating some entire blocks as smoke-free to respect the choice and the health of the great majority of their tenants.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Romania protests: Thousands hold fresh rallies after clashes,"So far the protest near the government offices has been noisy but peaceful. Similar demonstrations are also reported in other cities including Cluj, Sibiu, Timisoara and Iasi. On Friday, more than 50,000 people took to the streets against what they described as entrenched corruption and low wages. Many of the demonstrators are Romanian expats who have returned from across Europe to voice their anger at the government. Several police officers were hurt on Friday as some protesters threw bottles and police used tear gas and water cannon. President Klaus Iohannis said the police reaction was ""disproportionate"". ""I firmly condemn riot police's brutal intervention, strongly disproportionate to the actions of the majority of people,"" he said. What happened in Bucharest on Friday? The demonstration was staged in front of the government headquarters in the city centre. The protesters were demanding the resignation of the government, objecting to the perceived efforts to weaken the judiciary by the governing Social Democrats (PSD). The violence began when some in the crowd tried to break into the government building - but were held back by the police security cordon. Other protesters were seen throwing paving slabs at the police, who responded with tear gas, pepper spray and water cannon. Police said they had acted in a proportionate way, responding to the violent behaviour of hooligans in the crowd. Ileana Anghel travelled all the way from her home in Spain with her husband to take part in the demonstration. ""We want to see modern roads and schools and above all to not have to pay bribes to the left and right,"" she told AFP. Vlad, 60, flew back to Romania from New York, his home of 30 years. ""Corruption and embezzlement, which profit the ruling class, are what bothers me,"" Vlad told the same news agency. According to the World Bank, up to a quarter of the Romanian population - between three and five million people - live and work abroad, sending back around $5bn (£3.9bn) to one of the EU's least developed countries. What's the background to this crisis? Protests have been building against the PSD for months. In July, President Iohannis approved the dismissal of anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had been leading corruption investigations into local and national politicians. Mr Iohannis had been under extensive pressure from the PSD government to agree to her removal. Around 150,000 gathered in Bucharest last year after the government passed a decree that could free those jailed on corruption charges.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jared O'Mara: MP's office investigated over security failure,"The BBC has learned the Sheffield Hallam MP's chief of staff, Gareth Arnold, was not vetted by Parliament. Mr Arnold, who is running the MP's office in his absence, had access to sensitive casework and the MP's email account on the parliamentary network. The House of Commons said it had taken steps to ""prevent unauthorised access to Mr O'Mara's parliamentary account"". During an investigation by BBC podcast, The Next Episode, Mr Arnold, 26, said: ""I am running a constituency office on behalf of an MP without the required security clearance from the parliamentary authorities. It's crazy isn't it?"" Mr O'Mara has said he is ""taking time out"" to deal with his ""mental health and personal issues"" after it emerged he sent sexually inappropriate messages to a female employee. The BBC also found constituents were being blocked on Twitter by Mr Arnold, who sent antagonistic responses and memes to their queries. Others say casework was not being dealt with, which Mr Arnold denies. He said: ""People have joked to me that I was basically the MP for Sheffield Hallam… that horrified me"". Since the BBC published the podcast, Mr O'Mara's Twitter account and website have been taken down and when the BBC visited his office on Monday morning, no-one was there. Sinead Parkinson, a founding member of the Hallam Constituents Facebook group, said: ""It's positive that Parliament are investigating the breach of security but it does not change the fact that Hallam constituents are still without an MP. ""His staff have evacuated the office, he has taken down his Twitter, and there is no phone or email communication. Action needs to be taken as we have no representation. ""Unless Jared O'Mara resigns we are left in this hopeless situation."" Tom Brake MP, who sits on the House of Commons commission in charge of the administration of the House, told the BBC: ""These are disturbing revelations. Whatever pressures MPs' offices are subject to, constituents are entitled to be treated with respect."" In July, Mr O'Mara announced plans to resign from his seat days after Mr Arnold publicly quit his role by posting his resignation statement on Mr O'Mara's Twitter account.

Eurotunnel accused of overcharging train companies,"The EC said both passengers and freight services are paying over the odds for using the track through the tunnel, which is operated by Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel is a private company owned by the investors who paid for and now run the Channel Tunnel. Eurotunnel said its charges are ""transparent and not excessive."" The EC has formally called on the British and French governments to look into the pricing structure and to comply with European Union rules against excessive track access charges. The European Commission said the high prices Eurotunnel charges the train companies get passed onto passengers. The EC also said that freight companies are put off using the Channel Tunnel because of the ""excessive"" charges, preferring to send their goods by road, which causes traffic congestion and pollution. The Commission claims 43% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity is currently unused. Vice-President of the European Commission Siim Kallas said: ""'The Channel Tunnel is not being used to its full capacity because of these excessive charges. ""As a result, more freight is being carried on lorries instead of by rail, freight operators and their customers are being over-charged, and passengers are paying over the odds for their tickets. The current regime is also stifling growth in the rail sector,"" he added. In a statement, Eurotunnel said that it has ""always sought the development of cross-Channel traffic and concentrates significant resources on this goal"". 'Weak regulator' The European Commission also said that the regulator which oversees the tunnel, the Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) is weak and far from independent. The Commission said the IGC ""does not have the power to adopt decisions on its own initiative without a complaint"". The EC added that the IGC is not an independent body, because it is made up of representatives appointed by the UK and French governments. In a statement, the European Commission said: ""Lack of independence of a rail regulator can lead to failure by the regulator to address complaints by operators in an independent manner or to adopt decisions to force compliance with EU rules and thus can lead to distortions of competition"". Reacting to the assertions of the Commission, a UK Department for Transport spokesman said that ""it is not accepted that the UK has failed to implement the relevant EU rules regarding the Channel Tunnel or that the IGC is not independent"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Trump won't scrap Nafta trade deal 'at this time',"Media reports on Wednesday had suggested Mr Trump was drafting an executive order to end the pact. During his election campaign Mr Trump called Nafta the ""single worst trade deal ever"" and a ""killer"" of US jobs. The reversal surprised markets, sending the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar higher after losses earlier this week. 'Disgrace' The White House said it had ""agreed not to terminate Nafta at this time"" and that the Mexican and Canadian leaders had ""now agreed to proceed swiftly to renegotiate... to enable the renegotiation of the Nafta"". Trump's trade agenda: Just what are his priorities? Mr Trump said: ""Well, I was going to terminate Nafta as of two or three days from now. ""The president of Mexico who I have a very very good relationship called me, and also the prime minster of Canada who I have a very good relationship, and I like both these gentlemen very much - they called me and they said rather than terminating Nafta, could you please renegotiate? ""I like them very much, I respect their countries very much, their relationship is very special and I said I will hold on the termination, let's see if we can make it a fair deal. Because Nafta's been a horrible deal for the United States."" Mr Trump's comments on Nafta come just days after the US imposed a new tariff on softwood lumber coming from Canada. He also called a new Canadian tariff regime affecting US dairy products a ""disgrace"". On Tuesday, the US lost a trade battle with the other Nafta signatory. The World Trade Organization ruled that Mexico could impose more than $160m (£125m) annually in sanctions against the US on commerce in tuna, capping a dispute dating back to 2008. Early in his presidency, Mr Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

Greta Thunberg: New beetle named after climate activist,"Nelloptodes gretae bears little resemblance to its namesake - it is less than 1mm long, and has no wings or eyes. The insect does, however, have two long pigtail-like antennae. Scientist Dr Michael Darby said he chose the name because he was ""immensely impressed"" by the Swedish teenager's environmental campaigning. N. gretae was first found in Kenya in the 1960s by William Block, who donated his samples to the Natural History Museum in London in 1978. It has been held in one of the museum's collections since. Dr Darby was studying this collection when he came across the then-nameless species. By naming the beetle after Ms Thunberg, he said, he ""wanted to acknowledge her outstanding contribution in raising awareness of environmental issues"". It has now been formally named in the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. Dr Max Barclay, the museum's senior curator in charge of beetles, said the name was apt because ""it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of biodiversity loss"". ""So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species,"" he added. Who else has an animal named after them? For scientists, naming a newly discovered species after themselves is simply not done - which means they need to be a bit more creative. This is how we now have a parasite named after Bob Marley (Gnathia marleyi), a genus of fish called after Richard Dawkins (Dawkinsia), and a small park's worth of species - both alive and extinct - named after Sir David Attenborough. Sometimes animals are named after celebrities the scientists admire, as with the N. gretae beetle, or a spider called Spintharus leonardodicaprioi. Other times, it's because the celebrity is known to have a particular fondness for that animal - as with the lemur named after John Cleese, Avahi cleesei. And sometimes the animals bear some resemblance to the celebrity they're named after. For example, there is a golden-haired fly named after Beyonce - Scaptia beyonceae. There is also a moth called Neopalpa donaldtrumpi which, biologist Vazrick Nazari said in 2017, is known for its distinctive blonde head. And just last year, Donald Trump had another animal named after him - an amphibian that buries its head in the sand. The Dermophis donaldtrumpi was so named because of the US president's comments about climate change. Unlike when you name a pet, however, scientific names last forever. There is perhaps no starker warning of the dangers of this than the Anophthalmus hitleri, a blind cave beetle doomed to forever be named after Adolf Hitler by a German admirer in 1933.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Portishead-Bristol line restoration gets funding boost,"The Portishead branch line shut in 1964 but is now part of a project which aims to reopen the line to passenger services by 2021. The scheme is being led by North Somerset Council and the West of England Combined Authority. The council said funding was confirmed by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. Council leader Nigel Ashton said: ""The Portishead line is vital for the town, north Somerset and the region."" ""The return of the rail link is essential to help reduce congestion on the A369...and will help the town continue to thrive and will bring great benefit to North Somerset and Bristol,"" he added. The Conservative-controlled council plans to submit a development consent order to the Department for Transport (DfT) in July. A DfT spokesman said: ""As with all major improvements on our railways, funding to support the delivery of the MetroWest will be fully considered subject to receiving a business case that demonstrates benefits for all users."" West of England mayor Tim Bowles said: ""This is excellent news for the region as we continue to work on our ambitious Metrowest rail plan which will help build a transport network that works for everyone."" Reopening the Portishead branch line is part of a wider £100m scheme investing in local rail projects by West of England councils. The DfT funding comes in addition to more than £15m already invested in the project by North Somerset Council. A previous funding bid to the government was rejected in 2018. The council said the total scheme amounted to £116.4m and had additional funding from the Local Growth Fund and Economic Development Fund. Richard Westwood, of North Somerset Labour Party, said: ""We have been demanding the government put their money where their mouth is and reopen the Portishead to Bristol line. ""It's been a long time waiting. But forgive us some scepticism this announcement comes just before an election."" North Somerset's Liberal Democrat group has been contacted for comment.

Difficult day for prime minister but not a disaster,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Rather in the manner of a boss telling staff who'd been caught bunking off that they would work extra hours, almost the first words out of the prime minister's mouth were that he did actually agree that the UK and the US would sign a trade deal after Brexit, and enthusiastically so. The president was not quite so effusive in his statements and betrayed frankly what many members of the public feel about the government's Brexit plans - ""I don't know what they're going to do but whatever you do is ok with me"". But he did, it seemed obediently, crank out the prepared line from his notes that the US was committed to doing a deal. Between now and next March you can bet you'll hear those remarks used as evidence by the prime minister of the UK's exciting future outside the EU again, and again, and again, oh and again. I'm sure you can picture the scene - whether an MP or a journalist asks, 'Prime Minister, this deal means it will be hard to do other trade deals', 'Donald Trump said the contrary, that the US was committed to work to seize the opportunities with a comprehensive deal'. That doesn't mean that's what will happen. Off script the president's doubts were pretty clear that for a trade deal to work the UK can't sign up to many restrictions. And while she denied it today, the prime minister and her colleagues well know that agreeing the 'common rule book' as we've discussed so much in the last week or so, does make the UK a less attractive trade partner for other countries. Indeed in officialese the government's own documents acknowledge as much. It is a decision that she has taken, that Donald Trump might not like much, but she has taken it for a reason. For the choreography of today though to be just awkward, not downright cringeworthy, it was important for Number 10 to pull Donald Trump back from his previous statements. He, true to form, tried to pretend that he hadn't really said what he said, even though his remarks were made on the record. 'Fake news', it was not. That is important to understand, because it means that the difficulties between our two countries over a tighter trading relationship have not disappeared. And for Theresa May, the bigger problem is that many in her party agree with him, not his world view, but the fact that her Brexit compromise could cut off some of what Leavers saw as the greatest possibilities of leaving the EU. This was a difficult day for the PM for sure, but not a disaster. But at a time when she desperately needs friends and allies, the American president is not necessarily one upon whom she can totally rely.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bonmarché appoints administrators,"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News The chain's 318 shops will remain open while a buyer is sought for the chain. Bonmarché chief executive Helen Connolly said she had made the decision with ""deep regret and sadness"", and blamed tough High Street trading conditions, and the Brexit delay. The Yorkshire-based chain, which specialises in clothing for the over-50s, employs 2,887 people. ""We have spent a number of months examining our business model and looking for alternatives. But we have been sadly forced to conclude that under the present terms of business, our model simply does not work,"" she added. She added the ""the drawn-out Brexit process"" had damaged sales. ""Without such a delay, it is feasible to believe that our issues would have been more manageable. Instead, it has only intensified the pressures,"" she said. Ms Connolly said the firm had considered a refinancing or a rescue deal, known as a company voluntary agreement (CVA) with its landlords and lenders. This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts and is often used as an opportunity to renegotiate rents. However, she said the firm had concluded that neither option would ""fundamentally change the core challenges facing the business"". ""We are sadly no longer in a position to demonstrate to our shareholders that the business can continue as a going concern,"" she added. The struggling retailer warned earlier this year that trading had deteriorated. UK billionaire and Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group owner Philip Day is the majority owner of the chain, with a 95% stake via his Dubai-based investment vehicle Spectre. Spectre said: ""We are disappointed with the result of our investment in Bonmarche, but our primary thought at this time is with the business' employees and families."" Administrator FRP Advisory said it had been appointed because the business was no longer able to meet its financial obligations. It emphasised that trading would continue and no redundancies had been made. ""There is every sign that we can continue trading while we market Bonmarché for sale and believe that there will be interest to take on the business,"" it said. Tough conditions Bonmarché is the latest retailer to be hit by tough conditions amid growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates. It has led to big names such as Toys R Us going into administration, while others such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, Debenhams and New Look have announced large-scale closures. Do you run a business?

Colombian government to negotiate with striking farmers,"President Santos invited strike leaders from the three worst-affected provinces to talks with key ministers in Bogota. The protests against the government's agricultural policies have created transport chaos in parts of Colombia. The government had said it would not meet the protesters until they lifted their road blocks. But speaking on Monday after meeting strike leaders in the central town of Tunja, President Santos said that he and his minsters ""were determined to confront the problems and work hand in hand with the farmers to see how we can get out of this situation"". He said he wanted to ensure that farmers had ""a decent income, could continue working the land and look forward to a future with more hope and optimism"". Widespread anger Eleven major roads continue to be blocked by the protesters, who include dairy farmers; potato, onion, rice and coffee growers; and lorry drivers. The protesters accuse the government of running the agricultural sector into the ground. They say that free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union are flooding the market with cheap imports while their costs for items such as fertilisers and fuel have gone up. The president of the National Union of Farm Workers, Ederto Diaz, said small-scale farmers were the worst-hit by the free trade agreements with the EU, which came into force this month, and with the US, which has been in force since last year. ""We're not going to leave this country to the big farmers, or the multinationals which are taking over the land,"" he said. Deadly clashes On Tuesday, 15,000 people marched through Tunja to show their support for the farmers, who say that they are facing bankruptcy unless the government gives them a price guarantee for their harvests. Over the past nine days, hundreds of thousands of farmers have been gathering in cities throughout Colombia, with the central provinces of Boyaca and Cundinamarca and southern Narino particular hotspots. President Santos said his ministers would discuss a number of measures aimed at easing the pressure on farmers, including easier access to loans, lowering the high cost of fertilisers and boosting prices for their products. He also said that there would be an investigation into allegations that riot police had beaten protesters and bystanders. Head of Police Gen Rodolfo Palomino also promised an inquiry into accusations of abuse of power by his officers. The general said 160 police had been injured and one officer shot dead policing the protests. The meeting between the ministers and protest leaders was scheduled to take place later on Tuesday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nuclear Posture Review: US wants smaller nukes to counter Russia,"The latest thinking was revealed in a Pentagon policy statement known as the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The US military is concerned Moscow sees US nuclear weapons as too big to be used - meaning they are no longer an effective deterrent. Developing smaller nukes would challenge that assumption, it argues. Low-yield weapons are smaller, less powerful bombs with a strength below 20 kilotons. They are still devastating, however. The atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki at the end of World War Two had about the same explosive power, and killed more than 70,000 people. ""Our strategy will ensure Russia understands that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is unacceptable,"" the document said. US Deputy Secretary of Defence, Patrick Shanahan, said the country's nuclear arsenal had kept it safe for over 70 years. ""We cannot afford to let it become obsolete,"" he told a media briefing in Washington. It is the first time since 2010 that the US military has outlined its perception of future nuclear threats. The proposed ""tactical"" nukes would not increase America's arsenal, which is already considerable, but would repurpose existing warheads. Nonetheless, critics have accused the Trump administration of challenging the spirit of non-proliferation agreements. The NPR also highlights the White House's concerns about North Korea, China and Iran. Good insurance, or a step towards nuclear war? Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent For the Trump Administration the goal of this review is to modernise and adapt the US nuclear arsenal for unsettled times. The three main elements of America's nuclear forces - land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and air-delivered weapons - are to be extensively modernised. These are programmes which actually began under the Obama Administration. What is new is the perceived need for two new types of nuclear weapons to provide - in the words of US officials - ""more flexible capabilities to give tailored deterrence"". These include the modification of some submarine-launched nuclear warheads to give a lower-yield or less powerful detonation, as well as bringing back sea-based nuclear cruise missiles. US officials insist that this makes the US deterrent more credible and thus actually raises the nuclear threshold. But critics worry that such weapons could blur the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear systems, and actually make a nuclear war more likely.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Egypt court upholds Muslim Brotherhood death sentences,"The men were convicted over the deaths of at least 11 officers in Kerdasa. The attack took place after Egyptian military forces cracked down on Islamist supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi that July. Hundreds of death sentences have been passed on Mr Morsi's supporters but none has been carried out. Human rights group Amnesty International says the death sentences follow grossly unfair trials and highlight Egypt's disregard for national and international law. Mr Morsi will face a new espionage trial on 15 February, Egypt's official Mena news agency says. He and 10 others will be charged with leaking ""classified documents"" to Qatar and Qatari-based broadcaster al-Jazeera. Mr Morsi is already facing three other trials, including another case of espionage. He too could be given the death penalty if found guilty. Appeal still possible More than 140 of the 188 defendants in the Kerdasa case are already in custody, while the rest have been sentenced in absentia. The court also sentenced a minor to 10 years in prison in the case, and two other defendants were acquitted. The verdict follows a recommendation by Egypt's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, but it can be appealed against. Last month, the death sentences of 37 people were overturned on appeal. The defendants had been convicted of attacking a police station in Minya, south of Cairo, on the same day as the Kerdasa attack. The violence came after security forces killed hundreds of people when they cleared protest camps set up in the capital by supporters of the ousted Islamist president, Mohammad Morsi. The original trial also saw some 377 people sentenced to life in prison in absentia. ""[The] death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the Egyptian criminal justice system,"" Amnesty's Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, said in a statement in response to Monday's verdict. ""These verdicts and sentences must be quashed and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and excludes the death penalty."" Mr Sahraoui said it would be wrong to impose capital punishment ""when there are serious doubts hanging over the fairness of the trial"" which ""outrageously flouted"" international law. The United Nations has called the mass trials ""unprecedented"". Mr Morsi was succeeded by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, a former military chief who has been heavily criticised for his crackdown on Islamists. Hundreds of people, mostly Islamists, have been killed since the army deposed Mr Morsi.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google employee anti-diversity memo causes row,"In an internal memo, a male software engineer argued the lack of women in top tech jobs was due to biological differences between men and women. ""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,"" he wrote in the piece which was widely criticised. But the author said he had received ""many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude"". Posted on an internal discussion board, the article was published in full by tech website Gizmodo. It argues that the ""abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership"". The unnamed author says women generally ""prefer jobs in social or artistic areas"" while ""more men may like coding"". The article prompted a response from the search engine giant's new head of diversity Danielle Brown, who said ""the heated debate"" over the issue had ""compelled"" her to say a few words. In an internal email, published by tech website Motherboard, she said the article was ""not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages"". ""Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the culture we continue to cultivate,"" she added. ""We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul."" On social media, women spoke out to criticise the memo and attitudes of sexism in the workplace more generally. In blog on the site Medium, former Google engineer Erica Baker said she was ""disappointed but unsurprised"". ""This is not entirely new behaviour... What is new is that this employee felt safe enough to write and share an 8 page sexist screed, internally,"" she wrote. A diversity report Google published in June showed that about 69% of its total workforce is male, and 56% are white. Women fill only 25% of leadership roles and 20% of technical jobs such as computer programmers. Wider concerns There have been complaints about a culture of sexism and lack of diversity in the technology sector more broadly. Several executives, including chief executive Travis Kalanick, quit Uber this year following claims the ride sharing firm had not done enough to tackle complaints about sexual harassment. And in June, Silicon Valley investor Justin Caldbeck took an indefinite leave of absence after he was accused of sexually harassing six female technology executives. ""The gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behaviour played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment,"" Mr Caldbeck wrote in a statement released at the time.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NSA 'tracking' hundreds of millions of mobile phones,"The data is said to help the NSA track individuals, and map who they know, to aid the agency's anti-terror work. The ""dragnet surveillance"" was condemned by digital rights groups who called for the NSA's snooping efforts to be reined in. The news comes as Microsoft plans to use more encryption to thwart NSA spying on it and its customers. Wrong target The huge database built up by the NSA (National Security Agency) keeps an eye on ""hundreds of millions"" of mobile phones, said the Post, adding that it let the agency map movements and relationships in ways that were ""previously unimaginable"". It added that the vast programme potentially surpassed any other NSA project in terms of its impact on privacy. Information about the programme was in papers released to the Post by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The spying agency is said to have accumulated so much data, about 27 terabytes according to leaked papers seen by the Post, that it was ""outpacing"" the NSA's ability to analyse the information in a timely fashion. The analysis, via a computer system called Co-Traveler, was necessary as only a tiny fraction of 1% of the data gathered was actually useful in its anti-terror work, said the paper. The analysis is so detailed that it can be used to thwart attempts to hide from scrutiny by people who use disposable phones or only use a handset briefly before switching it off. The vast majority of the information gathered is said to come from taps installed on mobile phone networks and used the basic location-information that networks log as people move around. Analysing this data helps the NSA work out which devices are regularly in close proximity and, by implication, exposes a potential connection between the owners of those handsets. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was ""staggering"" that the NSA could mount such a vast location-logging system without any public debate. The ""dragnet surveillance"" broke US obligations that require it to respect the privacy of foreigners and Americans. ""The government should be targeting its surveillance at those suspected of wrong-doing, not assembling massive associational databases that, by their very nature, record the movements of a huge number of innocent people,"" it added. The steady flow of information about the NSA's surveillance work has led Microsoft to take steps to protect itself and its customers from unwarranted scrutiny, it said in a blogpost. Brad Smith, Microsoft legal counsel, said government snooping was now as much of a security problem as computer viruses and other cyber-attacks. In response, Mr Smith said, Microsoft was expanding its use of encryption; would fight legal orders that stop it telling customers when their data is being sought and would allow a closer look at the code it develops to show there were no backdoors built in.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus pandemic 'costing councils £30m a month',"Andrew Morgan says the impact on councils has been ""huge"". The UK government has announced extra funding for English councils, and says the Welsh Government will get £95m as a result. The Welsh Government welcomed the funding and said it would be used to support public services and businesses. When the UK government spends money on devolved areas, like Saturday's local government announcement, that £1.6bn package generates funding for the Welsh Government via the Barnett formula - the mechanism for working out the share Wales should get. It is up to Welsh ministers what they spend the money on. Mr Morgan, who is also the Labour leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council said the revenue councils are missing out on includes income they normally generate from leisure centres, planning fees, parking income, rent of property, school dinner income and theatres, while costs have risen elsewhere. Many council tax and business rate payments have also been deferred. Mr Morgan said he welcomed the announcement from the UK government but said more money may be needed in the future. He said the Welsh Government's decision to give councils an advance on their main grant has helped cashflow. But he added: ""However, at the end of this crisis or at the end of the financial year there will be a hole in our funding if we don't get more."" ""That's something the Welsh Government recognises and we have jointly called on the UK government to make good on budget shortfalls in-year. ""We should not have to introduce more cuts to fund this and there is a joint lobby across the UK including Welsh and Scottish governments, that further funding will be needed from the U.K. chancellor."" Announcing the additional money for Wales following the English local government investment, Welsh secretary Simon Hart said: ""The UK government continues to do whatever it takes to ensure that everyone in Wales is able to access the support they need. ""This extra £95m will help the Welsh Government deliver vital services to help people get through the pandemic."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Obviously we welcome this additional funding which will enable us to boost our central fund to support public services and businesses to cope with the coronavirus crisis. ""We have already allocated £110m additional funding to local government, including the £40m announced yesterday to strengthen social care.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
St Helier Hospital cuts: Fun day protest against plans,"The demonstration against the plans for St Helier Hospital has been arranged by residents and Sutton Council. Organiser Karen Russell said closing ""its most vital departments is crazy and it has made people really angry"". NHS South West London said no decision would be made until local people had been consulted. The Better Services, Better Value (BSBV) panel, which is made up of local people, GPs and managers, is looking at ways to improve efficiency. Ideas being looked at include closing specialist children's wards and replacing them with a centre for planned surgery. St George's, Croydon and Kingston hospitals and other nearby hospitals would then take displaced St Helier patients. BSBV said across all four hospitals, costs need to be reduced by £321m by 2016-17, a saving of 29%. 'Damage to hospital' The fun day on the green outside the hospital has activities including bouncy castles, skateboard displays and face painting. Speeches against the cuts have also been taking place. Ms Russell, a local mother who started the Save St Helier Facebook group, said the fun day was a ""great day out with a real purpose"". ""Everyone knows we need St Helier Hospital,"" she said. ""This is our chance to come together and show we won't put up with any damage to our hospital,"" she added. Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam, who lost his job as a health minister this week, said he would now devote more time to campaign to save the services. Sutton Council leader and St Helier campaigner Ruth Dombey said: ""First and foremost I want everyone to come along and have a great day out. ""But while you're there take the time to find out what they plan to do to our hospital and then sign the petition and join the fight."" Dr David Finch, local GP and joint medical director for BSBV, said: ""We are still some way from a decision on the future shape of health services in south-west London."" He added: ""Any recommendations have to be agreed by the local NHS and then would go out to full public consultation later in the year. ""Everyone will have the opportunity to have their say and no decision will be taken until local people have been consulted.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gambling: Tougher new rules for 'bet now' adverts,"The new rules, which will restrict adverts during live events, aim to protect ""vulnerable"" gamblers, the Committee of Advertising Practice said. CAP, which writes advertising rules, said the new standards will also target ambiguous offers for free bets. It comes as gambling firm ElectraWorks was fined £350,000 for misleading ads. GVA, which owns ElectraWorks and brands including Foxy Bingo, said the adverts have been withdrawn and all its offers have since complied with the rules. Announcing the new restrictions, CAP said it will restrict any adverts that encourage repetitive play or irresponsibly suggest ""risk free"" deposits. The updated rules, which will be used by the Advertising Standards Authority in its decisions on complaints, will also ban adverts that play on customers' financial concerns or self-esteem. The new standards will come into force on 2 April - except for the restrictions on free bets, which apply immediately. Free bets CAP said the majority of complaints over gambling adverts relate to consumers being forced to make deposits before they can access their free bets or withdraw their winnings. It said all free bet and bonus offers must now state the terms and conditions prominently. Any money-back offers must also be made in cash and not bonuses. Shahriar Coupal, director of CAP, said: ""We won't tolerate gambling ads that exploit people's vulnerabilities or play fast and loose with eye-catching free bet and bonus offers. ""Our new guidance takes account of the best available evidence to strengthen the protections already in place, ensuring that gambling is presented responsibly, minimising the potential for harm."" You may also like: The industry-wide crackdown comes as online gambling business ElectraWorks was fined £350,000 by the Gambling Commission for repeatedly misleading consumers with free bonus adverts. The brand ran an advert on its betting website Bwin offering to match any deposit of up to £30 for free. But one consumer's complaint, which was upheld by the ASA, found they had to wager £102 before their matched bonus was released. A week later, the Gambling Commission discovered six similar breaches. GVC, the online gambling firm behind ElectraWorks, said it welcomed the regulator's findings. A statement said: ""When we fall short of those standards we believe the right thing to do, is to acknowledge the fact, correct the problem and then ensure that we have taken every necessary precaution to ensure there is no repetition."" Gary Gillies, Managing Director of Big Free Bet, said: ""We take our position as online betting companies very seriously and we don't want to mislead anyone. ""The terms of special offers and free bets should be really clear for consumers, but we also have to be careful that the rules and regulations surrounding our industry are not completely over the top.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
M4 relief road judicial review rejected,"Friends of the Earth Cymru had wanted a judge to examine how ministers reached their decision on the £1bn project. The group, which is worried nature reserves will be damaged, said it was ""disappointed"" and would continue making the case against the road. The Welsh government has insisted the decision had been ""carefully considered"". Three firms have already been awarded the contract to start work on the project around Newport. Friends of the Earth had raised three grounds for concern: Sitting in the High Court, Mr Justice Hickinbottom rejected the review. Gareth Clubb, director of Friends of the Earth Cymru, said: ""Naturally we're disappointed by the conclusions of this judicial review. But the case against the M4 gets stronger by the day. ""Just yesterday a report was published by the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research that said 'it is difficult to envisage how the M4 relief road can be justified."" A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""We welcome the judge's ruling. We believe this is the best solution to transport issues around Newport and that it is vitally important to the economic prosperity of Wales."" Analysis by BBC Wales environment correspondent Iolo ap Dafydd This is a significant decision which now may well lead to the new relief road being built. The fact that the Welsh government on Wednesday announced three contracts for preliminary works underlines the confidence of ministers and civil servants. Friends of the Earth Cymru argued that conservation sites would be damaged and reasonable alternatives hadn't been fully explored by the Welsh government. But the judge said their case had ""fallen very far short"" and it was up to the government to decide on the merits of where to build the road, or if it would sacrifice part of the Gwent Levels. Environment groups question building a new stretch of the M4, with a projected increase of traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. They argue this is at odds with the Welsh government's repeated climate change commitment - which is to reduce emissions by 3% per year and 40% by 2020. Ministers argue a new M4 will reduce congestion and emissions and make Wales ""more resilient to the effects of climate change"". Last week, it passed legislation on sustainable development - the Well-being of Future Generations Bill. That requires all public bodies to embed climate change into their decision-making. So how does the M4 relief road fit in with that thinking? The answer, I guess, would be about taking a broader view.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish government offers help to job loss BAE workers,"Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be next week before the firm clarified which jobs would go. She said that once this happened the government would target help to affected staff at Govan and Scotstoun. Ms Sturgeon was speaking after she and Finance Secretary John Swinney met BAE management and unions at Scotstoun. She described the talks on Friday morning as constructive and said the Scottish government was ready to help. Support message ""The principal focus of the discussion this morning was on what support the Scottish government can bring to bear to those affected by redundancy in the weeks and months to come,"" she said. ""We have well-established arrangements to help people affected by redundancy find alternative employment, to help them access retraining and reskilling, so we wanted to give a very strong message that that support is there. ""On the upside, this is a highly skilled workforce and we know there are other companies out there who have a demand for these kind of skills. So it's going to be very important for the government to do what it can, in addition to what the company will already do, to match up those skills with the demand that there might be for them."" Ms Sturgeon said there were engineering firms around Scotland that have a demand for the kind of skills the Glasgow shipyard workers have. She added: ""There are discussions in the early part of next week between the company and the unions where I think we will start to hear some of the detail of the breakdown of the job loss number. ""Obviously that detail is important to those affected but it also allows the government to know where the support that we can offer can best be targeted."" BAE Systems confirmed on Wednesday that it planned to cut 1,775 jobs at its UK yards. The firm said 940 staff posts and 170 agency workers will go at its Portsmouth site, where shipbuilding will end. Some 835 jobs will be lost across its yards in Govan and Scotstoun, Rosyth in Fife, and at the firm's Filton office, near Bristol. To offset the job losses, BAE and the Ministry of Defence announced that three new ocean-going offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy would be built at Govan and Scotstoun. This was aimed at sustaining shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 global combat ships, sometime after 2014.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
