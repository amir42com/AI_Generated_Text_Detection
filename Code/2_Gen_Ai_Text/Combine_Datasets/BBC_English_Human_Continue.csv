"'Prison was holiday camp compared to forced labour', court hears","Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and Lee Carbis, 34, deny several offences. They allegedly kept Michael Hughes, 46, and another man, 41, in ""appalling conditions"" and paid them tiny sums. Mr Hughes said he was ""bought"" by Mr Connors senior. On Wednesday, Aberdeen-born Mr Hughes said Mr Connors senior made him live in a 1.2m (4ft) wide garden shed with no heating or running water for two years. He sobbed while giving evidence, saying he had to work long hours for as little as Â£5 a day - even with a broken leg - and would get beatings ""all the time"". Mr Hughes said he was given brief respite from his ordeal after being sent back to Scotland for unpaid fines before being jailed. 'Come after me' ""Prison was like a holiday camp,"" he said. ""I had three meals a day. I had a shower, a telly, heating. I did not really care about my freedom. ""I had to go back down to Wales when I was released. Paddy (Mr Connors senior) told me to ... because he would come after me again."" Mr Hughes, who was taken into care at the age of three, said he left northern Scotland and came to Wales in search of a better life. However, after a brief stint doing building work for a man called Johnny Wall his services were acquired by a family in the Marshfield area before being ""passed onto"" the Connors. He said: ""I think he (Mr Connors senior) bought me."" 'Vulnerable' On Tuesday, a jury heard Mr Hughes and his fellow alleged victim - who cannot be named but has been referred to in court as Mr K - were ""hunted down"" whenever they escaped. All four defendants deny one count of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2013. Patrick Joseph Connors, of Rumney, Cardiff, has also pleaded not guilty to eight counts of causing actual bodily harm, four of kidnap and one of conspiracy to kidnap. His elder son Patrick Dean Connors, of Rumney, denies kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap. Younger son William Connors, also of Rumney, has pleaded not guilty to causing actual bodily harm on a man between 2009 and 2013. Patrick Joseph Connors' son-in-law Lee Carbis, of Trowbridge, Cardiff, also denies one count of kidnap between 2001 and 2002. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Delhi rape: PM promises to pursue panel recommendations,"Manmohan Singh wrote to the panel's head, ex-chief justice JS Verma, saying the report would be taken up promptly. The commission called for faster trials and longer sentences for convicted rapists, but not the death penalty. The brutal gang-rape on a Delhi bus caused outrage across the country. Last week, Justice Verma said his three-member commission had received 80,000 responses from India and abroad on how to reform rape laws. But not a single Indian state police chief had sent recommendations. He also criticised the way India is governed and said the authorities had failed in their duties to the public. 'Labour of love' ""I assure you that we will be prompt in pursing the recommendations of the committee,"" the prime minister wrote in a letter released to the press on Wednesday. He also thanked the three-member panel for their ""labour of love"" in completing the work of the committee ""our government had constituted to recommend amendments in law to be able to deal effectively with cases of sexual assault of extreme nature against women"". The three-member committee, which was given one month to submit its report to the government, included retired justice Leila Seth and former Solicitor General Gopal Subramanian. They handed in their 630-page report on 23 January in which they suggested amendments to criminal laws to provide for higher punishment to rapists. The brutal assault on the 23-year-old woman on 16 December shocked India and sparked a debate about the treatment of women. The student, who cannot be named in India for legal reasons, was attacked after boarding a bus in south Delhi with a male friend. Police said the assailants beat both of them, and then raped the woman. She suffered massive internal injuries and died nearly two weeks later. The incident led to nationwide protests against the treatment of women in India. Campaigners called for tougher rape laws and reforms to the police, who have been accused of often failing to file charges against attackers. Six suspects were arrested for the crime. Five of the accused are on trial at a specially convened fast-track court in Delhi. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. A sixth suspect, who is 17 years old, is to be tried by a juvenile court. The government has said it will bring in stronger sexual assault laws and has established several committees to recommend changes. It has also promised to fast-track future rape cases. Legal proceedings in India sometimes involve years of delays.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vulnerable adult abuse cases in Wales rise by 11%,"There were 4,485 completed adult protection referrals in 2015-16, up from 4,040 in 2014-15. Neglect (36%) and physical abuse (32%) were the most reported cases. The Welsh Government, which compiled the data, said the rise could be down to better reporting of incidents. Other types of reported abuse included emotional and psychological, financial and sexual. The figures showed 65% of investigations were for people aged 65 and over, and 61% were for women. Nearly 40% of victims who alleged abuse were targeted in their own home, while staff were most likely to be responsible (56%) followed by relatives (23%). Age Cymru said the figures for those aged 65 and over were ""completely unacceptable"". ""Elder abuse can happen anywhere - in people's homes, in the street, in shops, in cafes or in care settings,"" Age Cymru spokesman Iwan Rhys Roberts said. ""It's really important that we're all aware of elder abuse and what it is so that we can report it when we see it happening, or importantly, if we suspect it is taking place."" Welsh Women's Aid said the statistics highlighted ""the gendered nature of violence and abuse and the cross over with other equality characteristics such as age and disability"". ""It is vital that support services for vulnerable adults are trained to identify domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women and have an understanding of the complexities older women and women with disabilities face,"" a spokeswoman for the charity said. ""Welsh Women's Aid is currently delivering 'Ask and Act' training to health and other public sector professionals that will hopefully help them to identify vulnerable women who are at risk or are experiencing abuse earlier and ensure they are signposted to the specialist support they need."" A Welsh Government spokesman said it would explore the data with partners to establish why there has been a small rise in numbers. ""It could be due to better reporting generally as organisations were preparing for the introduction of the legal 'duty to report' adults at risk in April 2016,"" he added. ""However, we must remain vigilant and ensure measures are taken to prevent abuse and neglect. ""The Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act implemented from last April strengthens arrangements to safeguard children and adults, and this data will be important to take this work forward.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Call for commissioner to fight for autism and learning disability rights,"The three charities behind the campaign say families are exhausted from fighting to get much-needed support and status as equal citizens. They say a commissioner would close the current gap between what the law says and what actually happens in reality. The Scottish government said it would ""explore further"" the potential role. The charities - Enable Scotland, National Autistic Society Scotland and Scottish Autism - have said they hear every day of people struggling to access their rights to education, work, a family life, healthcare and high-quality social care services. They also said there was also a problem of discrimination against the 56,000 autistic people and 120,000 people with a learning disability in Scotland. The charities believe that appointing a commissioner - the first of its kind in the world - would reassure those with learning difficulties and autism that they mattered. It would also be powerful voice advocating on their behalf with public bodies who have a duty provide equal access to services and support. 'It can enact changes' Broadcaster Stuart Cosgrove, whose son is autistic, told BBC Scotland the role was important both symbolically and practically. He said: ""Symbolically in the sense that it raises autism further up the knowledge chain so that we become more aware of it and more able to adapt to it. ""But it is important in the sense that it can enact changes in law, changes in how local councils behave or allocate spend."" Laura McConnell, who works with autistic children and has autism herself, said: ""A lot of people have heard of autism but they don't necessarily understand in depth or their understanding might not be accurate. ""That can sometimes lead to bullying, to misunderstandings or to judgement of people."" She said tackling bullying was something an autism commissioner could prioritise. Lucy McKee, who is now 21 and has a learning disability, said life at school was hard. ""They called me names and all just ignored me,"" she said. ""It made me feel invisible so I decided I was going to do something about this. ""I spoke to my headteacher and said I wanted to speak to the whole school about having a learning disability."" According to Enable Scotland, fewer than 7% of people with learning disabilities have a job and that figure has not changed or improved for a decade. They also have worse outcomes in health and education. Lucy said she would love to have a job and her own home. ""I would love to have that bit of independence I have always wanted,"" she said. The Scottish government said: ""We will continue to consult with autistic people, people with a learning disability, and other stakeholders to explore further the potential role of a commission or commissioner, to understand more about the options, and how best to protect the rights of autistic people and people with a learning disability.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bath and Bristol streets exceed EU pollution levels,"By Luke Hanrahan BBC News Data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Council showed nitrogen dioxide levels were more than twice the EU limit in some roads. Bristol City Council said reducing the amount of traffic to meet the European target was ""difficult"". Nitrogen dioxide is a gas, emitted mainly by diesel vehicles, which can cause inflammation of the lungs. Highest levels In 1999, the European Union set an objective for every member state to lower nitrogen dioxide levels to fewer than 40 micrograms per cubic metre of air by 2010. Local councils have a responsibility to monitor air quality. This information is then made publicly available. In 2010, 90 Bristol streets out of 123 monitored by the council registered levels above the EU limit. Rupert Street, a busy bus route in the centre of Bristol, had the highest level of nitrogen dioxide, at 102.6 micrograms per cubic metre - more than twice the recommended European limit. Steve Crawshaw, air quality manager at Bristol City Council, said: ""In order to meet these targets there is only one way, and that is a drastic reduction in traffic. 'Unknown risk' ""And it's very difficult to meet that when people need to travel around. It's very difficult to know what we could do to meet those targets - there are no easy answers I am afraid."" Epidemiologist Dr Frank Kelly, from Kings College, London, said: ""We know it's a pollutant gas which has biological effects much along the lines of the other pollutants we know about that come out of the back of vehicle exhausts. ""At this point in time it's an unknown risk, it's unquantified - we need to be able to quantify the extent of damage that's occurring"". In Bath, 33 out of the 76 streets which were monitored, exceeded the limit. Lambridge, which leads to the city centre, had the highest level at 81 micrograms per cubic metre. Jo Holley, lives on London Road in Bath, which has a level of 49 micrograms per cubic metre. Talking about her twin eight-year-old daughters who both have asthma, she said: ""Asthma takes over our life really, particularly Molly's life at the moment. ""It really annoys me that the levels are extremely high - I think it's something that needs to be addressed as a country."" Claire Holman, from environmental consultancy, Environ, said: ""Twenty years ago we all thought that air quality was going to be improved, all the targets and limit values would be met. ""Yet we're in this position 20 years later where we still are some way off."" Last month, the government applied to the EU for an extension after it failed to meet the 2010 deadline to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
William Roache trial: Girl 'humiliated and ashamed after rapes',"The woman, now 62, told Preston Crown Court two alleged rapes took place at his homes in Haslingden, Lancashire, on separate occasions. She suffered depression for several years afterwards, the jury heard. Mr Roache, 81, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, denies two counts of raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967. He also denies five counts of indecent assault involving four girls. Those alleged offences involve girls aged 16 or under in Manchester between 1965 and 1971, the court heard. 'Buried for years' During cross-examination, the woman said she could not remember Mr Roache saying anything after the second alleged rape. She said she had been invited into the cottage but was under the impression that an elderly woman was living there. Louise Blackwell QC, defending, asked her if she was worried she was pregnant. The woman replied: ""I don't think I knew enough then. I didn't realise the implications. ""They didn't talk about those things in them days."" She added: ""I should have known that I should not have trusted him."" Asked what she did in the hours that followed the alleged attack, she said: ""I can't remember exact details, you just want to close your mind to them. ""I never thought that I would have to repeat them. I have buried these for 47 years."" Piers Morgan interview The woman agreed she changed her mind about her age at the time of the attacks. She initially said she was 14, although now states she was 15. Challenged by Miss Blackwell, who said the reason she got it wrong was that she was not telling the truth, the woman replied: ""Sometimes I can't remember what I said yesterday. ""I have not forgotten anything about the main events, believe me."" The woman said she had continued to watch Coronation Street after the alleged rapes as there was ""no threat when he is on television"". She told the court she watched an ITV Piers Morgan's Life Stories interview with Mr Roache which ""made her skin crawl"" when he discussed his love life. The court heard that the woman did not give her name when she first approached police. Asked why by prosecutor Anne Whyte QC, she said she was ""ashamed"", adding: ""I didn't want my name in the papers. I wasn't even sure it was confidential."" Giving evidence, her son said his mother opened up to him after a discussion about recent high-profile abuse cases. He said he was ""very angry"", but his mother ""frustrated"" him more. During the conversation, his mother told him Mr Roache was ""not a monster"" and had not physically hurt her. ""It made my blood boil because she was kind of defending him, if that makes sense"", he said. He told the court he was persistent in telling her to go to the police and admitted he was like ""a dog with a bone"". ""I said there could be other people like this"", he said. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London 2012: India 'to raise role of Dow Chemical',"The sports ministry told the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to convey its concerns, saying there was ""strong public sentiment"" on the issue. Dow has links to the firm behind the gas leak disaster in Bhopal in 1984. The IOA said it would ""make the organisers aware of the feelings of the people who have suffered"". Dow is funding a wrap around the Olympic stadium. 'World outcry' In a letter to the IOA, the sports ministry said: ""Strong public sentiment exists in this matter and a number of eminent ex-Olympians have also raised concerns. ""We would advise the Indian Olympic Association to raise this matter immediately with the IOC while keeping the government informed."" IOA acting president Vijay Kumar Malhotra had said last week the issue would be raised with the organisers. But he also said: ""There is no question of India boycotting the London Olympics. We are not boycotting the Olympic Games and that is very clear on the IOA's part."" On Monday in an IOA statement, Mr Malhotra said the IOA had ""received representations from several former Olympians and NGOs protesting against the London Games Organisers' link with Dow Chemical"". He said the issue would be discussed on 15 December. ""We will try to make the Games organisers aware of the feelings of the people who have suffered due to that tragedy. ""It is not only the Indians who are protesting this sponsorship, there has been an outcry against this world over from various NGOs and other bodies - it is no longer a local issue."" On Friday, the eve of the 27th anniversary of the disaster, scores of survivors burned effigies of Olympics organiser Lord Coe and Mr Malhotra. In 1999, Dow merged with the Union Carbide Corporation, whose subsidiary Union Carbide India ran the Bhopal pesticide plant where the disaster happened. The gas leak was one of the world's worst industrial disasters. The Indian government says more than 3,000 people died within days of the leak. It says that more than 15,000 have died since then. Campaigners say the death toll is as high as 25,000 and that the effects of the leak continue to this day. Dow has said in the past that its $470m (Â£288m) settlement for those affected by the tragedy is fair and final. The company insists that while the past must never be forgotten, its ""position as a Worldwide Olympic Partner"" represents its ""vision for the future"". Dow has said that although it ""never owned nor operated the [Bhopal] plant and the legal claims surrounding the incident were resolved in 1989, long before Dow acquired Union Carbide, we - along with the rest of industry - have learned from this tragic event and have helped to drive global industry performance improvements to ensure that such incidents never happen again"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poland profile - Overview,"There have been periods of independence as well as periods of domination by other countries. Several million people, half of them Jews, died in World War II. A new era began when Poland became an EU member in May 2004, five years after joining Nato and 15 years after the end of communist rule. It was the birthplace of the former Soviet bloc's first officially recognised independent mass political movement when strikes at the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980 led to agreement with the authorities on the establishment of the Solidarity trade union. The shoots of political freedom were trampled again 16 months later when communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law. But the movement for change was irreversible. Elections in summer 1989 ushered in eastern Europe's first post-communist government. The presence in the Vatican of Polish Pope John-Paul II was an important influence on the Solidarity movement throughout the 1980s. The Roman Catholic church remains a very potent force in Polish life. In the years between the end of communism and EU accession, power in Poland switched between the centre right and the centre left, but the 21st century has seen the rise of the more forthrightly conservative and Law and Justice Party. Success Poland has made major economic strides since the fall of communism, and especially since joining the EU. In 2009, when all the major European economies were contracting because of the credit crunch, Poland was the only country in Europe to experience economic growth. There has been marked success in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment. Germany is now Poland's biggest trading partner. There was a massive movement of workers to western Europe in the years after Poland joined the EU, but the exodus slowed down after the global economic crisis took hold. Poland still has a huge farming sector - agriculture accounts for about 60% of the country's total land area - but the sector remains hampered by inefficiency, structural problems and lack of investment. Warsaw's profile on the international stage was raised by its support for the US-led military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. More recently, it has found itself close to the front line in Russia's military campaign against Ukraine after the fall of that country's pro-Moscow government in 2014.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Eminem attacks Trump in freestyle rap at BET Hip Hop Awards,"The rapper calls him a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa"" and slammed fans who back the president during a four-and-half minute freestyle. ""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against,"" he raps in the film, shown during last night's BET Hip Hop Awards. Twitter users can't wait to see whether Mr Trump will respond. In the video for freestyle The Storm, Eminem is shown in a car park, stepping towards the camera to rap directly to viewers. ""If you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this,"" he says, raising a middle finger. The 44-year-old slams Trump for focusing on NFL players who ""take a knee"", and causing drama on social media. The rapper tweeted about his return to music. ""This is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada,"" he says. ""All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers."" The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, also calls the president racist. ""Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange."" And he praises former president Barack Obama. ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops,"" he says. American footballer Colin Kaepernick, basketball player LeBron James, Snoop Dogg and J. Cole are among those tweeting their appreciation for the freestyle. Basketball player LeBron James tweeted lyrics from the rap and #United. Snoop Dogg tweeted a joke picture of Donald Trump supposedly thinking up his response to the rap. J. Cole called Eminem a 'rap God'. But it didn't go down well with everyone. Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump, tweeted he'd lost respect for Eminem. Twitter user Alexander Bruesewitz said Mr Trump was bringing back jobs. This isn't the first time the Detroit rapper has criticised Mr Trump. Last year he released the nine-minute freestyle Campaign Speech in which he calls the president a ""loose cannon"" who ""doesn't have to answer to no-one"". Cardi B was the big winner at the BET Hip Hop Awards, taking five trophies including Single of the Year for Bodak Yellow. Kendrick Lamar took four awards, including Album of the Year and DJ Khaled, Nicki Minaj and JAY-Z were also successful.

Three teenagers arrive in Fiji after Pacific ordeal,"The boys, from the Tokelau Islands, a New Zealand-administered territory in the South Pacific, had been given up for dead after an unsuccessful search. The boys survived on coconuts, water they trapped on a tarpaulin and a seabird they managed to catch. Tanu Filo, the father of one of the boys, described the rescue as a ""miracle"". ""The whole village, they were so excited and cried and they sang songs and were hugging each other in the road. Everybody was yelling and shouting the good news,"" he told New Zealand radio. Meanwhile the head teacher of their school, John Kalolo, told BBC World TV there had been ""many tears of happiness and jubilation"" in the community over their rescue. He said when they were missing people still believed they were alive, but it was still unclear how they had ended up in this situation. ""There are many questions we need to ask these children - we're not sure of their motives and intentions,"" he said. Dehydration and sunburn A tuna fishing boat picked them up and took them to Fiji, where they were escorted into harbour by a New Zealand navy patrol and met by consular officials. They were taken to hospital for a thorough examination, suffering from severe dehydration and sunburn. The boys - Samu Perez and Filo Filo, both 15, and Edward Nasau, 14 - had gone missing from Atafu atoll in a small aluminium boat after an annual sporting event on 5 October. They were presumed to have died after unsuccessful searches by the New Zealand air force. The boys were then spotted north-east of Fiji on Wednesday afternoon by a member of the tuna boat's crew. ""We drew up next to them, and we asked if they needed any help and their reply was a very ecstatic 'Yes',"" the tuna vessel's first mate, Tai Fredricsen, told the BBC. ""We immediately deployed our rescue craft and got them straight on-board and administered basic first aid."" Mr Fredricsen said the boys had a small supply of coconuts on their boat, but that it had run out after two days. ""They had a period when they were only drinking fresh water, which they were capturing during the night in a tarpaulin,"" he said. ""They also told me that two weeks prior to us rescuing them, they were able to catch a sea bird which was very lucky for them."" ""They did mention that during the last two days they had started drinking salt water, which could have been disastrous for them,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift,"Larry Fink, who runs BlackRock, said the shift will happen ""sooner than most anticipate"". His company has announced ""sustainable"" versions of its traditional investment options to meet demand from clients. It has also said it would push firms to disclose more about a range of issues, including climate commitments. While markets have been slow to reflect the worries about climate change, Mr Fink said the corporate world is now catching up. ""Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,"" he wrote in an annual letter to chief executives. ""In the near future - and sooner than most anticipate - there will be a significant reallocation of capital."" In a letter to clients, BlackRock - which manages nearly $7tn in assets - said it was taking a number of steps to respond to the investment risks linked to climate change. In addition to the sustainable funds, it said its investors would be able to screen their portfolios for certain sectors. For actively managed funds, the company also plans to sell its holdings of companies that derive more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal production by mid-2020. 'Seriously consider sustainability' Even if only 5% of investors opt for sustainable strategies, it will still produce ""massive shifts"", Mr Fink said. ""The commitments we are making today reflect our conviction that all investors - and particularly the millions of our clients who are saving for long-term goals like retirement - must seriously consider sustainability in their investments,"" he wrote in the letter to clients. But, he added: ""The choice remains with you"". The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said BlackRock's announcements were a ""major step in the right direction"" that will put pressure on competitors to take similar steps. But the fund manager continues to hold sizable investments in coal, oil and gas. And the Sierra Club said it would be watching to see whether BlackRock flexes its shareholder muscle in upcoming climate-related votes at the companies it invests in. ""It is time to turn off the money pipeline to dirty fossil fuels for good,"" said Ben Cushing, the organisation's campaign representative. ""BlackRock should expand on its commitments and other financial institutions should follow suit."" Mr Fink's letter puts a spotlight on a growing trend among investors who worry about the industries they are funding. Investments in some ""sustainable"" funds jumped to $20bn in 2019, nearly four times the previous year's record, according to data from Morningstar. In the US, assets managed with sustainable investing strategies now represent more than a quarter of all investment assets under professional management, according to estimates by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Teenagers risk missing out on savings pots,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter These funds were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government. Campaigners worry that hundreds of thousands remain unaware of the money, which would total hundreds of pounds. Initially, the government provided a Â£250 voucher in the child's first year and the same amount again when they reached the age of seven, to be invested in cash or stocks and shares on the child's behalf until he or she turned 18. Children born from September 2002 were eligible. If the child was born into a family with a low household income then the payments totalled Â£500. In August 2010, those sums were reduced to Â£50, or Â£100 for those in low-income homes. These stopped entirely in January 2011 during the coalition government, but in the meantime six million young people were assigned these savings, which could be topped up by their family, friends or the children themselves. These accounts remain, although some people would have switched them into Junior Isas. September marks 16 years since eligibility for the first funds began and, under the rules, anyone turning 16 can apply to take over the management of their fund from their parents, their carers, or the UK tax authority. Although they are unable to withdraw these savings until they turn 18, they will still be able to manage their account such as choosing which provider oversees their investment. An estimated 75,000 youngsters will turn 16 in September alone, giving them the opportunity to do so. However, more than one million of these funds are ""lost"" to the youngsters who are supposed to benefit from them, according to Gavin Oldham, chairman of the Share Foundation, which administers Child Trust Funds for children in care. He said that these funds - including about 440,000 for children from disadvantaged backgrounds - were opened almost entirely by HM Revenue and Customs on the children's behalf, when their parents had not done so within the first year of their birth. They would probably have received a letter when the fund was set up, but may have ignored it or moved away. Typically, the fund is now worth Â£1,600. ""There should be a special effort from the government to re-link these [funds] to the young people to whom they belong,"" he said. HMRC has a dedicated service to help people find out where their Child Trust Fund is held. The tax authority wrote to parents as their child became eligible for a Child Trust Fund and, after that, any communication should have been between them and the provider of the trust fund account.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Call to extend EU settlement scheme pilot to include family members,"The EU Settlement Scheme pilot is open to health and social care workers and university staff. It begins next month and will offer the chance to apply for settled status before the UK leaves the EU in March. But family members will have to wait to a later date to confirm their status. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman and her Welsh counterpart Vaughan Gething have urged UK Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes to reconsider, and have offered to host a pilot in Scotland and Wales in which relatives can take part. The Home Office said family members would be able to apply ""when the scheme is rolled out more widely"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and the UK government has said it wants EU nationals living in the country to be able to stay. In a letter to the UK immigration minister, the Scottish and Welsh health secretaries said failure to include family members in the settlement scheme pilot would mean they would be unable to ""actively promote"" it. They said: ""We reiterate our view that the scheme as currently proposed is much more likely to deter, rather than to encourage, our EU staff from taking this opportunity to clarify their immigration status ahead of the UK leaving the EU on March 29 2019. ""We ask that you reconsider your decision not to include family members in the scheme. ""If you are amenable, and if your concerns are mainly about making the pilot cohort too large to manage, then we would be content to pilot the inclusion of family members in Scotland and Wales.

""In order to ensure that the numbers of those involved in the testing remain controlled, family members of those applying during the private beta are not able to apply - unless they are themselves eligible through their employment with, or support from, the participating organisations. ""Family members of those granted status under the private beta can apply when the scheme is rolled out more widely.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM,"By Justin RowlattChief environment correspondent The prime minister will tell a meeting hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that climate action ""cannot be another victim of coronavirus"". He will urge leaders to ""look ahead to how we will rebuild"" after the pandemic and how to ""build back better"". Mr Johnson is expected to speak to leaders via video link. His speech at Thursday's UN Climate Action Roundtable is part of the preparations for a global climate conference the UK is hosting in partnership with Italy in Glasgow in November next year. The UN conference, known as COP26, is the most important round of climate talks since 2015, when the landmark Paris Agreement was secured, committing all countries to work to limit further rises in temperature. Mr Johnson will also announce that the UK is to co-host an event with the UN on 12 December to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris agreement. The aim is that world leaders will use the December event to announce ambitious new targets for carbon reduction as part of the prelude to the Glasgow conference. As part of the Paris Agreement all countries set their own targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Every five years they are supposed to announce new, more ambitious carbon reductions and set targets for when they will be able to reach what is known as ""net zero emissions"" - when greenhouse gas emissions are avoided completely or offset by planting trees or sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere. Getting nations to agree to deeper carbon cuts is essential if the Glasgow conference is to achieve the UN's aim of putting the world on track to keep global temperature rises below 2C. ""Look ahead to how we will rebuild, and how we can seize the opportunity to build back better,"" the prime minister will say. ""Let us be the leaders who secure the very health of the planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come."" COP26 was due to have been held in Glasgow in November this year, but was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Johnson wants to kick-start a year of action in the run-up to the climate conference. He says he hopes the UK will serve as ""a launch pad for a global green industrial revolution.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rotherham children's services 'transformed',"Rotherham Council has been given an overall ""good"" rating following an Ofsted inspection in November. The service had been judged to be failing following 2014's Jay Report, which found up to 1,400 children were sexually abused between 1997 and 2013. Ofsted said the authority had made ""significant improvement"". More stories from across Yorkshire ""The local authority has taken a systematic and rigorous approach to improvement since the last Ofsted inspection in 2014 which identified widespread and serious failures,"" the inspectors said. ""The quality and impact of services for children are transformed."" Children at risk of sexual exploitation were identified and received an ""effective multi-agency response to protect them"", inspectors said. In the wake of the Jay Report the government took control of the authority in February 2015. Some services - though not those for children - were returned to local control in 2017. Children's Commissioner at Rotherham Council, Patricia Bradwell, said: ""The council and its partners have worked very hard to change outcomes for children, young people and families and I am delighted that this hard work has been recognised in this way."" Ofsted added the culture at the council was one of ""openness and transparency"" and staff were dedicated to improving the lives of children and young people. Ailsa Barr, a social work manager at Rotherham Council, said: ""Keeping children safe is the whole council's business, not just children's services' business. ""That means there is good training for staff, there is good investment in children's services by the council, even in times that are incredibly difficult."" She added: ""Child sexual exploitation was not understood in the way that it is understood now, and across the country improvements have been made and it's taken travesties like in Rochdale, Rotherham and other parts of the country for it to become a national focus."" Gordon Watson, deputy leader of the council, said he was grateful to staff for helping to bring about the improvements. ""Three years ago we let the children of Rotherham down, and we are truly sorry for that,"" he said. ""We pledged to use the Ofsted report to examine and improve culture and practice across the organisation and this new report hopefully shows we have done just that.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ken Skates: Access to EU single market without free movement,"But Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian warned the Welsh Government should be ""advocating membership of the single market"" not just access. Caroline Jones said UKIP would fight for ""as low a tariff as possible"". While the Tories' Nick Ramsey said he wanted to be in the single market. Mr Skates was speaking on BBC Wales' Sunday Supplement programme about the Labour AMs vote on Wednesday against a Plaid Cymru assembly motion to support ""full membership"" of the single market. But he said it was ""nonsense"" they had sided with UKIP and the Conservatives on the issue. Mr Skates said: ""I think Plaid Cymru are somewhat confused in terms of what membership and access actually mean. I think they believe it comes without an obligation to have free movement of people. ""If they think you can pick and choose in terms of membership what you then have to comply with, they need to state very clearly they're in support of no change to immigration."" He said: ""What [First Minister] Carwyn Jones and I and the Welsh Government have been crystal clear on is that we need free and unfettered access to the single market. ""In reality, what that means in a simple sense is you don't have tariffs. ""Even countries like Norway, the EEA countries like Iceland and Liechtenstein and so forth, don't describe themselves as members of the single market because being a member of the single market means you essentially have to be a member of the EU. ""What [Prime Minister] Theresa May has said... is there will be a bespoke rather than an 'off the shelf' deal which means the EEA option for the UK is something she's not seriously considering... It's there to be negotiated. ""In the absence of any other indication from the UK Government... we are saying we are filling that void at the moment with a compelling argument for ensuring that Britain retains unfettered access to the single market while also recognising that in the referendum immigration was a major issue so we cannot maintain free movement of people."" Ms Gwenllian told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme: ""It seems to me they [Labour] have reached a hard Brexit position in line with what the Tories and UKIP are saying. ""It seems to me Plaid Cymru is the only party now united around what we think is the best deal for Wales."" Caroline Jones AM said: ""We want to be with everyone in Europe. I think there will be a tariff [on access] but we will fight for as low a tariff as possible."" Mr Ramsey AM said: ""Personally I would rather we were in the single market, whatever form that takes. ""We need some form of access to that market and I think we're all singing from the same hymn sheet on that.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Children's heart surgery: Edwin Poots to meet Irish minister,"Edwin Poots was speaking during a debate on the future of children's heart surgery in Belfast. A report has said that while safe, the service at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children is no longer sustainable. It said children who require surgery should now travel to Dublin. On Tuesday, the chair of the health committee, Sue Ramsey, called on the minister to listen to the voices of younger people just as he had listened to the voices of older people last week. ""Vulnerable voices were heard last week. You've listened to them, you've took it on the chin, you've had a bloody nose all week,"" she said. ""Let's ensure that the vulnerable voices of our future, of the next generation that they're heard and their parents are heard."" Mr Poots told members he did not want to go down the route proposed by the Health and Social Care Board, which advised the ending of paediatric cardiac surgery in Belfast and the transfer of the service to Dublin. The minister outlined a possible two-centre alternative but said it would depend on the agreement of his southern counterpart. Mr Poots said: ""There aren't any easy solutions here. ""It's hugely challenging and it is not easy to square this particular circle."" ""The one option that parents want to see is an option where surgical care is provided in Belfast. ""I cannot stand before this house and say I can deliver that but I will honestly stand before the house and tell you that I will give it my best shot."" The minister said he believed parents in Donegal would prefer to have their children travel to Belfast for surgery. ""I don't wish to raise false expectations,"" he said. The assembly later passed a motion calling for the retention of the surgery in Belfast. The minister's decision on the future location of paediatric surgery is imminent For the past 12 months parents and members of the Children's Heartbeat Trust have campaigned vigorously for the retention of children's heart surgery in Northern Ireland. Last year, a national report said that such centres across the United Kingdom must perform a minimum of 400 children's surgical procedures each year. Belfast currently falls short of that number. A working group recommended an all-island service. Children who require surgery will be expected to travel to Our Lady's Children's hospital in Crumlin, south Dublin. Birmingham was also been cited as an option. Approval of the recommendation by health ministers in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is expected to be a formality.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods,"They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed. The Welsh Government said consultation has not yet started, but highly protected areas are essential. Despite the concerns, fishermen and local companies say there is plenty of fish available and a ready market. Sion Williams, the secretary of the Lleyn Pot Fisherman's Association, says closing off areas of the sea will not work. Wider impact ""We have territory which we fish, and although we do cross over we mostly stay in those areas,"" he said. ""If that area is closed then there will be displacement of not just the fishermen but also of their gear (boat and pots etc) so the impact on other grounds will be more."" Mr Williams says there are around 36 of the smaller (up to 10m long) boats currently registered on the Lleyn, with less than half of those providing full-time employment. The 38-year-old began fishing in 1987 while he was still at school and said there were six boats fishing from Porth Colmon at that time, but it was now down to three, with only himself working full-time. As there is no harbour, the boats are launched off the beach, allowing Mr Williams about four hours at sea depending on the tide. He would not be drawn on figures, claiming he wanted to stay competitive, but said he has ""hardly drawn a wage"" over the past six weeks because of the weather. The produce is sold to an Anglesey company to sell on to markets in the UK, France and Spain, but Selective Seafood in Tudweiliog on the Lleyn also processes his catch. And Mr Williams said fishermen want to be involved in the future of the industry by becoming involved in collecting data for future conservation work. 'Appreciated sensitivities' The Welsh government looks after the marine environment and said it is aiming to have a small number of highly protected marine conservation zones in Welsh waters. It said there was strong scientific opinion, both internationally and domestically, that highly protected sites are an important part of any marine protected area. It said it ""appreciated the sensitivities"" involved, and ""the need to achieve the correct balance between conservation, economic and social interests"". A spokesman said: ""The Welsh government is committed to identifying sites that maximise ecological, economic and social benefits while, as far as possible, minimising any conflicts with the different uses of the sea."" He added that the marine conservation zone project was currently identifying potential sites for the first of three consultation stages which is due to start in the spring. ""The views of fishermen will be crucial to this process,"" he said. ""We expect to be in a position to designate the zones in 2013.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
King Charles III: Outcry 'surprises' Prince William actor Oliver Chris,"BBC Two's King Charles III, which will be shown on Wednesday, imagines events after the death of the Queen. It has ruffled feathers for raising the question of Prince Harry's paternity and showing Princess Diana as a ghost. Oliver Chris, who plays William, told BBC Breakfast people may find the Diana scenes ""difficult to watch"" but that they are handled ""very sensitively"". King Charles III has been adapted from the award-winning play of the same name by Mike Bartlett. This week, the Mail on Sunday ran a front page story voicing concerns from Diana's friend Rosa Monckton that the Prince Harry paternity suggestion was ""deliberately causing pain to a real living person in a salacious fashion"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Chris said he had found the controversy ""really surprising"". Asked whether showing the ghost of Diana was insensitive, he replied that one of the themes of the programme was to depict the ""friction"" between the lives of the real people in the royal family and their institutional roles. ""We can only, as the subjects, imagine what that might be like, which is exactly what this does,"" he said. ""And I think it would be strange if Diana was not a part of the story because she's such a big part of the princes' and Charles' psychology. ""I understand how people might find that difficult to watch. I personally felt that what we see in King Charles III is this really extraordinary, intelligent addition to the debate about our monarchy, and I feel that the presence of Diana is done very sensitively. ""I think it's quite a tasteful addition to this controversial, provocative, thought-provoking story."" He described the drama as ""quite a pro-monarchist film because it upholds the pillars of our society"". Piggott-Smith death 'a shock' He said: ""I would like to think that certainly if William saw my portrayal he would see that it's done with an awful lot of respect and admiration."" Chris also paid tribute to his co-star Tim Pigott-Smith, who plays King Charles and who died last month. ""He was a great friend and a real mentor. For him to be taken from us before he even got to see the film - it's one of those cruel jokes in life. I still can't accept it. It's so recent and such a shock. ""As a final testament to his abilities I think he gives a most extraordinary detailed, nuanced and beautiful performance of this man that we all know and think we know, and maybe love or don't love.""

Anonymous backs new encrypted social network site,"The site, Minds.com, has the same basic set-up as other social networks. Users post updates to followers, who can comment or share content. But unlike its competitors it claims there's no aim to make money from gathering data and all messages are encrypted, so they can't be read by advertisers or by governments. One of the first posts on the site reads: ""There are no free-rides [on social media] and unless you are famous or hit a rare viral nerve, you are pretty much not going to be reaching many other human beings."" It goes on to suggest that if companies can pay to promote pages, it takes the social element out of social networking. The app rewards people for interacting with posts by voting, commenting or uploading. Users ""earn points"" for voting, sharing and uploading which they can then use to ""boost"" their posts to a bigger audience. It claims that this element ""levels the playing field so that literally anyone has a shot at being heard in the overwhelming noise of the web"". Minds.com isn't the first encrypted social network. Sync, which launched in 2013, claimed users could ""share securely and privately"". Facebook started testing a system that allowed users pay to promote posts in 2012. A year later the site tested a mobile payment feature, which used payment details added by users to automatically fill in forms when they make purchases on mobile applications.

Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June,"The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first Â£500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July. The tax break for will now continue until the end of June. After that the nil rate band will be set at Â£250,000 - double its standard level - until the end of September. Rishi Sunak told MPs the extra move was ""to smooth the transition back to normal - and we will only return to the usual level of Â£125,000 from October 1"". The stamp duty holiday was introduced to help buyers who might have taken a financial hit because of Covid. It was also intended to boost a property market hit by lockdown. During the stamp duty holiday there has also been some relief from the equivalent taxes for property buyers in Scotland and Wales - which is set to end on 31 March. Relief for buyers The extension of the stamp duty holiday will provide relief for people buying and selling homes, according to property group Knight Frank. ""The extension is fair because completion dates for buyers and sellers have been jeopardised through no fault of their own,"" said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank. He said the three-month taper until October will make any cliff-edge in June feel less steep. The extension will come as ""a significant relief to people who were stuck in the middle of the buying and selling process, watching time tick down towards the deadline,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But it is also likely to give another kick-start to the property market, she said. ""There's a good chance it will boost enthusiasm for buying and selling again, particularly as we head into the key spring months."" Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk said the extension gives borrowers a better chance of making the deadline ""and could retain borrowers who were going to pull out of the house purchase process"". Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell agreed that there is some justification for a temporary extension but pointed out the move comes at a cost. ""It's not a cheap measure, estimated to cost the taxpayer around Â£1.6bn."" What is stamp duty? Stamp Duty Land Tax is a tax paid on the purchase of property or land in England and Northern Ireland. Last summer, the government temporarily increased the amount at which the tax is paid to Â£500,000, for property sales. The tax break was due to end on 31 March, but it will now end on 30 June. After this date, the starting rate of stamp duty will be Â£250,000 until the end of September. Stamp duty will then return to the usual threshold, and will be paid on property sold for more than Â£125,000. The extension means anyone completing a purchase on a main residence costing up to Â£500,000 before 30 June will not pay any stamp duty. More expensive properties would only be taxed on their value above that amount.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Supreme Court: Trump to name nominee on 9 July,"He told reporters on board the presidential aircraft Air Force One he had narrowed the choice down to ""about five"" candidates, including two women. The vacancy arose when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement earlier this week. It gives President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the top court. His nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate where the president's Republican Party holds a narrow majority. In other comments to reporters on Friday, Mr Trump: 'I like them all' Speaking on a flight from Washington to New Jersey on Friday, President Trump said he would not ask Supreme Court candidates about their position on the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision which legalised abortion across the US. During his campaign, Mr Trump promised to deliver ""pro-life"" judges to the Supreme Court - a prospect that has alarmed women's rights groups. ""I've got it narrowed to about five [candidates],"" he told reporters, adding: ""I like them all."" Mr Trump said he planned to interview one or two of the candidates over the weekend while staying at his golf club in Bedminster. Justice Kennedy, 81, is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court. The court plays a key role in US society and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, stopped President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Although a conservative, Justice Kennedy has sided with liberals on previous decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. US media have reported several front-runners who could replace him: Putin summit agenda In other remarks to reporters, President Trump said he would raise the issue of alleged Russian election meddling when he met President Putin in Finland on 16 July. ""We'll be talking about elections... we don't want anybody tampering with elections,"" he said. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia tried to sway the 2016 US election in Mr Trump's favour, a claim the Kremlin has consistently denied. Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which led to US and EU sanctions, and the war in Syria, would also be discussed, Mr Trump confirmed. He refused to rule out accepting the annexation when he met Mr Putin, saying: ""We're going to have to see."" When asked whether US sanctions on Russia might be lifted, he said: ""We'll see what Russia does.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Southeastern customers face worsening services,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter If you thought your commute was bad now, it will get worse for the next five years. That's the message hidden away in an official Network Rail report on the South East Route. It serves South East London, Kent and Sussex and is one of the busiest in the country. Around 5,000 passenger trains run every day over almost 2,000 miles of track. Almost 68,000 passengers travel on this route into central London during the peak hour of 08:00 to 09:00 each weekday but its infrastructure is amongst the oldest. And spending on the bridges, tracks and signalling has not kept up and there has been a huge historic lack of investment in infrastructure. The report says ""the route's asset base is incredibly fragile with an on-going potential for low frequency, high impact failures"". ""A number of critical assets are degrading beyond a condition which can be addressed by preventative interventions,"" it states. At the moment, 89.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of the planned time (PPM). That is set to drop to 87.2% in 2020 and will not get better than it is at the moment until beyond 2024. Network Rail doesn't deny services will be hit. A Network Rail spokesperson said: ""Our plan for the South East route for the 2019-24 funding period sets out how we would invest more than Â£3bn to operate, maintain and renew the busiest and most congested part of Britain's rail network - delivering a safe, reliable railway in the South East which moves half a million people and thousands of tonnes of freight every day. ""We've had to make some tough decisions in recent years regarding our day-to-day spending, with more maintenance work required than on less busy parts of the network to keep ageing infrastructure working reliably. ""At the same time, we've delivered huge investment in upgrades such as the Thameslink Programme, which will deliver significant benefits for passengers in the years ahead through better connectivity and more frequent services. ""Our plan for the next five years would see Network Rail and train operators continue to deliver good levels of punctuality to record numbers of passengers on a railway which, for many people, offers a turn-up-and-go service at the busiest times of day. ""We know this will put additional pressure on what is already the busiest and most congested part of the network, which is why our plan includes new Digital Railway technology to squeeze all we can out of the network and keep passengers moving safely and reliably."" The grim realisation for commuters though is there is little chance at the moment of an improvement to their service.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
RHI inquiry: Call for review of special adviser role,"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter David Sterling's witness statements to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) inquiry were published on Wednesday. He is due to give evidence again on Thursday. The RHI scheme was set up in 2012 to encourage uptake of eco-friendly heat systems, but overgenerous subsidies left NI taxpayers with a Â£490m bill. The extent of the overspend exploded into public view in late 2016, leading to a political fallout between the two main parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - which saw almost a decade of devolved government collapse in January 2017. Subsequent elections and talks processes have failed to reach a breakthrough. Mr Sterling has led the civil service at Stormont since June 2017. 'Strong case' He was previously the permanent secretary in the enterprise and finance departments. The inquiry has spent a lot of time looking at the relationship between ministers and their unelected special advisers, and how much power advisers wielded over decision making. Ultimately policy decisions were meant to be taken by ministers, and advisers were there to give advice - but the inquiry has heard claims that DUP advisers took many decisions during devolution. Mr Sterling said that in response to what has emerged at the inquiry, he believes there is a ""strong case"" for a review of the role of advisers before any return to devolution. He said he did not want to pre-empt the inquiry's findings, but that it should be made clear to ministers that it is their role to manage special advisers, and that they are ""fully responsible and accountable for them"". Mr Sterling said he did not believe a new code for advisers was needed, but added that the civil service is currently looking at the current codes relating to the relationships between ministers, civil servants and advisers. He said the civil service would be in a position to make recommendations to any future ministers. The inquiry has also heard evidence that has not reflected well on the civil service. It seemed civil servants were sometimes out of their depth when it came to complex issues like the RHI scheme, and it has been claimed some of them accepted assurances at face value. 'Unfair' Mr Sterling said he accepted ""multiple mistakes"" had been made and that he would ensure nothing similar ever happened again. But he added that it would be ""unfair"" to judge all 23,000 civil servants in Northern Ireland by the failings of one scheme, ""no matter how significant and disappointing"" the failings had been. The last time Mr Sterling gave evidence, he revealed that sometimes minutes had not been taken at meetings in a bid to frustrate Freedom of Information requests. On Thursday, Andrew McCormick, the former permanent secretary at the enterprise department when problems with the scheme emerged, will also return to finish his evidence to the inquiry. The inquiry's oral hearings are due to end on Friday, after 111 days of evidence heard by the panel.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Video 'shows hunt law breached',"By David MillerBBC Scotland environment correspondent Campaigners claim the ban on hunting with dogs is routinely being flouted. Hunt supporters insist they take great care to respect the law. The Jedforest Hunt was secretly filmed by the League Against Cruel Sports in February. The men who have been charged are due to appear at Jedburgh Sheriff Court at a later date. The case comes as Lord Bonomy carries out a review of the law on hunting in Scotland. In 2002, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation that banned hunting with dogs. But packs of hounds can still legally be used. The law allows hunts to use hounds to drive foxes from cover and towards waiting gunmen. The League Against Cruel Sports says its covert surveillance shows that did not happen in this case. The footage appears to show a fox being pursued by a pack of hounds on two occasions. On the second occasion, the animal disappears from view while still being pursued. 'Hunting, not flushing' Describing the video, the League's director in Scotland, Robbie Marsland, said: ""That's hunting, that's not flushing with guns and we didn't see that fox again, I'm afraid."" Mr Marsland is calling for the law to be tightened. He said: ""We think there are some quite small changes that can be made to the legislation which would stop it being possible to take a pack of hounds out into the countryside and chase and kill wild mammals. ""The parliament wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and the Scottish people would know and be secure in the knowledge that fox hunting was really banned in Scotland. ""Scotland would be the first place in the UK to really ban fox hunting."" The Scottish Countryside Alliance argues huntsmen go to great lengths to ensure they remain within the law. Its director, Jamie Stewart, told BBC Scotland: ""We would hope very much that Lord Bonomy will review and recognise that the act is enforceable and indeed enforced. ""There's been 210 cases since 2002. ""It's got a 57% conviction rate, so the general public should feel confident that the police are able to identify areas where there is criminal activity and prosecute those who're responsible. ""The protocols within the mounted packs is such that there has not been a successful prosecution against them simply because there's been no evidence of any illegal action."" Court case A police spokesperson said: ""Police Scotland has charged two men, aged 23 and 65, under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002. ""Both men will appear at Jedburgh Sheriff Court at a later date. ""We work closely with a range of partners to tackle wildlife crime. ""We would urge members of the public to report any suspicious activity to us as quickly as possible to allow us to investigate suspected crimes promptly.""

Coronavirus: Welsh arts organisations 'losing Â£1.4m a week',"Nick Capaldi warned the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff could lose Â£20m over the current financial year. He told a meeting of the Senedd's culture committee the industry was ""on its knees"" and would need ""careful support"" if it was to survive. He said cash flow was the biggest issue and groups who are least dependent on public money were worst affected. ""Organisations like Chapter in Cardiff, Galeri in Caernarfon and the Wales Millennium Centre - less than 20% of their funding comes from public sources,"" he said. The UK government's furlough scheme has been ""a real lifesaver for a large number of organisations"", Mr Capaldi said. But he was concerned if the scheme was to come to an end there was a ""real risk and danger of casualties in the industry"". Around a third of the arts council's ""major portfolio organisations"" were critically dependent on that support, he said. He explained that most organisations, particularly those in the performing arts, were ""not imagining that they will be back in serious business much before Easter of next year"". ""This very important aspect of Welsh economic and cultural life is on its knees and it will be the last out of lockdown. ""It's going to need our careful support and nurturing if it's to survive in the longer term,"" he told the committee, meeting via video link. He said the arts sector was ""holding our own in Wales, and that's largely because of the support and co-operation we've had from the Welsh Government in helping to plug the gaps where the UK government hasn't been able to help"". ""But we're clinging on by our fingertips."" The committee heard the Arts Council of Wales had provided emergency grants for individuals of Â£2,500, and grants for organisations to offer more long-term stability of up-to-Â£35,000. Of a total fund of Â£7.5m, Â£2m has been budgeted for the grants for individual who work in the arts. The remaining Â£5.5m has been allocated for supporting organisations. A total of 71% of applications for the first round of individual emergency grants were successful, but Mr Capaldi expressed surprise the number was not higher. ""There were a lot of individuals who were outside Wales who were applying and there were a number of difficult conversations about eligibility."" He said applications from boy band impersonators had ""stretched our definition of public cultural benefits"". 'They would only be able to sell one seat in six' Raising concerns about social distancing measures, Mr Capaldi said the Wales Millennium Centre would ""only be able to sell one seat in six"" if it was to apply current rules. ""So Lion King to an auditorium of 300 doesn't make sense financially and it's probably a pretty poor audience experience as well.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

The parliamentary Easter recess comes at a turbulent time in politics, with Brexit deadlocked in Parliament and no resolution - yet - from talks between the government and Labour. Last week, the EU extended the Brexit deadline to 31 October, prompting calls from several Conservative MPs for the prime minister to stand down before the summer. Before the cross-party talks began, Mrs May faced calls from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to call a general election to break the Brexit deadlock. Downing Street said the prime minister, who survived a confidence vote of her own MPs in December, began her holiday on Saturday and no further details were given. Asked whether she was considering another election, her spokesman replied: ""No."" In April 2017, as Britain went back to work on the day after Easter Monday, Mrs May stood on the steps of Downing Street to deliver her surprise call for an election. At the time, she told ITV News she had thought ""long and hard"" about the matter while relaxing in Snowdonia. Talking more recently about her fondness for north Wales, she said she and Philip ""love going there because the scenery's great, the hospitality is great, we get a great welcome there and it's a wonderful part of the country"". Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn has been pictured taking part in a range of recreational activities during a visit to a youth activity centre in Calderdale, West Yorkshire. The Labour leader had a go at archery and tried a canoe out for size, although he was there ostensibly to highlight cuts to youth services. Ahead of the visit, he said these services play an ""absolutely vital role in our communities"" but austerity is pushing them ""to the brink"". Mr Corbyn has previously said Britain is in ""limbo"" with ""deep uncertainly"" for businesses and workers over the government's handling of Brexit.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Endangered species: Gunshot detection technology deployed,"By Cristina CriddleTechnology reporter New technology has been developed by international conservation charity the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Google Cloud. Acoustic sensors placed in nature reserves or safaris can record events up to 1km (0.6 miles) away. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse audio for gunshots, alerting anti-poacher patrols. Conservationists currently rely on camera traps to track poachers. The traps are activated by movement, and limited to close range within line of sight. But acoustic sensors are cheaper, record continuously and can detect events further with a 360-degree radius. The pilot Google Cloud and ZSL trialled this technology in Dja Faunal Reserve in Cameroon. They placed 69 audio recording devices into the park for a month, generating the equivalent of 267 days of continuous sound. This was then searched by Google's AI for any gunshots, which were linked back to a location within the park. Anthony Dancer, conservation technology lead at ZSL, said pinpointing poacher hotspots could prevent further hunts. ""Park staff can use [the information] to develop responses to those threats,"" he added. ""Planning where to deploy patrols in the areas and at the time of day where you most expect illegal activity."" The next step is fundraising and then expansion into conservation areas, he said, adding that the devices cost about Â£50 ($66) each. The project is currently focusing on gunshots, but Mr Dancer hopes that in the future they could also identify humans talking, which could indicate poachers or human interference - or the sounds of endangered species, to monitor how many of them there are, and their wellbeing. ""Animal poaching remains a global problem and with such catastrophic declines in some species, it's an issue that cannot be ignored,"" said Omer Mahmood, head of customer engineering at Google. He explained that by using machine learning in the technology, the computer reduced months of work into hours, as there was no need for a human to listen back manually through all of the recordings. ""We're committed to supporting ZSL and other conversation organisations with the best tools to tackle the current crisis,"" he added. Previous use Gunshot detection technology is already used by police forces in the US. In 2010, West Midlands police force trialled it in Birmingham but removed the pilot two years later due to ""technical difficulties."" At the time, the technology from ShotSpotter was said to have an 85% efficacy rate. ""One of the most challenging things with identifying gunshots is that the sound bounces off surfaces,"" Professor Mark Plumbley, from the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, explained. ""In cities this is usually buildings, cars or people. So the technology can be inaccurate. ""I think it is an excellent application of this technology, to use it in conservation, where there are big open spaces and less air pollution. But there may still be vegetation or other things that get in the way.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Carrie Fisher given 'amazing' send-off in Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"The London-born actor said he shares ""many scenes"" with the late actress in Star Wars: The Last Jedi and that the sci-fi franchise ""keeps her alive"". Fisher, who played the part of Princess - later General - Leia, died last December aged 60. Her final film performance will be seen when the latest Star Wars blockbuster is released at the end of the year. Boyega, who played stormtrooper Finn in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, told US broadcaster ABC: ""It sends her off in a very amazing way. ""She is still kept alive in this franchise and that's the beauty of it - she lives forever in a sense."" Boyega was with family in Nigeria when he found out about Fisher's death, which came four days after she was taken ill on a flight from London to Los Angeles. ""It was a strange, strange feeling,"" said the 25-year-old, currently promoting his role in race drama Detroit. ""I felt like everybody in the cast and obviously around the world [and] went silent for a bit."" His comments came as Fisher's actress daughter, Billie Lourd, spoke about the last time she saw her mother. ""The last time I saw her in person, this episode of Scream Queens was on, and it was a big episode for me,"" she told fellow actress Sarah Paulson in Town & Country magazine. ""I had tons of scenes, and I was so hard on myself about it - I hated how I looked, hated my performance. I was really frustrated. ""She told me, 'Come over right now. I want to watch this with you.' And she made me sit down and watch it, and she forced me to see the good parts. ""She was incredible like that. But she was really hard on me, saying, 'Shut up, you're great in this. Have faith in yourself. Be more confident.""' Lourd lost her grandmother Debbie Reynolds the day after her mother's death and admitted she had always ""lived in their shadows"". ""I love being my mother's daughter, and it's something I always will be, but now I get to be just Billie,"" she added. Elsewhere in the Star Wars universe, it has been revealed that the next film in the series - Star Wars: Episode IX - is to be rewritten by British writer Jack Thorne. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the writer of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is working on the ninth instalment, to be directed by Jurassic World's Colin Trevorrow. Meanwhile, director Ron Howard has told the same publication the Han Solo stand-alone film is ""coming along great"". ""It's a fantastic script, a great cast and I am having a fantastic creative experience with it,"" he is quoted as saying. Howard took over the film from Christopher Miller and Phil Lord after they left the project, citing ""creative differences"" with producers.

Coronavirus: Paris restrictions to stay as France reopens,"Edouard Philippe said the country was ""cut in two"" in terms of the rate of infections. Restrictions will remain in the capital and north-eastern regions. It comes as France prepares to relax its lockdown on Monday, with shops and some schools allowed to reopen. The country has suffered one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in Europe. Almost 26,000 people there have died from the disease in hospitals and care homes, but the number of new cases has also fallen in recent days. On Thursday, the health ministry said the virus had claimed 178 lives over the past 24 hours - 100 fewer than a day earlier. Restrictions - introduced on 17 March - would be lifted over the course of several weeks, Prime Minister Philippe said on Thursday. ""It's good news for France and for the French people,"" he said. The government has issued a colour-coded map of the country, splitting the country in half into green and red zones. The map combined infections over the past seven days, stress on intensive care beds in hospitals and testing capacity. Restrictions will be eased more in the green areas than the red for the time being. To begin with, primary schools and most businesses will be allowed to reopen in both zones. Cafes, restaurants and secondary schools will be able to reopen in June in the green zones, infection rates permitting, Mr Philippe said. In Paris and the four adjoining regions - Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte - which comprise the red zone, public parks and gardens will stay shut. Masks must be on worn on public transport, which will be disinfected at least once a day, and stores will have the right to ask shoppers to wear them. Social distancing rules will also stay in place. But for the first time since the lockdown began, people everywhere (except the French Indian Ocean island of Mayotte) can go back to work and leave home without downloading a permit. Video surveillance cameras will monitor how many people are wearing masks and staying at least a metre (3ft) apart. In other developments in Europe: You might also like:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
RBS chief hopes to make Ulster Bank decision by end of summer,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Ross McEwen said ""all options"" were still being considered for what has been the worst performing part of RBS. Ulster Bank posted a profit of Â£17m for the first quarter of 2014 - its first quarterly profit since 2009. Ulster Bank is the largest bank in Northern Ireland and the third biggest in the Republic of Ireland. The bank's future in Northern Ireland looks assured with the business becoming more closely aligned with RBS UK. However, the precise of the shape of the bank in the Republic is more uncertain. Mr McEwen said the aim was still to build the bank's Republic of Ireland business into a challenger to the two main Dublin-based banks. However, he said that as it stands the bank is ""just too small"" be a challenger to Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank (AIB). He said reshaping it could involve ""somebody else"" - that refers to speculation that the bank was seeking to merge its Republic of Ireland business with a lender such as Permanent TSB. There have also been reports that RBS has approached private equity firms to invest in such a merger. On Friday, the Irish Independent reported that the bank could ultimately float its Republic of Ireland business on the stock market. Ulster Bank has also shown diverging performances on the different sides of the Irish border. The bank rarely makes this information available, but a presentation given in 2013 showed that on almost every measurement the Dublin-based part of the bank was in a worse condition. There has been speculation that the bank could ultimately retreat from its Republic of Ireland business, but Mr McEwen reiterated that ""we do want to stay and give the services to customers"". The bank said the return to profitability was a ""key milestone"" reflecting improving trading conditions. The loss of almost Â£1bn in the final quarter of 2013 was the result of the bank having a big one-off cost relating to the creation of an internal ""bad bank"". The improved performance for the first quarter of 2014 was driven by a big drop in the amount the bank had to put aside to cover bad loans, which fell from Â£1bn to Â£47m. Ulster Bank's Chief Executive Jim Brown said the bank was focused on ""sustaining the recovery of our business"" and that must be ""built around providing the best customer service on the island of Ireland"". Turnover for the quarter was Â£206m, slightly down on the same period last year. The bank showed an improvement in its ""net interest margin"" - an expression of how much it earns from the basic business of lending money. It rose to 2.36% compared to 1.85% in the same period in 2013. However, the bank's cost-to-income ratio rose to 69% compared to 63% at the same time in 2013.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Can Clegg's European strategy revive Lib Dem fortunes?,"By Chris MasonPolitical correspondent, BBC News But Mr Clegg need not worry. It's one of several portraits hanging on the wall and depicts Alderman James N. Paxman, the Mayor of Colchester and High Sheriff of Essex at the end of the 19th Century and beginning of the 20th. Around 60 activists have gathered, waiting patiently as Mr Clegg is delayed by problems on the rail line from London. As chairs are put in place and posters and banners prepared, the conversation with reporters revolves around one theme: just how bad will these elections be for the party? ""However dark the night, it always gets light again in the morning,"" says one activist cheerily. ""I'm not sweating because of our situation, but because I have walked here!"" he adds. 'Team IN' Currently, the Lib Dems have one MEP for the East of England, and 11 others across the UK. There are 73 MEPs representing the UK in total. Some have predicted a complete wipe-out for the Liberal Democrats in Brussels and Strasbourg: annihilation. So the party has taken a decision which on the face of it might look odd. Yes, an unpopular party has hooked itself squarely to supporting a possibly unpopular and certainly unfashionable cause. Or, to borrow language from Mr Clegg's introduction to the party's 51-page manifesto for this campaign, ""we are now Britain's only party of IN"". It adds up to this: the European Union might not be the country's most popular cause right now, but it is more popular than the Lib Dems. Polls suggest those who share the Lib Dems' instinctively pro-European outlook significantly outnumber those who vote for the party. So the charm offensive is on, to a targeted chunk of the electorate. A banner at the back of the room has just one word on it, with two letters: ""IN."" Activists standing behind Nick Clegg during his short speech hold placards saying, ""I'm in Team IN"" and ""Fighting for British jobs"". It is Mr Clegg's central message. In fact, at this rally, his only one. 'Missing in action' Leaving the EU would amount to ""monumental economic vandalism"", he says, claiming ""isolationists have got away with peddling myths and falsehoods"". Despite the party's dire opinion poll ratings, Lib Dems take comfort from the fact this is a European Parliament election campaign in which the biggest European question of all, staying in or getting out, is centre stage. Their position is clear cut. So, in an equal and opposite way, is UKIP's. But both the Conservatives and Labour find themselves performing an awkward shimmy on the European question. ""David Cameron and Ed Miliband are missing in action"", is how Mr Clegg put it. In other words, neither can be as categorical as the Lib Dems or UKIP. The big question is whether the electorate has made its own categorical decision on Mr Clegg and his party.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pakistan Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah targeted by US strike in Afghanistan,"Fazlullah's men shot the schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan in 2012. He was also behind the 2014 massacre in the Pakistani city of Peshawar that killed more than 130 schoolchildren. He became head of the Pakistani Taliban in 2013 and has been operating in Afghanistan for years. The US attack was in collaboration with Afghan forces. The US military only confirmed it had carried out a strike aimed at a senior militant figure in the eastern Afghan province of Kunar, which is on the Pakistani border. An Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman told the BBC that Fazlullah was targeted and killed. The Taliban has not yet commented. Earlier this month the Afghan government announced a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban to coincide with the end of Ramadan, or Eid al-Fitr. Days later the Taliban announced a three-day ceasefire with Afghan government forces, also to coincide with Eid. Afghans are celebrating Eid on Friday. President Ashraf Ghani announced in a televised message that both sides had honoured the ceasefire and called on the Taliban to extend their ceasefire beyond Sunday. The US said it too would respect the ceasefire in a statement on 7 June ""to allow the Afghan people to celebrate Eid al-Fitr without fear of violence"". The US has sharply escalated its bombing of Taliban targets in Afghanistan since President Trump announced a new, open-ended military strategy last year. On Friday a spokesman for US Forces in Afghanistan said it was continuing to adhere to the ceasefire ""with the Afghan Taliban"". The Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban are separate groups. Fazlullah is seen as a ruthless extremist who wanted to impose Sharia law across Pakistan. He was once known as Mullah Radio because of his angry sermons, broadcast from the northern Swat Valley in Pakistan. After the brutal school massacre in Peshawar, the influence of the Pakistani Taliban has steadily declined, says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad. The Pakistani army has waged a successful campaign against the militants, pushing remnants of the group across the border into Afghanistan, he says, though they still continue to carry out sporadic attacks. Malala Yousafzai, a campaigner for girls' right to education, recovered from being shot in the head in the 2012 attack when she was just 15, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She is currently studying at the University of Oxford.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New Aberdeen FC stadium could be derailed even if approved,"By Rebecca CurranBBC Scotland reporter The stadium and training facilities would be at Kingsford, near Westhill. Although the final decision is a matter for Aberdeen councillors, Aberdeenshire Council will have to agree to a controlled parking zone (CPZ) and a proposed footbridge - both considered crucial if the project is to go ahead. Aberdeenshire councillors voted in March to object to the stadium plans. The proposed location is about 200m beyond the Aberdeen bypass, close to the boundary between both councils. But Aberdeen city councillors will make the final decision on the planning application. A pre-determination hearing last week was told that if either the CPZ or footbridge were undeliverable, city roads officials would recommend the planning application was refused. The proposed CPZ for Westhill lies wholly within Aberdeenshire. 'Sufficiently mitigated' It would be similar to the scheme in streets around Pittodrie that governs parking on match days. Aberdeenshire Council currently has no controlled parking zones in force. Aberdeenshire's director of infrastructure services, Stephen Archer, said in a written submission: ""The application can only be considered acceptable if the likely impact is sufficiently mitigated through a legally enforceable CPZ that remains in place in perpetuity and is funded by the applicant (AFC). ""The planning and legal process for achieving this would have to be fully demonstrated by the applicants and considered acceptable by Aberdeenshire Council."" The proposed footbridge over the A944 lies partly within Aberdeenshire and partly within Aberdeen City. It has been agreed that Aberdeen FC would pay for both the CPZ and footbridge. Aberdeenshire Council said it had a number of concerns about the footbridge and such a structure would require planning permission in its own right. The local authority says it has not yet had the opportunity to fully consider whether such a proposal would be acceptable in the proposed location. The official submission concludes: ""The provision of these measures are crucial to the success of the transport strategy and even if they progress to a point where both are capable of being delivered, the mechanism requires detailed discussions. 'Ideal location' ""It is therefore considered that the risk of significant adverse impacts to the Aberdeenshire transport network remains too great for the proposal to be accepted."" Aberdeen FC chairman Stewart Milne has described Kingsford as ""an ideal location for supporters"". He has warned that the club faces playing European games in Glasgow or Edinburgh in future. However, campaign group No Kingsford Stadium argues that it is green belt land and the development would have a hugely negative impact locally. They have called for the club to look elsewhere, raising concerns about traffic, parking and noise from the development. Aberdeen City Council is expected to consider its final decision on the planning application at a full council meeting on 11 October.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Birstall house explosion 'caused by broken pipework',"The blast destroyed Janet Jasper's home in Birstall, Leicestershire, and the neighbouring house on 11 December 2017. The house with the gas leak in Allington Drive was empty at the time as the owner had died. It was being sold by his family. His son was there the morning of the explosion and was also injured. In a statement read at Loughborough Coroner's Court, Roger Partridge said he noticed a strong smell when he arrived at the house. He said he initially attributed it to a nearby sewage farm but as the smell persisted he suspected it was gas. 'Covered in rubble' He said he remembered lifting the glass hood which covered the cooker hob in the kitchen before the explosion. ""My next memory is being dazed and my vision was blurry,"" his statement said. ""I was lying down on the kitchen floor in front of the cooker. ""I could not move my body. I was covered in rubble. My hands felt as if they were burning and I could not move them."" He was rescued and spent a month in hospital with a collapsed lung and burns to his hands and face. Forensic scientist, Emma Wilson, said the source of the gas leak was broken pipe work underneath concrete in the hallway. However, she could not determine the ignition that sparked the explosion and said it could have been a timer switch, cooker ignition or light switch. Steve Critchlow, from the Health and Safety Executive, said the pipework was examined but he could not say how long it had been damaged. He said he was ""really confident"" the ignition had come from the kitchen. John Jasper, who was also injured, previously described how his wife, Janet, was in bed when there was ""an enormous flash and bang"". He said a gas engineer had been called out a day earlier after he smelt gas but could not find a leak. Mr Jasper added the tragedy ""could have been avoided"" if the engineer had carried out the same gas checks next door. The inquest continues.

Canada's immigration website crashes during US vote,"Officials have confirmed that the cause was a higher than normal level of traffic. It has been suggested this may have been caused by US citizens exploring their options following Donald Trump's victory. The tycoon confounded polls predicting he would lose to Hillary Clinton. ""The Government of Canada is committed to secure and reliable IT infrastructure toâ ensure high-quality services to all users,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship website became temporarily inaccessible to users as a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic. ""Shared Services Canada worked through the night and continues to work to resolve the issue to ensure that the website is available for users as soon as possible."" The problem was widely commented about on social media. The issue is not the only glitch linked to the US elections. Officials were unable to access Colorado's voter registration database for about half an hour on Tuesday afternoon. ""Clerks can't process mail ballots that need to have the signature verified,"" tweeted Lynn Bartels, spokeswoman for Colorado's secretary of state, at the time, adding that in-person votes also had to temporarily be treated as being ""provisional"" while the fault endured. ""Unfortunately our system goes down now and then,"" she said. North Carolina's State Board of Elections was also forced to switch from using an electronic voting check-in system to a paper-based one at several of its precincts after experiencing ""technical problems"". It later reported a delay in uploading about 93,000 of its voting results before solving the problem. There were also unverified claims that some machines had switched votes for one candidate for another. ""The machines, you put down a Republican and it registers as a Democrat, and they've had a lot of complaints about that today,"" Donald Trump told Fox News. However, officials had blamed earlier reports of such problems on ""user error"". Elsewhere, the Verge has reported that a company that had provided a get-out-the-vote telephone and texting service to the Clinton campaign had suffered a cyber-attack causing ""brief periods of unavailability"". The news site reported that members of the 4chan chat site had said they had intended to carry out a denial-of-service attack - which involves flooding a target with internet traffic - which might have been responsible. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has acknowledged ""an internal issue"" caused its instant messaging tool to stop working for about an hour on Tuesday morning. The service is used by financial traders and money managers to discuss market-moving events. The Financial Times reported that users temporarily switched to WhatsApp, but that the fault ""frayed nerves"" ahead of the election results.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grave of 'George III's granddaughter' restored in Carmarthen,"Experts say Caroline Prytherch and her sister were related to the former king due to his links with Hannah Lightfoot during his time as Prince of Wales. The previously lost family grave of Ms Prytherch at St David's Church cemetery near Carmarthen had been split in two because of damage and overgrown ivy. Her sister Charlotte's nearby tomb was restored in 2000. The association of George III, whose reign of king was between 1760 and 1820, and Ms Lightfoot has been widely reported for more than 250 years. It is believed they married in secrecy in London in 1759 and had three children. But in 1761, without the marriage being dissolved, the now king married Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz who became his queen. One of George III's and Hannah's daughters, Catherine Augusta, married Carmarthen doctor James Dalton and had four children including two daughters Charlotte and Caroline. The king once gifted an 18th Century piped organ, originally planned for the Chapel Royal in Windsor, to St Peter's Church because of his links with Carmarthen. St David's cemetery is the final resting place of his granddaughter, her husband Daniel and three of their children - and now the grave has undergone a ""secret restoration"" following decades of neglect. Cranes will lift the one-tonne lid of Ms Prytherch's box grave back into position in a refurbishment by the Thomas and Elizabeth Mayhook Charity - which owns the cemetery - that has taken several weeks. ""There are so many unanswered questions and unexplained events over the Hannah Lightfoot story,"" said Richard Goodridge, the charity chairman. ""But what is remarkable from a local perspective is that Caroline's youngest daughter Margaret who died aged eight in 1839, and Caroline's elder sister Charlotte, who died aged 27 in 1832, are the only two persons buried in a brick vaulted tomb in the centre of the chancel directly in front of the altar of St Peter's Church in Carmarthen. ""These two young ladies were regarded as extremely important but nobody can say why. One can only imagine, which is why there has been so much intrigue and fascination about this family over the centuries as to their alleged Royal grandfather George III."" Restoration of the ornate Coalbrookdale cast iron railings that surround the tomb of Ms Prytherch, who died aged 70 in 1875, will take place later this year once funding is secured.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Solar subsidy 'to be protected',"By Bob HowardReporter, Money Box The feed-in tariff scheme was launched last April. It promised a typical household earnings of Â£800 a year and savings on their bills of Â£120. Energy Minister Greg Barker said he was worried industrial scale projects could eat into the scheme's budget. Generous returns If too many large enterprises apply for the tariff, it could make it more difficult for ordinary households to sign up. Greg Payne from Leeds is one of thousands of people considering whether to install solar panels. His roof is unsuitable for the panels but he has been advised he might be able to install them on a frame in his garden. It would cost him around Â£10 000 to put in, but if they are south-facing and unobstructed, they would generate 41.3p per kilo watt hour, which would be index linked and guaranteed for 25 years. If Mr Payne can find the cash for the installation, he believes it could be money well spent, as he told Radio 4's Money Box programme: ""It is a decent return, it is better than an investment account. It could certainly be a goer,"" he said. Commercial exploitation The government has pledged just under Â£400m for the feed-in tariff scheme until 2014. More than 19,000 UK households have already registered to take part. There are fears that unless homeowners like Mr Payne install soon, the money could be used up by commercial enterprises claiming the money. Too many companies are jumping on the bandwagon, according to Greg Barker, the Minister for Energy and Climate Change. ""I am concerned. There have been some very ambitious statements from large companies about the size of solar exploitation,"" he said. ""If I see that large scale solar projects on an industrial scale stand to take a disproportionate amount of the money that is there to be spread widely for homeowners and small businesses, I will act."" Higher bills Others are critical that the cost of the feed-in tariffs will be born by those least able to afford it who cannot install solar panels themselves. The government admits around Â£6.7bn will be put on electricity bills between 2010 and 2030 to pay for the scheme. Environmental campaigner and writer George Monbiot believes it is unfair. ""The people who are most likely to benefit from this are going to be householders who have got their own home and can stump up the Â£10,000 or so upfront costs."" The government however said many social housing projects were also installing solar panels and so their residents were also benefitting. Mr Monbiot believes the Â£6.7bn would be better spent on measures such as encouraging people to insulate lofts. The government said money would be made available for this when it launched its ""Green Deal"" next year. BBC Radio 4's Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 1200 GMT, and repeated on Sundays at 2100 BST.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Great Yarmouth school sets up food bank to help families,"North Denes Primary in Great Yarmouth has started collecting food donations to distribute to families. Head teacher Debbie Whiting said she decided to act when some children were ""too hungry to learn"" after universal credit delays left their families struggling. The government said 100% universal credit advances were available. Under universal credit rules one calendar month is taken for assessment and then it can take seven days for money to arrive in an account. Parent Sadie Carter, who has two children at the school, said when she ran out of money she was ""at rock bottom and crying for days"". ""I didn't know what to do. Then the school came to help,"" she said. ""There was no gas or electricity and my kids would have been freezing at the worst possible time of the year."" The school food bank, set up for parents whose children are in need, has distributed 30 food parcels since it opened five weeks ago. Ms Whiting said she was alerted to the problem by a hungry child who asked for help for her mother who had no food. ""The roll-out of universal credit in Great Yarmouth means some families go for five weeks without any money and some are just above the level where they can get help,"" she said. ""Some families are working and still struggle to make ends meet."" A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""The reasons for food poverty are complex but with universal credit we have made 100% advances available from day one. ""We have also announced a partnership with Citizens Advice to help people make their benefit claims."" What is universal credit? Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people. It replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merges them into one payment. It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible. Claimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Melania Trump: Donald Trump and I are fine,"In an interview with ABC News, she said media speculation about her marriage was not ""pleasant"". Asked if she loves President Donald Trump, she said: ""Yes, we are fine."" He denies having had extra-marital affairs. Porn-star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal allege they slept with him. Mrs Trump said she loved her husband and that the media's coverage of their relationship was not always correct. ""It is not a concern and focus of mine. I'm a mother and a first lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do,"" she said. ""I know what is right and what is true and not true,"" she added. The interview was recorded on her trip last week across four African nations. Mrs Trump refused to be drawn on comments by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who maintained publicly that Melania Trump believed her husband's denials of involvement with Stormy Daniels. ""I never talk to Mr Giuliani,"" she said. In the first part of the interview released on Thursday, Mrs Trump said women who allege sexual abuse must produce ""really hard evidence"". Mrs Trump also claimed she was ""the most bullied person on the world."" What are the alleged affairs? Ms McDougal says she had a 10-month relationship with Mr Trump starting in 2006. He was already married to Melania and hosting TV show The Apprentice. Ms McDougal had signed a $150,000 deal with the tabloid The National Enquirer which gave them exclusive story rights.

Bet365: UK's best-paid boss sees pay rise to Â£265m,"The firm's accounts show compensation, for the firm's ""highest paid director"" rising to Â£265m including dividends. That was Â£48m higher than the total she received last year as the popularity of online gambling continues to grow. However the industry is facing mounting criticism for not doing enough to deal with problem gambling and addiction. The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John who is joint chief executive and her father Peter, the firm's chairman. Last year Ms Coates' pay and dividends were reported to total Â£217m. In the year to the end of March her basic pay rose from Â£199m to Â£220m. The firm paid out Â£90m in dividends in the same year, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of half of Bet365's shares. Ms Coates earned a first class degree in econometrics - the application of statistical methods to economic data - from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction. Bet365, now the largest private sector employer in Stoke, has millions of customers worldwide. It offers sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo. The accounts showed that the firm's revenues grew by 25% in the year to the end of March and operating profit was up by 31%. Increasing criticism While the online gambling sector has ballooned in recent years, it has also come in for increasing criticism over its impact on some customers who have become addicted or accrued large debts. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson recently described gambling as a ""public health emergency"". Bet365 said it was continuing to develop strategies to identify gamblers at risk and to ""help customers bet responsibly"". However, Luke Hildyard, spokesman for the High Pay Centre, which campaigns against excessive executive remuneration, said ""betting companies are not exactly a force for good in the world"". ""There is an increasing perception that big business only serves the interests of an elite few - a billionaire taking hundreds of millions more from a company that profits, in part, from other people's addictions does nothing to dispel that perception,"" he said. Ms Coates, 51, lives in Cheshire with her husband, Richard Smith, who also serves as the firm's property director, and their children. The group owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of Â£21m and in 2017 the group paid Â£75m into its charitable fund, set up in Ms Coates' name.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India Kolkata flyover collapse: At least 20 dead,"More are feared trapped under the concrete and steel bridge, and rescue efforts are continuing all night. Images show residents using their bare hands to help find victims. Safety issues such as lack of inspections and the use of substandard materials have plagued construction projects in the country. The accident took place in an area near Girish Park, one of Kolkata's most densely populated neighbourhoods, with narrow lanes, and shops and houses built close together. The 2km-long (1.2 mile) flyover had been under construction since 2009 and missed several deadlines for completion. The causes of the disaster were not immediately clear but the company in charge of the construction, IVRCL, said it would cooperate with investigators. CCTV footage posted on social media appears to show the moment the structure collapses, hitting passers-by, auto rickshaws and nearby buildings. Witnesses say other cars, buses and lorries have also been hit. People are said to have been living in makeshift homes under the flyover. The army and national disaster agency in India have joined the rescue operation, which has been hampered by difficulties in getting ambulances and other vehicles close to the site. Emergency teams have been sent with sniffer dogs, concrete cutters, drilling machines and sensors to detect life, a rescue official told AFP news agency. Ramesh Kejriwal, an eyewitness, told Reuters: ""There was a loud sound which scared us. The concrete had been laid last night at this part of the bridge."" Chaotic scenes: Rahul Tandon, BBC News, in Kolkata These are chaotic scenes, as officials are desperately trying to clear the area, worried that the rest of the flyover may collapse. They are trying to bring in equipment to clear the rubble and rescue those who may be under it. But the proximity of the buildings may limit the access for heavy lifting equipment to the area. It is a race against time and the death toll may rise. A rescue official said there were buses trapped. Locals have been digging through the huge slabs of rubble with pick axes while police hold back relatives desperate for news of the missing. As the operation continues, angry relatives arrive looking for their loved ones. At the same time, more bodies are being taken away. Another eyewitness, Ravindra Kumar Gupta, together with friends pulled out six bodies. He told the news agency: ""Every night, hundreds of labourers would build the flyover and they would cook and sleep near the site by day."" India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in Washington in an official visit, tweeted that he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the collapse. ""My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives in Kolkata. May the injured recover at the earliest,"" he added.

'Unsolvable' exam question leaves Chinese students flummoxed,"Primary school students at a school in the Chinese district of Shunqing were faced with this question on a paper: ""If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard, how old is the ship's captain?"" The question appeared on a recent fifth-grade level paper, intended for children around 11 years old. Pictures of the question, along with students' valiant attempts at answers, surfaced this week on Chinese social media - where it triggered debate and quickly went viral. Education officials later said the question was not a mistake, but meant to highlight ""critical awareness"". ""The captain is at least 18 because he has to be an adult to drive the ship,"" one student answered. ""The captain is 36, because 26+10 is 36 and the captain wanted them to add up to his age,"" another guessed. One student however, simply gave up. ""The captain's age is... I don't know. I can't solve this."" Online, however, people weren't quite as generous. ""This question makes no logical sense at all. Does the teacher even know the answer?"" said one commenter on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. ""If a school had 26 teachers, 10 of which weren't thinking, how old is the principal?"" another asked. Some however, defended the school - which has not been named - saying the question promoted critical thinking. ""The whole point of it is to make the students think. It's done that,"" one person commented. ""This question forces children to explain their thinking and gives them space to be creative. We should have more questions like this,"" another said. 'Think outside the box' The Shunqing Education Department posted a statement on the 26 January saying the test had intended to ""examine... critical awareness and an ability to think independently"". ""Some surveys show that primary school students in our country lack a sense of critical awareness in regard to mathematics,"" it said. The traditional Chinese method of education heavily emphasises on note-taking and repetition, known as rote learning, which critics say hinders creative thinking. But the department said questions like the boat one ""enable students to challenge boundaries and think out of the box"". And of course, there's always that one person that has all the answers. ""The total weight of 26 sheep and 10 goat is 7,700kg, based on the average weight of each animal,"" said one Weibo commenter. ""In China, if you're driving a ship that has more than 5,000kg of cargo you need to have possessed a boat license for five years. The minimum age for getting a boat's license is 23, so he's at least 28.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"New markets for Welsh firms after Brexit, says PM","The Conservative leader said she wanted the ""best possible deal"" for Wales and the whole of the UK. Meanwhile, Mrs May said the issue over whether ex-UKIP AM Mark Reckless sits with the Conservatives in the Senedd was a matter for the assembly group. Her comments came after Labour denounced her visit to the party's Welsh heartlands on Tuesday as a stunt. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales, Mrs May said: ""I want not only to get the best possible deal for trading with the European single market for the future, for businesses, for farmers, for Wales and the whole of the United Kingdom. ""I also want to see us opening up new markets across the rest of the world for people here in Wales to be trading with. ""Every vote here in Wales and across the UK for me and the Conservatives will be a vote that strengthens my hand in those important negotiations,"" she told the programme. Prior to the announcement of the 2017 general election, a row was sparked within the Conservative party when Mark Reckless left UKIP and joined the Welsh Conservative group as an independent. Asked if she had confidence in Andrew RT Davies' leadership, Mrs May replied: ""Andrew Davies is the leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly."" Speaking for the first time about the row, she added: ""Andrew Davies has been doing a good job in the Welsh Assembly. It's their decision as to who sits with them. ""Mark Reckless is an independent member of the Welsh Assembly."" On Tuesday, Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Carwyn Jones said Mrs May's decision to visit Labour heartlands in Wales was a ""stunt"". He said what was important was that people ""see the Tories for what they are, their idea of leadership is to say nothing and do nothing"". ""What we want is to offer hope,"" he said, ""to say to people it doesn't have to be this way"". Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""You have to travel 1000km across Europe to find a poorer place than West Wales and the Valleys - that is the legacy of the Tories in government. ""The Conservatives have never, and will never, operate in the best interest of Wales, and with Labour too weak and divided to challenge them, it is left to Plaid Cymru to fight for the best possible Brexit deal for our country.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
South Africa parliament chaos as Malema MPs heckle Zuma,"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, repeatedly interrupted Mr Zuma, demanding answers over a spending scandal. The speaker of parliament then ordered their removal, prompting scuffles. The largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, walked out in protest at their expulsion. ""You can't send police into parliament,"" said Democratic Alliance parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane. The EFF used President Zuma's annual State of the Nation speech to question him about a state-funded, multi-million dollar upgrade to his private residence. They were evicted by large numbers of security guards. Among those thrown out was Mr Malema. At the scene: Andrew Harding, BBC News It began rather politely - an EFF MP standing up to interrupt President Zuma about one minute after he had launched into the substance of his State of the Nation address. The speaker of parliament, Baleka Mbete, was expecting it, and urged the MP, and others who followed suit, to leave their questions for another occasion. But when Julius Malema loudly demanded the president ""pay back the money"" from the upgrade to his home, the speaker ordered him to leave. Malema refused, and suddenly several dozen white-shirted security officials were pouring into the room. They crowded around the EFF and began to pull the MPs out of the chamber. I saw one MP try to swing a punch, and another threw his red hard hat at the officials. There were more scuffles and loud shouts. Shirts were torn. Within a few minutes all the EFF MPs had been removed from parliament and the ANC majority began cheering in their seats. Mr Malema defended his MPs' actions, calling it a legitimate attempt to defend democracy, adding that seven of his party had been injured and would be pressing charges. It is not clear whether the guards were police or parliamentary officials: an important distinction, according to one MP, who said the use of police would be a way of intimidating the opposition. Mr Malema and Mr Zuma were once close allies but the pair fell out. The EFF has shaken up South African politics with a series of populist proposals to redistribute wealth. EFF MPs accuse Mr Zuma of benefitting unduly from taxpayer-funded upgrades to his private residence in the village of Nkandla and they wanted Mr Zuma to answer questions about this before making his state of the nation speech. Last year an independent inquiry found the president had ""unduly benefited"" from the expensive upgrades, which included a pool and a cattle enclosure and cost about $23m (Â£13.8m). The president has denied any wrongdoing. Despite criticism of the Nkandla upgrade and the country's stagnant economy, Mr Zuma's African National Congress was overwhelmingly re-elected last year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stolen dogs: Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry raids 'uncover 80',"The dogs and puppies are said to be worth tens of thousands of pounds, Dyfed-Powys and South Wales (SWP) police forces said. Between 70 and 80 were found in Carmarthenshire and another six in Briton Ferry, at the weekend. The six have since been returned to their owners and an investigation into the thefts is under way. ""These dogs are not merely items of financial value, these are living creatures who feel pain and suffering and loss at being stolen and they are much loved family members in many instances,"" said Supt Cath Larkman, of SWP. One panicked animal in Briton Ferry fell into water on its release and was saved from drowning by an officer, she explaining, adding she was ""pleased these dogs"" were back with their owners. Puppies not microchipped On Sunday, Dyfed-Powys Police found dogs and puppies in outbuildings in Carmarthenshire. Det Insp Barry Kelly said officers visited a property after a pet owner reported on Friday the theft of five bitches and 17 puppies. ""On attendance, officers found a number of dogs, some of which have been identified through microchips,"" he said. ""We estimate there to have been 70 to 80 dogs at the property, with the total value reaching tens of thousands of pounds."" The force said it was scanning microchips to find the owners and officers were still at the property earlier. Det Insp Kelly said: ""The problem we have is that the puppies won't have been chipped, so unless they are feeding from the mother dog while we are there, it will be very difficult to trace their owners."" One person was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods at the Carmarthenshire property and is in custody. ""We have had seven crimes reported to us in respect of dog thefts in the past six months,"" Det Insp Kelly said. ""The officers in the case will review these investigations and re-engage with the victims. ""Although we have made an arrest, our enquiries are still at an early stage."" Det Insp Kelly said the value of dogs stolen on one occasion was estimated to be about Â£40,000. ""Which goes to show these are incredibly high value thefts,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government automatically enrols firms in case of no-deal Brexit,"The move will enable UK firms to continue to trade with EU member states after the UK leaves the EU. Business trade groups had urged the government to act after many firms failed to register for the system. The CBI said it was ""a sensible move"" but ""one of hundreds of things that needed to be done"" in a no-deal event. HMRC said all VAT-registered firms in the UK - which had not already signed up to the customs system - would receive an ID number within the next two weeks. The so called Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number will allow firms to continue to trade with customers and suppliers in the EU once the UK has left the EU on 31 October. Firms without an EORI number will not be allowed to trade with EU member states after Brexit. So far, 72,000 companies had registered for an EORI number. The government said its auto-enrolment scheme would mean 88,000 more firms would be registered. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the move would help ""ease the flow of goods at border points and support businesses to trade and grow"". But business lobby groups urged the government to do more to avoid a no-deal. Nicole Sykes, CBI head of EU negotiations, said auto-enrolment would reduce the risk of lorries turning up at ports without one of the necessary pieces of paperwork. ""But the web of short and long-term consequences of no deal go well beyond this, which are both complex and damaging,"" she added. ""That's why the government must put just as much time and effort into securing a deal."" Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said auto-enrolment was ""long overdue"" but still only ""a first step"". ""For many firms, it will trigger more questions. Businesses still need clarity on many other cross-border trade issues, such as customs procedures at borders following a no-deal exit and when the government will launch an official database to provide ease of access to information on tariffs and quotas."" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it will allocate Â£9m to councils to help make sure they are staffed to deal with any issues at ports. Kent Council will get over Â£2.6m due to the pressures it faces around the Port of Dover. Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Manchester pub closures 'won't stop infection rate rising',"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a three-tier system on Monday. Though yet to be confirmed, Manchester is expected to be put in tier three, with restrictions such as pub closures and curbs on travel. Ministers have defended their approach but the five MPs said ""blanket closures"" would not limit the spread. The group sent a letter to the prime minister before his statement on the new system, where every English region will be categorised according to the severity of its coronavirus cases. It has been signed by Lucy Powell, Afzal Khan, Graham Stringer, Jeff Smith and Mike Kane, who all represent Labour. They said Manchester's recent surge in infections had largely been among its student population, and these outbreaks were being managed in confined ""households"" such as halls of residence. Hospitality 'not to blame' Most of the city's other cases had been caught in household settings, they said. The letter said transmission in hospitality settings accounted for ""a very small proportion"" of infections. ""We are concerned that closing all regulated premises will not only lead to gatherings being pushed underground, but won't have a sizable effect on virus transmission rates,"" the MPs said. The group said they had been reassured in Parliament ""that confined outbreaks would not be a reason for tighter restrictions for the wider population."" Putting Manchester in tier three would have a ""devastating impact on jobs, livelihoods and businesses,"" they added. Schools and universities are expected to remain open under the plans. The letter states that city officials had proposed ""a local, intense track and trace"" system and ""well-resourced door-to-door activity"" to communicate the guidance. ""This would need to sit with the economic support available for people to self-isolate,"" the MPs added. 'Treated differently' This weekend, political leaders in northern England said Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement - that the government would pay two-thirds of workers' wages at firms forced to shut - was ""insufficient"". The national furlough scheme launched in March paid 80% of wages. David Greenhalgh, the Conservative leader of Bolton Council, said: ""The North feels like they are being treated differently. ""We know our rates are high - we are not underestimating that - but we cannot throw our local economy to the wall. I urge government to respect that."" On Saturday, the mayors of Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, Sheffield City Region and North of Tyne said the Chancellor's scheme would lead to ""severe hardship in the run-up to Christmas"". The number of reported coronavirus cases in Manchester dropped slightly to 2,641 in the week to 8 October, compared with 2,933 in the previous week.

Mosul Iraq battle: IS accused of shooting civilians,"The UN says 12 civilians were shot dead on 11 November when they tried to stop militants launching rockets from the roofs of the homes in the Bakir area. Militants allegedly killed 27 others suspected of passing information to Iraqi security forces. The government launched an offensive to recapture Mosul six weeks ago. Special forces and army units entered the city's eastern outskirts at the start of this month. However, their progress has since been slowed by sniper fire, suicide car bomb attacks and the presence of more than a million civilians still living there. A spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, Ravina Shamdasani, said reports continued to arrive of serious breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law in and around Mosul. ""[IS] has been installing rocket launchers and placing snipers on the rooftops of civilian houses,"" she said. ""Those who refuse to allow their houses to be used in this way are threatened or killed. These families are effectively used as human shields, placed squarely in harm's way, caught between IS and Iraqi Security Force fire responding to rocket and sniper attacks."" Ms Shamdasani said IS was also continuing to abduct and forcibly move civilians, and to kill those it suspected of leaking information to the government. Reports suggest that on Friday, militants publicly shot to death 27 civilians in Muhandiseen Park, in the north of Mosul, she added. There have also been reports of IS shooting at fleeing civilians, including one from 22 November of an IS sniper killing a seven-year-old child who was running towards troops in the eastern Adan district. Human Rights Watch meanwhile said on Tuesday that an Iraqi government or US-led coalition air strike targeting IS militants south of Mosul last month had hit a medical facility and killed eight civilians, including five children. Two IS militants and the IS ""transport minister"" were also killed in the attack on 18 October in Hamam al-Alil, a witness told HRW. A healthcare worker said militants had forcibly taken over an office at the clinic and that several had been there at the time of the attack, along with about 50 patients. ""Forces attacking [IS] should take all necessary measures to minimise harm to civilians, including those that [IS] forces may have placed at risk,"" said Lama Fakih, HRW's deputy Middle East director. HRW called for an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the incident to establish who was responsible and whether it was lawful.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Male employees want flexible work too,"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness Reporter, BBC News In the past, pressure for the opportunity to work part-time or flexibly has usually come from women trying to juggle childcare and work. But four in five of the men surveyed by the consultancy, Timewise, said they would prefer more control over their working hours or already work flexibly. The survey found that 90% of employees dislike the strict nine-to-five day. Timewise, which advises businesses on implementing flexible working, surveyed 3,000 UK adults, including the employed, part-time, and jobseekers. It found that full-time workers of both genders want flexibility to reduce commute times, increase leisure or study time, and to assist with childcare. Instead of working nine-to-five, many employees would prefer to have the flexibility of working from home on some days, working part-time at the same hourly rate, or working a different set of hours spread across several days. Over-employed The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) supports these findings. The ONS said recently that one in 10 Britons now believe they are ""overemployed"", meaning that they are working more hours than they want. This group of people would be willing to take a pay cut to work fewer hours, and they now outnumber the ""underemployed""- people who desire to work more hours but struggle to get them. Flexible working: Mark Webb's story Since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) 10 years ago, Mark Webb, head of social media at Dixons Carphone has been working a four-day week. ""I had a busy job as company spokesperson and head of media relations, but as my MS progressed, I was starting to fall apart,"" he told the BBC. Senior management approached him and suggested a working arrangement that would allow him to work from home for much of the time, avoiding a long commute. ""I would be medically retired if they hadn't done this for me. They have lengthened my career and indeed my self esteem."" Mr Webb said that he was ""very moved"" by Dixons Carphone's efforts to keep him in employment. The survey from Timewise suggests young people are most concerned about the issue - over 92% of working 18-34 year olds in the survey wanted flexible hours. That contrasts with 88% of 35-54 year olds and 72% of those aged 55 and above interested in a less rigid work day. ""Flexible working is of very high importance to individuals and it's become business as usual for companies, but if you look at the jobs market, people are trapped by the inflexibility,"" Timewise joint chief executive Karen Mattison told the BBC. Timewise said there were not enough jobs advertised as being open to flexible working. ""Getting flexibility right will be an imperative for employers who want to attract and keep the best possible people at a time of skills shortages,"" said Ms Mattison.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Defence review under way says Michael Fallon,"Addressing MPs in Parliament, Mr Fallon said the process was under way. The 2010 review was criticised by many for failing to anticipate uprisings and subsequent conflicts in the Middle East and the growing challenge from Russia. Mr Fallon told MPs many of the 2010 review's findings ""still held good"" but future threats would be addressed. The review comes at a time when the government is under pressure from many of its backbenchers, and the US, to continue to meet the Nato target of spending 2% of its national output on defence. Speaking at Defence Questions in the House of Commons, Mr Fallon said the review would be led by the Cabinet Office and he expected it to be completed by the end of 2015. 'Alarmed' While the process would ""aligned"" with the ongoing review of government spending between 2016 and 2020, he rejected claims that it would be heavily influenced by the Conservatives' stated objective of eliminating the annual Â£90bn budget deficit by 2017-8. The Ministry of Defence is already having to cut Â£500m from its budget this year, having already experienced substantial cuts in funding since 2010 which will ultimately see regular army numbers fall from more than 100,000 to 82,000. But Mr Fallon insisted this year's cuts would not affect current operations, manpower numbers nor the Nato spending commitment. ""Let me be very clear,"" he said. ""This is a strategic defence review, not a Treasury-led review, a review across the whole of government to assess the threats to the country and the future threats that may emerge to our country, the capabilities needed to address those threats and, of course, the resources we need to finance those capabilities."" He added: ""The strategic defence review we have embarked upon will be properly aligned with the spending review because defence to be deliverable has to be affordable."" Former defence minister Sir Gerald Ainsworth said the review needed to be predicated on the growing threats facing the UK not the resources that were available for defence. ""We need to establish the security, the strategic prospects for the UK in a very dangerous world. I, amongst others, are extremely alarmed at another Treasury-driven review when we face a very much more dangerous world than we did in 2010."" Labour said the review process was shrouded in secrecy and urged a ""wide-ranging public debate and discussion"" on existing capability gaps while the SNP said any review had to consider the future of the Trident nuclear weapons system to be credible.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Â£5.6m Newbridge Memo makeover gets under way,"Scaffolding is set to go up at the Grade II listed Newbridge Memorial Hall, known as the Memo, in Caerphilly county. It follows an eight-year fundraising campaign by the hall's trustees and will eventually see the building restored to its former glory. Caerphilly council said it was ""delighted"" work was underway. The plight of the Newbridge Memo won national recognition when it was runner-up in the BBC's Restoration series. Howard Stone, the hall's chairman, said it marked a ""big day"" in the eight-year campaign to bring it up to modern standards. He told BBC Wales: ""We are thrilled to bits to see things moving along. ""It's what we have been waiting for and when people see the scaffolding go up, they will believe work is finally going ahead. ""We are aiming for completion in the last quarter of 2013, with an official opening to coincide with the centenary of the start of World War I in 2014."" The first phase of the work will see new windows on the upper floor of the institute replaced and double-glazed. Work will then begin to repair the roof and stop leaks which have caused damage in various rooms, including the ballroom, over the last year. The main phase of work will begin in May with the demolition of part of the original building and then a new-build to house various new services and office space. The ground floor will be opened up and restored to provide a new library and IT suite for the area. Mr Stone said that, despite local authority cuts, the future of the new library was assured. Live music A later phase will see the restoration of the Memo's auditorium. Ron Davies, Caerphilly council's cabinet member for regeneration and planning, said: ""We are delighted to be working closely with the trustees to bring about the long-awaited regeneration of the Memo and Institute. ""The financial protocol agreed recently by cabinet will help progress the restoration works and provide much needed support for the small group of dedicated volunteers who are driving this scheme forward. ""I now look forward to seeing this historic venue restored to its former glory."" It is the town's main community building, providing facilities for 20 local groups and societies as well as hosting live music and community events. It was built by miners in 1925 to commemorate members of the local community who lost their lives in WWI. Its supporters say it is one of the UK's finest surviving early 20th century art deco cinema theatres, and claim it houses the largest ballroom in the south Wales valleys. Entertainers such as Joe Loss, Clara Novello, Tom Jones, the Stranglers and Manic Street Preachers are all reported to have played there.

Coronavirus funeral restrictions: 'Other families shouldn't have to go through this',"Iolo Cheung BBC News Only 12 people were allowed to attend Bernard Lawrence's funeral last week. His granddaughter Ffion Evans said it was frustrating as many other Covid measures have been eased. The Welsh Government has said it appreciated how ""terribly difficult"" it was for families, but social distancing measures must be respected. Mr Lawrence, from Pembrokeshire, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. The coronavirus pandemic meant treatment was postponed, and his health had deteriorated by the time he was offered it again. The funeral of Mr Lawrence, 76, was held at Narberth crematorium, and his granddaughter says many more than a dozen mourners would have been present under normal circumstances. ""It's quite upsetting because losing someone you love is difficult anyway, but it makes the situation worse, especially since so many restrictions have changed with things like tourism and pubs,"" said Ms Evans. ""I think funerals are very important for families to be able to cope with the death of a loved one, especially during this time with coronavirus. ""People have been coming here from all over Britain [on holiday] but someone who was born and raised in Pembrokeshire can't even have a proper funeral."" Ms Evans contacted the local authority to see whether they could have any flexibility on the numbers, but was told that it was not possible. She said she had been generally supportive of the way the Welsh Government have handled the pandemic until this point. ""But now I feel if places such as pubs, cafes and shops are reopening with a lot of people and not much social distancing, it's time to lift the restrictions on funerals too. ""I don't want other families to have to go through this."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said that the number of people able to attend a funeral service ""is set by each local authority and depends on the size of the venue"". ""We appreciate how terribly difficult this is for grieving families, but we need to maintain physical distancing to reduce the spread of coronavirus."" The government added: ""Whilst the increased risk to patients associated with some ongoing treatments has impacted some NHS services, we have worked closely with health boards to ensure as much cancer care can continue as possible."" In a statement Pembrokeshire County Council expressed their sympathy with the family, ""and indeed with all families who have attended funerals of loved ones at Parc Gwyn Crematorium, Narberth, since the restriction on mourners has been in place"". ""Unfortunately due to the size of the chapel, and in order to observe the Welsh Government's two-metre social distancing rule, we are forced to limit the number of mourners to 12. ""However, following consultation with funeral directors, we are hoping to allow - in the near future - an additional eight mourners to attend a cremation service outside the chapel while at the same time respecting social distancing.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

There's no doubt in my mind."" He told the New York Times the two climbers had been using a technique that allowed them to increase their pace. ""I've been worrying about this speed game for a while,"" said Mr Yager. ""The faster you go the more dangerous it is."" The US National Park Service said the two friends fell from Freeblast, a vertical route up El Capitan. Mr Wells and Mr Klein had been friends since meeting at university in San Diego, according to widow Jennifer Klein. ""I know that he was well loved and made a huge impact in people's lives,"" she told CBS News of her husband. ""They loved each other like brothers."" Mr Klein, who taught at the Palmdale High School in California, had recently won the teacher of the year award from his school district for the second time. According to Climbing magazine, in 2014 Klein climbed at an indoor gym for more than nine hours in an effort to raise money for a student who had been paralysed in a drive-by shooting. The father of two boys had climbed for a total of 29,065ft - higher than Mt Everest - and broke a Guinness Record in the process. Mr Wells, an asset fund manager from Colorado, is survived by his wife and daughter. Wayne Willoughby - a friend of both men - told Climbing magazine that the accident occurred on what would have been Mr Klein's 107th trip to El Capitan. He added that the two friends had climbed together in Yosemite dozens of times over the years, and had been known to scale the 3,000ft megalith twice in one day. ""Tim told me that Jason was the strongest and best partner he ever climbed with,"" Mr Willoughby said. How did they fall? The two mountaineers had been roped together when they fell, local climbing experts say. They had been moving through a relatively moderate part of the route using a technique called ""simul-climbing"" (simultaneous climbing) when they fell, said Brady Robinson of the Access Fund, an outdoor rock climbing organisation. He explained the technique is ""inherently riskier"" than regular climbing, because it allows the group to move at a faster pace. A third person who has not been identified by officials was also present during the climb but did not fall, he added. ""He didn't see what happened - he came to the top of the rope and his partners were gone. He didn't witness it,"" Mr Robinson told the New York Times. According to Climbing magazine, this is the 25th death of a climber recorded on El Capitan. The popular climbing destination sees more than 100, mostly non-fatal, accidents each year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tinder to introduce in-app background checks,"By Cody GodwinBBC News, San Francisco Later this year, Tinder will allow users to view public records information of perspective dates using their name or mobile number. The move comes as user safety for digital dating has come under scrutiny. Match Group, Tinder's parent company, plans to include the feature across all of its platforms at a later date. ""We recognise corporations can play a key role in helping remove those barriers with technology and true collaboration rooted in action,"" Tracey Breeden, Match Group's Head of Safety and Social Advocacy, said. Besides Tinder, the group also owns PlentyOfFish, OkCupid and Hinge. Match has partnered with Garbo, a background checking platform, to provide the paid service. The dating sites company has also invested a stake in Garbo. The background checks company was founded by women and collects ""public records and reports of violence or abuse, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment, and other violent crimes"" to create its reports. The checks will not include any drug charges or traffic violations. In a February blog post, Garbo said: ""The research continues to show that there is no link between drug possession and gender-based violence."" User safety has become an important issue for digital dating companies amid heightened awareness about their risks. A 2019 investigation by ProPublica found registered sex offenders on many of Match Group's free platforms. Following ProPublica's investigation, 11 members of Congress sent a letter to Match Group President Shar Dubey. ""Dating platforms, like those owned by Match Group, must be doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of their users. This means vigilant enforcement of terms of service that empower consumers in any online marketplace,"" the February 2020 letter said. The members urged Match to ""take swift action to reduce the risk of sexual and dating violence against their users."" Currently, if a user reports information about someone's violent past to Tinder, or their sister apps, the offending account is removed. Apps including Tinder and rival Bumble have also added tools like photo verification and in-app video calling to prove people are who they claim to be. In January 2020, Tinder added a panic button feature that would store information about a date, including location data, and alert emergency services if the button was pressed. Sarah Sawrey-Cookson, communications director at Get Safe Online, praised Match's plan to add the background checks feature. She told the BBC: ""we've always emphasised the need for both first-time and experienced online daters to exercise caution and 'check the person, not the profile'. That's why we applaud any initiative which enables people to carry out better due diligence before they get into a relationship that could end up being very damaging.""

Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday. They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to protect actors and crews during the pandemic. It is hoped that soaps including EastEnders and Coronation Street will start filming again in June. William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in Corrie, told BBC Radio Derby on Monday that cast members had been told filming should re-start in mid-June. ""They've said it's all going to be very, very different,"" he said. ""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people. ""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back."" However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons. ""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said. DIY make-up and fewer stunts Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are: The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"". Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support. Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. 'A significant step' Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows. ""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall. ""This guidance is an attempt to get that right."" ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ""ITV has been at the heart of informing, entertaining and connecting the UK through the Covid-19 crisis. ""Our production teams are now working hard to bring many more much loved shows back for viewers."" The new guidelines were welcomed by the government, with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling them ""a significant step forward in getting our favourite shows back into production"".

Merthyr baby's death 'could have been avoided',"Tiffany Gillard's son Jenson James Francis died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on 21 June 2018. The inquest at Pontypridd Coroner's Court comes after Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were placed in special measures. On-call consultant Dr Sreevidya Ambika said in hindsight she would have asked for Jenson to be delivered sooner. The inquest heard Dr Alia Bashir was the only doctor responsible for all patients in the hospital's maternity unit during the night. She described a phone call with Dr Ambika, where they discussed the recording of Jenson's heart rate. Despite initial concerns, Dr Bashir said she was given reassurances by Dr Ambika, and did not ask her to attend the hospital. Dr Bashir said she gave medication to Ms Gillard when her temperature spiked as she was concerned about an infection. The inquest heard Dr Bashir then went to carry out a procedure on another patient. She said during this time she received no calls from the labour ward about concerns for Jenson's heart rate. At 03:50 on 21 June, Dr Bashir assessed Ms Gillard and asked the theatre to prepare for delivery. Dr Ambika said when she was informed by Dr Bashir of Jenson's condition and a spike in Miss Gillard's temperature she instructed her ""don't waste time, just deliver straight away"". Dr Bashir was asked why a category two Caesarean section was carried out to deliver Jenson and not a category one. She replied: ""It is my understanding a category one is when there is an immediate threat to baby or mum."" The inquest had previously heard from consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Jonathan Rogers who said that based on the facts of this case a category one Caesarean section should have been carried out. A category one delivery should take place within 30 minutes and a category two inside 75 minutes. When the coroner asked Dr Bashir whether it occurred to her to carry out a category one delivery, she replied: ""It did not come to mind."" Dr Ambika said it was not common practice for the on-call consultant to specify which category should be implemented and it would have been for the registrar to decide. She told the inquest, that having now reviewed the cardiotocography recording of Jenson's foetal heart rate, she would have delivered him sooner. The Coroner asked her whether he would have survived if he had been delivered sooner. Dr Ambika replied: ""The baby would have survived but I cannot say what effect the infection might have had.""

MoT changes come into force in Northern Ireland,"Under the new rules, more than 20 extra checks will be carried out on vehicles. The checks relate mostly to electronic warning systems, including headlamp and airbags indicators, tyre pressure and power steering monitoring systems. The changes will only apply to cars, buses, light goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and trailers which already have the safety systems fitted. Costs Bernard McClure, director of vehicle policy at the Driver Vehicle Agency, said then new test was ""catching up with existing technology in vehicle safety"". He told BBC Radio Ulster: ""If a warning light is on in a vehicle, then it's telling the driver there's something wrong. So if an airbag warning light is on, you run the risk that the airbag could deploy whenever the vehicle is driving. ""And also, the bigger risk is that, if you're in an accident, your airbag may not deploy whenever you most need it."" However, Gabriel Glendinning from GMC Motorworks in Ballykinler, County Down, said garages would require more sophisticated technology to carry out the new checks and the costs would have to be passed on to customers. ""It seems that every time, it's always going to be the motorist that gets hammered,"" he said. But Mr McClure said diagnostic equipment was needed to maintain all modern vehicles and argued that garages should already have the new technology in place. ""We are not trying to catch anybody,"" he told the Talkback programme. ""We want to make sure that the motorist on the road is safe and driving a vehicle that is safe,"" Mr McClure said. Advisory Since 1996, all cars and motorcycles in Northern Ireland that are four years old or over must undergo the annual safety test. The new checks were carried out on an advisory basis in Northern Ireland from 1 February to 30 April 2012. This meant that motorists were advised if their vehicle did not meet the new standards, but they did not fail on that basis. The Department of the Environment (DOE) said the new checks would not apply to every vehicle as, depending on age and type, they would not necessarily have the systems fitted.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Salisbury city best performing in GB shop vacancy table,"Its vacancy rate of 7.7% is the lowest in the country, says the Local Data Company report, with Cambridge (8.5%) and Chesterfield (8.7%) close behind. Lucinda Boddy, who closed her shop in May claiming the city was ""dying"" and pointing the finger at the council, said she found the report ""amazing"". Some 500 town centres and 145,000 shops were visited to gather the statistics. 'Lovely customers' Mrs Boddy, who ran Lulu's Boutique in Fisherton Street, blamed location, parking charges and business rates for her failure in Salisbury. She continues to operate the business from a branch in Lymington, Hampshire, but said she was ""very sad"" to have shut up shop in Wiltshire. ""I can only ever judge what people were saying to us, and customers were saying that 'Salisbury isn't the same'"", she said. ""We had lovely customers in Salisbury and I have always worked there, so yes I do miss it. ""But we are now flying and it does feel for us like we have dropped something that was costing us money, so for me it was the best move. ""It's a very difficult market out there for high street retailers and independent shops and I think it will only be the strong ones that can last it out."" 'Pleasantly surprised' Fleur de-Rhe Philipe, from Wiltshire Council, said the study supported the authority's belief that Salisbury was ""a vibrant city with lots of opportunities for local businesses"". She added: ""Nevertheless, we recognise the need to continue to work hard to support the city's businesses and retailers. ""We are already investing in projects directly targeted at improving the economy and business environment including a major retail-led redevelopment of the Central Car Park and Maltings area."" Salisbury's chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" with the report. ""I'd say it was down to good quality shops with a mixture of national and independent traders all working hard to give customers what they want,"" said Tony Quinn. ""What's nice about Salisbury is that we all work together - the FSB, City Centre Management and the Chamber of Commerce - and then with the city and county councils.""

Monaco's Prince Albert weds South African Charlene Wittstock,"The wedding took place at the royal palace by the Mediterranean, where a more elaborate religious ceremony is to be held on Saturday. Up to 3,500 guests are to attend lavish celebrations in Monaco afterwards. Ms Wittstock, 33, who swam in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, is now Her Serene Highness, Princess Charlene. Earlier in the week the palace denied reports in the French press that Ms Wittstock was having second thoughts about the wedding. Prince Albert II, 53, has been the ruler of Monaco since the death of his father, Prince Rainier III, in 2005. The guest list includes heads of state and royalty, from French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the heir to the Spanish throne, as well as fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld and supermodel Naomi Campbell. Charlene Wittstock's wedding dress was designed by Giorgio Armani. Rumours denied Thousands of Monegasques crowded the plaza outside the palace for the civil wedding. Inside, Philippe Narmino, the president of Monaco's Council of State, declared the couple ""united by bonds of marriage"". The event was clouded by press reports suggesting that Ms Wittstock had come close to returning to South Africa, after learning secrets about Prince Albert's private life. The royal family dismissed the claims, as well as suggestions she had only turned back after royal aides persuaded her to stay. ""These rumours have no other goal than to severely damage the reputation of the monarch and thereby that of Miss Wittstock and severely undermine this happy event,"" said the palace. Ryk Neethling, a fellow South African Olympic swimmer said: ""I just spoke to her assistant and whatever the story is, it's not true. ""I called her and asked if everything is okay, and they said everything is fine."" Glamorous past Charlene Wittstock was born in Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, moving to South Africa with her family at the age of 12. She represented South Africa at the Commonwealth Games before competing in Sydney as part of the women's medley relay team that finished fifth in the final. Prince Albert was also an athlete, competing in bobsleigh in five Olympics. The Prince and Ms Wittstock made their relationship public by appearing together at the Turin Winter Olympics of 2006, after meeting in 2000 at a swimming event in Monaco. She ended her swimming career in 2007 and has travelled widely for charity events with her fiance. The tiny principality, which covers about 2 sq km (less than one square mile), is the world's smallest independent state after the Vatican City. It has seen glamorous weddings in the past. In 1956 the Hollywood beauty Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier. The wedding ushered in an unprecedented era of glamour that ended with her death in a car crash in 1982.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Julie Walker and son Lucas named as Aberdeen beach victims,"Six-year-old Lucas Walker was paddling in the water when he was swept out to sea. His mother, 37-year-old Julie Walker, tried to save him. The pair, from Aberdeen, were both taken to hospital but did not survive. Lucas's 13-year-old brother, Samuel, was also pulled from the water, along with a man and a woman. All three tried to save Ms Walker and her son. Police Scotland said Samuel was making a ""steady recovery"" in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. A 25-year-old woman and 28-year-old man have been discharged. Four other people have died in separate incidents in the seas around Britain over the weekend, with strong winds and high tides being blamed. Ch Supt Campbell Thomson said police were continuing to investigate a ""very tragic incident"", with officers searching the beach and nearby rocks. ""It is clear heroic attempts were made to save Julie and Lucas by both on and off-duty police officers, emergency service personnel and members of the public, facing treacherous sea conditions and high winds during their rescue bid,"" he said. ""Their brave efforts cannot be overstated. ""I'd like to pay special tribute to Lucas's brother Samuel, who very bravely entered the water in an attempt to rescue his mother and brother."" Ch Supt Thomson urged people to be extremely careful near any body of water as conditions could change rapidly, even during the summer months. The emergency services were alerted to the incident at about 16:45 Saturday. One witness described the scene as ""absolute chaos"" and said she had seen bodies floating in the water. Another witness, Emma Anderson, told the BBC she had heard sirens and police ""frantically"" telling people to evacuate the area. ""The whole boulevard was covered in ambulances and police. We overheard there was a body in the water and we saw what seemed to be the body of a small child floating lifelessly in the sea,"" she said. ""This is something that will forever be in my mind. Not something I ever expected to see on a fun day out with my kids. Heartbreaking for all involved.""

Aquamarine Power hails Oyster wave device test results,"The Edinburgh-based firm spent months testing the device at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney. It said operational data verified that the Oyster generated power as predicted in wave tank and numerical tests. The tests, conducted last year, included operating during major storms with waves of up to 8m. The initial results have been published in a blog post by Aquaramine's chief technical officer. Aquamarine chef executive John Malcolm said: ""These exceptional results have been gathered in more than 750 distinct sea states encompassing 94% of Oyster's power matrix and verify, for the first time, that predictions of the energy Oyster can generate in any given sea state are accurate - and in the case of large sea states is actually greater than our original calculations. ""Very few, if any, other wave energy technologies have been able to verify as much data across as wide a range of sea states, including operations through major storms. ""In simple terms, Oyster does exactly what it says on the tin. ""As a business this gives us confidence in Oyster near shore technology, and confirms that future iterations of Oyster technology can be developed at laboratory and test tank scale - secure in the knowledge that subsequent full-scale machines will perform as predicted."" Project call In a separate development, Scotland's new research and development body for wave energy has launched a Â£7m international technology innovation competition. Wave Energy Scotland (WES) issued a project call for power take-off (PTO) systems. Successful applicants will be eligible for contracts that cover up to 100% of the cost of their project. The contracts will range from between Â£100,000 and Â£4m, depending on the maturity of the technology. Last month the Scottish government awarded Â£14.3m to WES to ""kick start"" the new marine energy body. It was set up in November last year to speed up development and encourage private investment in the industry. 'Great platform' The PTO system competitive call is the first of five calls planned over the next year, with support from the Carbon Trust, the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult and the University of Edinburgh. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said: ""This project call is the first opportunity for innovative technology developers to get involved in Wave Energy Scotland and drive the direction of the wave energy sector. ""We recognise the wide range of expertise that exists beyond the energy sector. ""Wave Energy Scotland is a great platform for a collaborative effort between various industries and gives us the chance to support developers in Scotland to produce solutions for the cost effective generation of wave energy around the world.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
A third of domestic abuse victims 'cannot get legal aid',"The Justice Select Committee said without support from a lawyer, victims found it difficult to leave abusive partners and were open to intimidation. Its report criticised the government's legal aid changes and said they had ""harmed access to justice"" for some. The Ministry of Justice said legal aid is available where it is needed and the reforms were kept ""under close review"". The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Laspo) removed legal aid from private family law, but those who can provide evidence of domestic violence are still eligible. This evidence must be from no more than two years ago. The committee heard that this requirement ""presented problems for victims"", as a court case could happen long after a relationship breakdown. Clare Laxton, public policy officer at charity Women's Aid, told the committee that some of the most common forms of domestic abuse, including emotional and psychological abuse, are difficult to evidence. 'Barriers to justice' The committee said the Ministry of Justice had failed in three of its four objectives for Laspo. There had been a ""significant rise"" in litigants in person, the Ministry of Justice had ""failed to target legal aid"" to those who need it most, and it had failed to prove that it was better overall value for money, the report said - although savings had been made. Recommendations from the committee included better information from the government on eligibility for legal aid. Committee chairman Sir Alan Beith said while the Ministry of Justice had successfully made savings, this had ""limited access to justice for some of those who need legal aid the most"". He said it was ""vitally important"" the Ministry of Justice remedied this. Jenny Beck, co-chairwoman of the Legal Aid Practitioners Group, said that it was difficult for people in crisis to obtain legal advice because of ""unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles"". ""The cuts to the legal aid system have resulted in barriers to justice for ordinary people,"" she said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said abuse victims face ""overwhelming challenges"" because of restrictions on legal aid. ""It is unacceptable that victims are left to shoulder the burden of obtaining evidence in order to protect their children or separate from their abuser,"" she said. ""Paying legal aid contributions or meeting evidence requirements that mainly focus on physical abuse create extra barriers to justice for victims of financial abuse."" A Ministry of Justice spokesman said legal aid was a ""vital part"" of the justice system. ""We protected civil legal aid so it remains available where legal help and advice is most needed,"" he said. ""It is entirely untrue to allege people who are eligible for legal aid under Laspo did not get it. ""We are keeping these reforms under close review and have already made changes to address issues raised. ""We are also undertaking a comprehensive research programme to better understand why people choose to go court and how they deal with legal problems.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BCP Council leader Vikki Slade ousted in second confidence vote loss,"Lib Dem Vikki Slade failed to win support over a Tory motion stating ""a high level of public frustration and mistrust"" in her administration. She had led Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council since May 2019, under the Unity Alliance coalition. Ms Slade, who survived the previous vote in June, accused the Conservatives of ""blatant opportunism"". The Unity Alliance - made up of Lib Dem, Poole People, Labour, Green and independent councillors - took control of the newly-formed local authority following the 2019 elections. But the council has been criticised over a number of temporary road closures and pop-up cycle route projects designed to encourage walking and travel as a response to the coronavirus pandemic under the government's Active Travel scheme. The deaths of two councillors and the departure of an independent further weakened the coalition's position. The Conservative's motion passed by 39 votes to 33 during an online meeting of the council, the Local Democracy Reporting service said. Conservative group leader Drew Mellor, said residents had been failed by a ""hapless"" administration. ""Our fears of what would come to pass have been sadly confounded as the Unity Alliance lurched within 24 hours from one crisis and one U-turn to another,"" he said. However, Ms Slade said she was ""incredibly proud"" of what her administration had achieved. ""Had we not seen the deaths of two of our colleagues the opportunity to bring a vote against us would not have come about and we would have weathered the storm,"" she said. She rejected an offer to remain as leader in a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, saying she would not be ""Poole's Nick Clegg"". A previous vote of no confidence in June was defeated on the casting vote of the council chairman. A new leader is due to be decided at a council meeting on 1 October. Analysis By Tristan Pascoe, BBC Radio Solent political reporter Vikki Slade won national recognition and praise for the way the council responded to the pandemic, helping homeless people off the streets and distributing business support grants. She was on Bournemouth Beach in June when services were completely overwhelmed by thousands of visitors and declared a state of emergency as fights broke out on the beach. But more recently the authority has been criticised for its approach to emergency travel orders. Many Tories accused the alliance of being ""anti-car"" by implementing pop-up cycle lanes and temporary road closures with little or no consultation. So the Unity Alliance experiment has ultimately failed. Less than 18 months on the Conservatives are back in power and are likely to remain there until the next elections in four years time.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kent MPs lobbied to support Thames estuary airport,"Sittingbourne and Sheppey's Gordon Henderson, Dartford's Gareth Johnson and Gravesham's Adam Holloway, all Tories, have met Daniel Moylan. ""It didn't change my mind. I still feel an airport in the Thames Estuary is the wrong option,"" said Mr Henderson. Mr Moylan said he had not put pressure on MPs to back Boris Johnson's plans. Mr Johnson, who believes a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary best solution for increasing airport capacity in south east England, gave evidence to the House of Commons transport select committee on Monday. Expand Gatwick Several plans have been put forward, including a floating airport designed by architects Gensier, another plan known as ""Boris Island"", and a proposal for a hub airport on the Isle of Grain designed by Lord Foster. Other ideas include the expansion of Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted. Mr Henderson said Mr Moylan asked to meet him a few weeks ago. ""He put forward some arguments for why I should support an estuary airport and I put forward my rebuttals in a polite but firm way,"" he said. ""There's no way that anybody can put pressure on me let alone one of Boris Johnson's sidekicks."" Mr Johnson said he had no problem with the Mayor of London lobbying MPs to try to convince them of his plan for a new airport. ""Where I disagree is that this would be a correct option,"" he said. ""I think it would be wrong both logistically and environmentally. ""We have been looking at this option since 1943 and every time, for practical reasons more than anything, it has always been ruled out."" 'Key questions' Fellow Conservative Mark Reckless, MP for Rochester and Strood, has also had a private meeting with Mr Johnson. ""There are a number of key questions - particularly what on earth they are going to do with Heathrow, how much would it cost, who would pay for it, and where would you move the gas import terminals and power stations? All of which they don't have any answers to,"" he said. Mr Moylan said the meetings with Kent's MPs were intended to explain the mayor's ideas and to hear objections. ""I am not trying to persuade people or change their minds. I just want to hear what they have got to say,"" he said. ""Some people are implacably opposed, some people are more persuadable in the long term but it isn't really an exercise in that.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Unilever: Ice cream in, personal hygiene out in lockdown","The firm said ice cream sales leapt 26% in the three months to June, but demand for shampoo and deodorant fell. It said it had seen strong ""growth in home consumption of foods, ice cream and tea"" during lockdown. But there had been ""fewer personal care occasions from going to work or socialising"". However, it said sales of some cleaning products, such as hand sanitiser, had soared as people stepped up efforts to battle Covid-19. The firm's Magnum and Ben and Jerry's brands benefited the most as people bought more ice cream to eat at home. The company - which makes the deodorant Lynx and Dove soap - had warned about shrinking personal care sales at its last trading update in April. It said that as more people worked from home, they were washing their hair less often, putting off shaving and even ditching deodorant. Four months on, it said personal care sales had continued to slump. But it reported increased demand for household cleaning products, such as Cif surface cleaners and Domestos, which campaigned to educate consumers about targeted cleaning of high-touch surfaces in the home to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. Resilient business Unilever - which owns brands such as Marmite and PG Tips tea - posted a 4% climb in first-half pre-tax profits to â¬4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) after people stockpiled toilet rolls and other consumer goods at the start of the coronavirus crisis. ""In North America and parts of Europe, there was a positive impact from household stocking in March,"" it said. ""Consumption patterns then normalised in the second quarter with heightened levels of demand for hygiene and in-home food products."" Boss Alan Jope said the results ""demonstrated the resilience of the business"", as demand from the hospitality industry for its products slumped after hotels, restaurants, cafes and bars closed. But with people buying more food to eat at home, the company saw double-digit growth in its retail foods business, with Knorr soups and Hellmann's sauces performing strongly. Unilever also confirmed plans to spin off its tea business, which includes other household brands such as Lipton and Brooke Bond. It said it would retain its tea businesses in India and Indonesia and partnership interests in ready-to-drink tea joint ventures. ""The balance of Unilever's tea brands and geographies and all tea estates have an exciting future, and this potential can best be achieved as a separate entity,"" it said.

Mahoney described the show as ""a likeable mix of music, self-deprecating chat, interviews... silly features and funny, often quite bitchy quips"". She added: ""Some of the features ramble on a bit, but otherwise this was an assured, nicely under-stated debut that made you smile."" The Independent's Adam Sherwin noted Grimshaw's ""pally pre-recorded chat with Justin Bieber"", which he said ""demonstrated 'Grimmy's' ease in the company of the teen idols whose audience demographic Radio 1 is targeting"".

Hogan conceded that ""ratings might fall but credibility will rise. It's definite progress and I daresay that in a few weeks' time, this show will be even better"". In The Mirror, Rachael Wheeler felt Grimshaw ""was naturally a little nervous throughout the show, but keen to prove that he's going to be himself - and nothing like predecessor Chris Moyles."" She wrote that the programme ""couldn't have been more different from Chris's long, ranty shows"", and concluded that ""Grimmy's first show was fast-paced, full of celebrity banter and, most importantly, fun"". David Smyth from London's Evening Standard was also a fan of the new Breakfast Show host. ""He was funny without the gags, endearingly self-deprecating. He preceded new items with: 'This might be rubbish' and instead of a cackling posse there was hip electronic music playing beneath everything he said."" But Smyth said the show was not without its flaws: ""Interviews with Harry Styles of One Direction and Justin Bieber will have attracted Britain's schoolgirls but they were the most stilted moments of the show.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lancashire County Council election: Tories gain control,"The authority had been under no overall control, with Labour the biggest party by four councillors. Nationally, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) suffered huge losses, but they did manage to gain the Padiham and Burnley West ward on Lancashire County Council from Labour. Alan Hosker beat Marcus Johnstone with a majority of 228 as, elsewhere, the Greens held Lancaster Central ward. With a 45% share of the vote, the Tories won 46 of the council's 84 seats. Among them were incredibly narrow victories in Mid-Rossendale (won by only eight votes) and Clitheroe (five). Pendle Central was a Conservative gain for Joe Cooney from the Liberal Democrats, while the Tories also picked up Rossendale South, Chorley Rural West, and Moss Side & Farington. Labour lost nine wards compared to 2013, winning 30 seats on a 35% share of the vote. Hasina Khan gained Chorley North in a rare bit of good news for the party. Jennifer Mein, the previous council leader, easily retained her Preston South East seat but was left in tears by Labour's loss of the county hall. The Liberal Democrats took four seats - losing two - while two seats were held by independents (Liz Oades in Fylde East and Paul Hayhurst in Fylde West) Compared with 2013, overall turnout rose 5% to 42%. The county council provides local government services across the region including education, health, social care and transport. Analysis: Mike Stevens, BBC Radio Lancashire The Conservatives have done it... they have overall control of Lancashire County Council. Labour haven't done as poorly as some might have predicted but they'll still be bitterly disappointed with this result. The Lib Dem surge that some had predicted hasn't arrived and they've ended up with only half the seats they've had for the past four years. As well as that Conservative majority, the big shock here today is the fact UKIP have won a seat. Alan Hosker is so far the UK's only victor. I'm told the Tories are having a meeting on Saturday to finalise arrangements but, as things stand, Councillor Geoff Driver will be the next leader of Lancashire County Council. Labour leader Jenny Mein told me: ""I just want to go home and cry"". Politics can be an unforgiving beast.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Concern at mortality rates at two Lanarkshire hospitals,"Monklands and Wishaw General Hospitals recorded higher rates than the national average during the last quarter. Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) will now investigate both, along with Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride. NHS Lanarkshire said it would work closely with the assessment and launch an action plan to make improvements. Figures published on Tuesday by ISD Scotland show that the hospital standardised mortality ratio (HSMR) in Scotland has fallen by 11.6% since the last quarter of 2007. 'Important prompt' The figures also show that Monklands and Wishaw Hospitals had high ratios for the latest quarter. NHS Scotland clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said: ""Although a high hospital standardised mortality rate is not by itself a definitive measure of the quality and safety of care, it serves as an important prompt for further investigation. ""Where HSMR suggests a potential issue, a health board must be able to demonstrate that it is taking appropriate action to investigate and resolve any problems found to be causing a higher than expected HSMR, and it is reassuring that NHS Lanarkshire is already working on an action plan to address this. ""That is why I have also commissioned Healthcare Improvement Scotland to undertake a rapid assessment, in partnership with NHS Lanarkshire, of the reasons behind the HSMR figures in Lanarkshire and to see if the improvement measures in place can be strengthened and accelerated."" The review will look to identify if there are any underlying issues which may need to be resolved at the Lanarkshire hospitals. Dr Iain Wallace, medical director for NHS Lanarkshire, said: ""Our priority is for patients to receive the highest quality of care every time and we have a clear focus on the provision of safe and effective patient care. ""We very much welcome the support and involvement of HIS to undertake an assessment of the local action plans we are progressing, along with their detailed review to identify any further improvement measures that can be implemented. HIS is expected to report its findings to the Scottish government by the end of 2013. Robbie Pearson, director of scrutiny and assurance for HIS, said: ""We will carry out a rigorous and independent review of NHS Lanarkshire. ""Our work will be driven and underpinned by a commitment to improving the safety and quality of care for patients, and patient interests will be placed first at all times."" Mr Pearson said the final report from HIS would be made public in due course.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK plans Â£3m no-deal medicine transport,"By Howard Mustoe & Joe MillerBusiness reporter It wants to hire an ""express freight service"" to transport medicines, blood and transplant tissue. But experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the deal is a ""tight"" timeframe. The government's current plan is to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a trade deal. It has smartened up its act on procurement after running up a bill of Â£80m trying to arrange ferry contracts in the event of a no-deal exit. Seaborne Freight had been awarded a Â£13.8m deal last year, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. Gus Tugendhat, founder of Tussell, a data provider on UK government contracts, which uncovered the latest move said timelines were ""still tight"". Andrew Dean, director of public law at Clifford Chance, a former government adviser and procurement law expert said there was sufficient time to run a compliant and robust procurement process, but it would be tricky, given the relatively short timeframe. Last weekend, it emerged that the Department for Transport was asking logistics companies to bid to provide extra freight capacity to be used in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 'Within the guidelines' The plan is to set up ""an express freight contingency arrangement to support continuity of supply of medicines and medical products,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told Parliament. ""This will be an urgent contingency measure for products requiring urgent delivery, within a 24-48 hour timeframe, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal."" Together with stockpiling and helping companies with paperwork at the border, the department hopes this will allow patients to receive the medicines they need, especially rarer ones with short shelf-lives, which may require specialist transport conditions such as refrigeration. ""Government will only pay for capacity as and when it is needed and used,"" Mr Lidington insisted. It is understood that while larger pharmaceutical companies would have their own plans, smaller ones were likely to need help. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman confirmed that the contract was new, but said that the speed of the contract was ""within the usual guidelines"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russia halts Lithuania dairy imports in trade row,"Russia's consumer watchdog said the levels of yeast and mould in Lithuanian dairy produce were unacceptable. Lithuania is already involved in a bitter dispute with Russia over the cost of Russian gas, which Moscow's former Soviet bloc allies rely on. Lithuania is leading EU efforts to sign new trade deals with those countries. Russia's consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor has previously imposed various bans on food and drink imported from former Soviet neighbours, for example on wine from Georgia and Moldova, citing health concerns. In July Russia halted imports of chocolate from the big Ukrainian firm Roshen. Such actions have been widely seen as Russia using trade to put political pressure on its neighbours. In recent weeks Russian customs officers have imposed time-consuming checks on Lithuanian lorries on the Russian border, leading to long delays and queues. Last week Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius warned that Vilnius could retaliate on the border with Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave surrounded by Lithuania and Poland. The city of Kaliningrad is a major port on the Baltic. Speaking to Reuters news agency, Mr Linkevicius said: ""The Kaliningrad region is isolated, geographically isolated, so we could apply some measures also to cut something"". ""We could cut off trains, but not only trains, also the supply of goods, whatever. It is theoretically possible. It was not discussed, it's not our way of thinking, it's not our methods,"" he said. The European Commission is investigating Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom over alleged market-rigging in Eastern Europe. Last week Lithuania's Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said that in 2006-2012 the cost of Russian gas had soared by 600%, seriously undermining Lithuania's competitiveness. EU forges closer ties Russia is a major export market for Lithuanian dairy produce, the bulk of which is cheese, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reports. In 2012 Lithuania exported 370,000 tonnes of dairy produce to Russia, worth $193m (Â£120m). Russia is one of Lithuania's main trading partners, along with Germany, Latvia and some other European countries. The EU received 60% of Lithuanian exports in 2012, while 58% of Lithuania's imports came from the EU. The EU and Ukraine are preparing an association agreement, with plans to sign it in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in late November. Such agreements, along with a free trade partnership, are seen as key steps towards eventual EU membership. Moldova and Georgia - also former Soviet republics - may initial association agreements with the EU. Russia has been urging former Soviet republics to join a Russian-led customs union, and Armenia recently said it would do so. The EU had been expecting Armenia to sign an association agreement, and told Yerevan that it could not join both trade blocs. Only Belarus and Kazakhstan have joined Russia in the customs union so far, which Russian President Vladimir Putin sees as a step towards a ""Eurasian union"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: London key workers to star on cover of British Vogue,"A London Overground train driver, an east London midwife and a King's Cross supermarket worker will all feature on July's front page. Photographer Jamie Hawkesworth captured the trio of women for a 20-page portfolio for the fashion magazine. ""They represent the millions of people in the UK who, at the height of the pandemic, put on their uniforms and went to help,"" Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful said. ""This moment in history required something extra special, a moment of thanks to the new front line."" Rachel Millar, 24, has worked as a community midwife at Homerton Hospital, in east London, for almost three years. She was on shift on one of the delivery suites at the hospital when a team from Vogue came in to take portraits of numerous staff for what she believed was to be a feature on NHS staff. Talking to the BBC, Rachel, who lives in Leyton, described being on the cover of British Vogue as ""surreal"". ""I'm a bit overwhelmed - but in a good way. I had no idea it would be what I now know it is,"" she said. ""I've had so many lovely comments about it and I think people have enjoyed seeing someone from the NHS on the cover. ""I feel it has given the NHS a lot of recognition and a lot of love to jobs that were perhaps previously overlooked."" Narguis Horsford, who has worked for Transport for London for 10 years and driven London Overground trains for the past five, said her manager called her to ask if she would like to do an interview for the magazine. ""At first I thought he was winding me up,"" she said. ""But it later turned out to be very real."" Narguis, who lives Bounds Green, north London, said: ""I feel amazing to be representing the female front-line key workers. ""It's very important to highlight the hard work and contributions that we do to keep London moving and to provide services that everyone needs. ""NHS workers are obviously very important, but it's also good to highlight other workers in other sectors."" Nargius said she initially felt anxious going to work during the coronavirus outbreak but has since gone on to feel an immense sense of pride. ""I am proud to be a key worker and proud to be a train driver, taking those important workers to work."" Also featuring on the cover is Anisa Omar, who works as supermarket assistant at the London King's Cross branch of Waitrose. The 21-year-old, who lives in Islington with her parents, said the pandemic has given her a new sense of pride in her work. ""My job was not something that was that big of a deal before,"" she said.

British Steel in talks with government to avert collapse,"Sources close to owners Greybull Capital say its future will be discussed at ""ministerial level"". British Steel has admitted it needs further financial support from the government to help it address ""Brexit-related issues"". One possibility is a Â£75m government lifeline to the company. Otherwise, ministers can decide to nationalise the firm or see it fall into administration. On Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations continued as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" to its financial troubles. A spokeswoman said: ""As the business navigates the significant uncertainties caused by Brexit, and explores options to strengthen the business for the long term, we are pleased to confirm that we have the required liquidity while we work towards a permanent solution."" British Steel is the UK's second largest steel firm, employing 4,500 people and about 20,000â indirectly via its supply chain. In April, the firm was forced to borrow Â£100m from the government to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. However, concerns about its future were raised this week after Sky News reported that insolvency experts had been lined up in case the firm could not secure further government funding. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. Weak pound British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. Greybull Capital, a private equity firm, rescued Tata Steel's long products business during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It has since rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. The concerns come days after Tata signalled its planned merger with German rival Thyssenkrupp was off, raising fresh doubts about its Port Talbot site. Tata, which admitted it is facing tough operating conditions in the UK, promised to keep its UK plants running, but only if they could be profitable.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lagarde warns UK of pain ahead as Brexit approaches,"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter Christine Lagarde told the BBC the Brexit process would be complicated. She said that although the UK economy had performed more strongly than the IMF had predicted, uncertainty over the terms of the deal ""is always a risk"". Any deal with the EU will ""not be as good"" as membership, she said. ""When you belong to a club, whatever that is, the members of the club have a degree of affinity and particular terms under which they operate,"" Ms Lagarde told me at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""Someone outside the club has different access."" I asked her if she agreed with the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, that any future UK/EU agreement ""necessarily needs to be inferior to membership"". Malta presently holds the rotating presidency of the EU. Clarity ""If being part of a club is optimising and leveraging your membership [leaving the club] would not be as good, yes,"" she said. Ms Lagarde welcomed the prime minister's speech on Tuesday - saying that Britain wanted to leave the single market - for providing clarity. ""Better clarity, less uncertainty is certainly better for the UK economy and for the rest of the European Union,"" she said. But she warned that there were still many questions to be answered. ""The terms under which the [agreement] will be facilitated, over what period of time - question mark,"" she said. ""Over what kind of transition period - question mark. ""It is only when those questions are better clarified that we will understand how the UK economy is going to pan out. ""We are still of the view that it will not be positive all along and without pain."" Downside risks Before the referendum result, Ms Lagarde said a vote to leave the EU would have consequences ranging from ""quite bad to very, very bad"". Since the referendum, the UK economy has performed strongly and the IMF has admitted that it was too pessimistic. Earlier this week, the IMF upgraded Britain's growth forecast for 2017. I asked Ms Lagarde if her ""quite bad to very, very bad"" analysis was wrong. She said that the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates after the referendum had supported the economy and that consumers had remained far more confident than expected. But she said that there were still downside risks ahead. ""Once uncertainty clears and if people feel that their ability to set up shop in the UK and their ability to operate throughout the geographical area that is the European Union is not working as well as it did - the investment decision will change. ""In the same vein, if exports are subject to significant tariffs, restrictions and so on, the ability of the UK to activate that trade engine is going to be reduced. ""So while we have upgraded our forecast for 2017, we have downgraded for 2018.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US 'may free Israel spy Jonathan Pollard',"A US official told the New York Times that no decisions had been made, but confirmed there had been discussions. Israel would have to make significant concessions to the Palestinians in return, reports said. Pollard, a former US Navy intelligence analyst, was jailed for life in 1987 for passing documents to Israel. US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to the region on Monday for urgent talks. He held two meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and had discussions with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, before flying out after only several hours. None of the sides have commented on the talks. It is the second time that Mr Kerry has interrupted his schedule to press Israel and the Palestinians to extend the direct peace talks beyond 29 April - the deadline set last summer when they resumed after a three-year hiatus. 'On the table' His plan has been derailed by a dispute over the release of a fourth batch of 26 long-term Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Mr Abbas had insisted that they be freed by 29 March, in keeping with a promise made by Israel before the direct negotiations resumed. Israeli officials have said they are reluctant to proceed unless the Palestinians commit to extending the talks, and stressed that the releases have always been tied to their progress. The previous three releases were deeply unpopular with the Israeli public because many of the prisoners were convicted of murdering Israelis. The possible release of Pollard has reportedly emerged as an incentive for Israeli co-operation. Like his predecessors, Mr Obama has refused to release the 59-year-old despite repeated pleas from Israeli leaders. However, last year he told Israeli TV that he would make sure his sentence would be ""accorded the same kinds of review"" as every other American prisoner. Officials familiar with the negotiations told the New York Times that Pollard's possible release was one element in discussions about a broader arrangement that had not yet been reached and that the president would need to approve. Two people close to the talks told the Associated Press that in return for such a move, Israel would have to undertake significant concessions to the Palestinians. Concessions could include some kind of construction freeze at Jewish settlements on occupied territory, the release of further batches of Palestinian prisoners, and a guarantee not to pull out of the talks. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to discuss any possible deal over Pollard. ""He is a person who is convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence. I don't have any updates on his situation,"" he told a news conference on Monday. Israel's government has also not commented, but senior Israeli sources told the Maariv newspaper that the ""Pollard issue is on the table"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors,"By Zoe KleinmanReporter, BBC News Nadine Dorries was giving a statement in Parliament, on the Cumberlege review, published on Wednesday. The review, which had heard from about 700 women, focused on vaginal mesh to treat incontinence, an oral pregnancy test and an epilepsy medicine. Its report was ""harrowing"", she said. Severe pain ""I would like to make an apology to those people on behalf of the health and care sector for the time the system took to listen and respond to those women, their children and their families,"" Ms Dorries said at the beginning of her statement. However, she did not commit to any immediate action, saying the government would issue a full response as soon as possible. Women said they had been ignored when telling doctors of severe pain after having vaginal mesh fitted. Others said their children had been born with defects as a result of two different drugs: The review found their concerns had often been dismissed as ""women's problems"". ""One simple core theme that runs through all of this - two words - 'listening' and 'humility',"" Ms Dorries said. ""So much frustration and anger from patients and families stems from what they see as an unwillingness to listen. ""We need to make listening a much stronger part of clinical practice."" She said that women often ""struggle to get their voices heard"", and reading the report had left her ""shocked and incredibly angry and most of all determined to make the changes needed to protect women in the future"". Dr Sue Black OBE, who had her mesh partially removed in 2018 after years of health problems, said the government needed to take immediate action. ""The one word that's missing is 'action',"" she said. ""Action needs to be taken now to set up centres to support and help women whose lives have been damaged by having mesh implanted in the first place, the issues caused by the mesh and then, when they've gone for help, they've been gaslighted and often told they are imagining the pain."" Torn through Dr Black said after having it implanted, in 2005, she had a range of ""strange"" symptoms, including insatiable thirst, problems urinating and purple lumps on her body. Years later, she discovered the mesh had torn through her urethra. And doctors were unable to remove it completely because it had become embedded in her body. ""I'll never be completely better,"" she said. ""And I would say I am a best-case-scenario situation."" Health problems Dr Black belongs to the Sling the Mesh campaign group on Facebook, which has 8,500 members. In 2019 she was had to withdraw as a candidate in the London mayoral election, representing the Women's Equality Party, because of her continuing health problems. ""I realised I didn't have the energy for the campaign,"" she said. ""I sat at home in tears all day after making the decision.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Donegal crash: Mullan family funeral hears there are 'no words and no answers',"By Keiron TourishBBC News NI John Mullan, 49, his six-year-old daughter Amelia, and 14-year-old stepson Tomas died in the crash. Their mother, Geraldine Mullan, managed to escape and raise the alarm. She told their funeral in County Donegal that her children were found in each other's arms. ""Everybody who knows my dear son Tomas knows what a good brother he was to his sister,"" she told mourners at St Pius X Church in Moville. ""He was the best big brother right until the end."" Geraldine Mullan also described how ""unfortunately everything was against us that night"", telling the service there was inclement weather, roadworks and slippery conditions. She added that ""anyone who knows John knows you couldn't get a safer driver"" and that the accident was not from ""speed or reckless driving"". ""I know my dear husband tried everything he could to get out and the injuries he sustained unfortunately pinned him in and he couldn't,"" she said. ""All John was about was his family; he loved each one of us unconditionally."" Several hundred friends and neighbours lined the main street in Moville as the coffins were brought into the church. Parish priest Fr Pat O'Hagan told mourners there was a sadness and grief palpable in the community and nowhere more so than in the heart of Geraldine Mullan who had lost her husband and two children. 'Outpouring of love' A range of groups came out to form a guard of honour, including the children's two schools as well as the Sea Scouts - of which Tomas was a member - and a local GAA club. The family had enjoyed an evening out across the border at an bowling alley before the accident near Quigley's Point on Thursday just before 22:30 local time. Local people in Moville lined the street to pay their respects as the three coffins were brought into chapel for requiem Mass, with Covid-19 restrictions observed. Fr O'Hagan said there had been a ""universal outpouring"" of support for Geraldine, and that he had received messages from ""England, Italy, Nigeria, Brazil and Australia"". ""There's been an outpouring of love especially for you, Geraldine, in your loss,"" he said. He spoke about the connection the family had with the church and in the local community, saying that TÃ³mas was an alter server for four years at the church. Fr O'Hagan described Amelia as a ""typical girl of her age"" who was ""always enjoying whatever she was doing"". ""John met and fell in love with Geraldine when she was nursing his late mother, Philomena, whose 10th anniversary was last Thursday, a date forever etched in the minds and memories of the Mullan family, and now the Connaughton family too,"" he said. ""He and Geraldine became devoted not only to each other as husband and wife and as best friends, but to their children, as good, honest, hardworking parents who were bringing their children up and teaching them by their own good example to be people of faith.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: West Midlands universities plan lockdown lectures,"The University of Wolverhampton and Keele University in Staffordshire both said teaching would continue online. However, students in some subjects will have to wait for some lessons to become possible again, the universities said. Meanwhile, some students have refused to pay for accommodation after pointing out they are currently forbidden to travel to and from campuses. The University of Wolverhampton said the majority of learning would remain online until mid-February. It said it would update students once it has had more government guidance. Vice-chancellor Geoff Layer said: ""Students on our critical worker courses, including nurses, social workers, paramedics and teachers will have access to face-to-face practical teaching as planned."" The professor also promised to continue to communicate directly with students and staff on a daily basis. 'Back-loaded' Professor Trevor McMillan, vice chancellor of Keele University, said: ""Perhaps there are things we can do online and keep that momentum going. ""[But] some things like laboratory classes are inevitably going to be back loaded so that they'll be done in a more concentrated way later on in the year when hopefully the lockdown finishes and we can get back to more face-to-face activity."" Some students have reacted amenably to the developments, as England begins its third national lockdown. Keele student Erin Sohnrey said: ""I get to do [learning] at home with a cup of tea in my hand whenever I'm ready to do it, but I'm definitely going to miss working in teams with the other students on case studies and things like that."" But other students said they were unhappy about the uncertainty while others are refusing to pay their university accommodation fees for the new term, which are due this week. Gavin Hira, a first year student at Birmingham City University, said: ""Students are paying up to Â£7,000 for accommodation that they cannot commute to or from, is not their current residence and where there is no access to facilities."" The National Student Union said: ""All student renters must now be offered rent refunds and the option of leaving their tenancy early."" Birmingham City University is yet to comment on the matter of accommodation, But Wolverhampton University said: ""The situation is fast moving so we will keep this under constant review and will let students know of any changes.""

Cladding: MPs fail in bid to change fire safety payment rules,"The Fire Safety Bill - to strengthen regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire - comes after financial help was granted to install better cladding. But flat owners say they still face costs of up to Â£50,000 for other works and insurance premiums. More than 30 Conservative MPs support an amendment to the England-only bill. But there was not time in the Commons on Wednesday for the move - opposed by the government, which said it was preparing fuller plans to help those with large costs - to go to a vote. Labour accused ministers of insulting ""people across the country"". But another amendment - calling for a ban on freeholders passing fire safety improvement costs on to leaseholders - did go to a vote, and was beaten by 340 to 225. The bill now goes to the House of Lords, which has previously disagreed with the Commons on several changes to it. The Grenfell Tower fire of 2017 killed 72 people, with the west London building later revealed to have been covered in combustible cladding. Inspectors subsequently found many other blocks were unsafe and thousands of flat owners have since faced large bills for safety improvements, such as changes to emergency exits. In the Commons, Conservative MP Royston Smith said the housing market was at risk of partial ""collapse"", with many leaseholders unable to sell. He urged MPs to ""think very carefully before they abandon thousands of constituents"", warning: ""They will not forget and they will not forgive."" But Home Office minister Kit Malthouse said the Fire Safety Bill was ""not the correct place for remediation costs to be addressed"", as the legislation's only job was to ""clarify"" that fire safety orders apply to cladding and flat entrances. He added that the Building Safety Bill, set to be introduced in the spring, would contain ""detailed and complex"" measures on payments. Earlier this month, the government announced it was putting Â£3.5bn towards removing unsafe cladding from buildings more than 18m high - on top of Â£1.6bn for cladding removal announced last year. The government also said flat owners in lower-rise blocks would be able to access loans to cover repair work, and they would not have to pay back more than Â£50 a month. Labour called on the government to ""do the right thing"". Shadow fire minister Sarah Jones said: ""It is shameful that they have voted against implementing vital fire safety measures called for by the Grenfell Inquiry, and it is an insult to people across the country that this government voted down protections for leaseholders from fire safety costs that they did not cause.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Manchester attack: Veil of quiet respect descends over city,"By Tom MullenBBC News Online Tuesday's proud show of solidarity and defiance at a vigil in Albert Square appears to have given way to a sense of deep sadness, with dozens of people pausing to read the many tributes left around the city centre. Among the cards and flowers at St Peter's Square, a T-shirt emblazoned with a Union Jack reads simply ""Isis coward"". A large placard reads: ""You will not win. We stand together"". Manchester attack: Latest updates As well as the anger and sadness, father-of-one Mark Paxton says he sensed a nervousness among the morning commuters. ""I think in many ways people are now reflecting, and even pausing to consider their own personal safety,"" he said. ""I certainly felt that here today. No-one knows quite what to make of everything that's happened. ""There's a sense of people getting back to their lives now, because that's what we must do, but I think it's important to take a breath, take time to reflect. ""It makes you think about your own family too. I have a little boy who's six. I said to him earlier, 'I love you. You do know that, don't you?'."" German tourist Christoph Schmidt arrived in the city earlier as part of a two-part visit to Manchester and Liverpool. He said it is hard to describe how it feels arriving in a city in shock. ""It's just unbelievable,"" he said. ""I have a small family and I love them very much, so that makes it even more hard to think about. ""I can see the aim of the Manchester people is to carry on living as normal, and that's the right thing to do."" Many people returning to work say they have been touched by the compassion and consideration shown by bosses and managers. Mr Paxton, who has lived in and around the city since 2005 and works in advertising, said he was urged to work from home the day after the bombing. ""There have been lots of supportive emails going around, and lots of friendly conversations,"" he said. ""We have colleagues in London who've obviously been through this kind of thing before, so that's something too. ""I think people understand that it's important to take a breath."" Emma Wrigley, a 24-year-old PA from Chadderton, said people are ""struggling to process"" what's happened. ""It's just a funny feeling. It's so quiet around the city today.

BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor BT said in time it expected 50% of all its 5G traffic to be transmitted via the Swedish company's kit. The move will let it ditch Huawei without becoming totally dependent on its other radio access network (Ran) equipment provider, Nokia. It follows a government ban of the Chinese company's products. Ministers announced in July that all the UK's mobile providers must stop buying new Huawei 5G telecoms infrastructure after 31 December, and must also remove any of its 5G equipment purchased before that date by 2027. This was a result of sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims Huawei poses a national security threat - something the company denies. BT is already in the process of using Ericsson products to replace Huawei's equipment in its ""core"" - the most sensitive parts of its network that route data and voice calls across computer servers to get them to the right destination. Huawei released a report earlier on Wednesday, claiming its UK ban could cost thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of lost economic benefits as a result of the 5G rollout taking longer to complete. The latest announcement had been widely expected, as BT and other mobile network providers typically use two Ran equipment vendors. This allows them to maintain a service if a problem develops in one of the provider's systems, while still enjoying efficiency savings from not having to maintain and install a wider range of products. Other companies, including NEC and Samsung, are also active in the sector. But it would have been more complicated to have tried to integrate their solutions. Some industry leaders have privately expressed concern that Huawei's exit from the market could reduce competition, resulting in the 5G upgrade becoming more expensive. ""It raises concerning questions about vendor diversity as operators become reliant on a seemingly ever-diminishing number of leading suppliers,"" commented Kester Mann from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Vendor choice is important for a healthy ecosystem - it can spur innovation and help bring down costs."" In the longer term, another solution known as OpenRan is being explored. This refers to a plan to eventually standardise the hardware used in radio access networks so that one supplier can be switched for another via software alone. This would avoid the need to rip out one firm's customised equipment and replace it with another's.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ex-Celtic Boys Club coach 'touched player's thigh in car',"The witness, who played for the team in the 1980s, told a jury the incident happened while Mr Torbett was driving. Mr Torbett, 71, denies sexually abusing four boys between over a nine-year period. The High Court in Glasgow heard he is alleged to have abused the man on one occasion between 1 June, 1985 and 30 June, 1986. 'Panicky' The 45-year-old witness said: ""He touched my leg. He ran his hand up and I had to pull his hand away. He touched up to my groin, but I drew his hand away, I got a bit panicky."" The man insisted the alleged incident happened on the M8, near Airdrie, when Mr Torbett was his team manager. He told prosecutor Sheena Fraser: ""I think it was in 1986 to 1987."" The court also heard four other boys were in the car at the time. Defence QC Tony Graham said: ""I have to suggest to you you have never been in Jim Torbett's car in your life."" But the witness replied: ""I have been in his car."" 'Very uncomfortable' The witness also claimed that Mr Torbett made young footballers walk naked from the dressing room to the showers at Barrowfield Training Ground. He said: ""Mr Torbett used to say Celtic Boys' Club is a family and you don't take your underwear off in the shower room. You take them off in the dressing room. ""People started doing it, but they felt uncomfortable. Mr Torbett used to stand and watch everyone going into the showers."" Ms Fraser asked the witness if he felt uncomfortable. He replied: ""Yes, very uncomfortable."" School uniform Another witness claims Mr Torbett sexually abused him 30 years ago as he wore his school uniform. The 35-year-old told the court that this took place at the Trophy Centre factory in Shawbridge Street, Glasgow, between August 1988 and 30 June, 1990, when he was aged between four and six. He said: ""I was instructed by Mr Torbett to take my shorts and underwear down. He stood looking at me for a while. It seemed like ages. He said everything was fine and then left the room."" The witness told Ms Fraser that on another occasion the accused touched him on the groin while he looked at his homework. He also claimed that Mr Torbett often touched him on the bottom. He said that the alleged abuse took place in a large office at the premises. Defence QC Tony Graham said: ""The large office was for admin staff and there would always be a number of people there."" The witness replied: ""On some occasions yes, but, on other occasions I was on my own with Mr Torbett."" The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chevron: Indigenous Ecuadoreans seek higher damages,"By Irene CaselliBBC News, Ecuador A triumphant atmosphere might have been expected as they gathered for a news conference in Quito, given the favourable verdict finally reached in a case that had been going on more than 17 years. But the mood was somewhat sombre. ""This is the beginning,"" said Guillermo Grefa, head of the Quichua indigenous community of Rumipamba, Orellana province, some 360km (225 miles) east of Quito. ""Our pachamama [Mother Earth] is dead,"" he said. ""The fine is not going to be enough for us to restore the forest and to fix the damage. ""We will keep on fighting."" 'More needed' Many observers were surprised by the plaintiffs' decision to appeal against Monday's sentence. Judge Nicolas Zambrano ruled that Chevron must pay damages of $8.6bn (Â£5.4bn), plus a further 10% of that sum in reparations to the Amazon Defense Coalition, the group formed to represent the plaintiffs. The largest amount, more than $5bn, goes to soil restoration, while over $2bn should be spent on healthcare. The judgement says Chevron is responsible for health problems, such as cancer and skin disease, reported by the plaintiffs. But the plaintiffs said that a court-appointed expert had fixed the total amount of reparations at $27bn, while more recent assessments made by their lawyers brought the damages up to $113bn. The leaders said they were not seeking larger compensation out of greed. They say the court's judgement clearly established what the money is needed for. Emergildo Criollo, leader of a Cofan tribe in the area, travelled to Quito to express his rejection of the sentence. Two of his children died, one aged six and one aged three, as a result of drinking contaminated water, he said. ""You can't recover dead people, there is no price for that,"" he said. ""Our demand is to get enough money to clean up our Amazon."" There has been no reaction from the Ecuadorean government so far. President Rafael Correa has been extremely cautious after Chevron accused the government of political interference in the case. For its part, Chevron says it will also reject the damages award - but on the grounds that it amounts to ""extortion"". The company also says it has already spent millions of dollars on the clean-up and has a signed agreement with Ecuador absolving it of further responsibility. But at the news conference Alberto Acosta, a former energy minister under Mr Correa, said the ruling sent an important signal to the oil industry. ""This is a message to all those opportunistic oil and mining companies. This can show them what can happen if they keep destroying nature and human life,"" said Mr Acosta.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China morning round-up: Illegal workers,"Shanghai Daily says Vice-Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning told the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Wednesday that the crackdown will include improving visa policies and strengthening border controls. People's Daily says police agencies across the country have investigated some 20,000 incidents of foreigners illegally entering, living or working in mainland China. Those working without a proper visa were mainly involved in foreign language education, acting, housekeeping for expatriates and labour intensive industries, it said. Beijing News says Mr Yang said the police ministry would set up repatriation facilities in regions that have large numbers of such illegal foreign workers. China Daily and People's Daily continue their coverage of the ongoing European tour by Premier Wen Jiabao, as he arrived in the Polish capital, Warsaw. A front page commentary in the People's Daily Overseas Edition said it was the right time for European countries to ""deepen"" their co-operation with China as Chinese leaders conducted a series of high-profile visits in the region. In the wake of the tours by Mr Wen and Politburo member Dai Bingguo, Vice-Premier Li Keqiang will also embark on a visit to Russia, Hungary, Belgium and the European Union headquarters in Brussels, the commentary said. In the South China Sea, the Global Times says the ongoing stand-off between Chinese and Filipino vessels over the disputed Scarborough Shoal ""bubbled up"" on Wednesday, as the Philippines and the US began a joint military drill. Three vessels in total are still at the shoal, Beijing News reports, while China Daily said Deputy Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai had appealed for restraint from parties involved. ""China did not start the current stand-off in the South China Sea. We would not like to see more tensions in that region,"" Cui Tiankai said. China was still committed to resolving disputes in the region through dialogue and diplomacy, he said. A People's Daily report filed from the Philippines claims local residents do not agree with politicians' approach to the conflict. And a commentary from the same paper attacks ""some countries'"" attempts to ""internationalise"" the South China Sea dispute as a ""strategically short-sighted"" act. Papers ranging from the Beijing Times to the Hong Kong Standard also go big with the arrival of a 2,500-year-old skull fragment believed to be that of Sakyamuni the Buddha in Hong Kong. This is the first time that the relic has been shown outside mainland China. Gyaltsen Norbu, the Beijing-backed 11th Panchen Lama, is in Hong Kong to bless the relic.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'I'm gay and I was sexually assaulted by a woman',"By Shiona McCallumNewsbeat reporter He says he ""didn't feel under threat"" by his attacker, Cheryl Cottrell, because she was a woman. The film-maker, who is gay, has been struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts since it happened. Cheryl Cottrell, 29, was put on the sex offenders register and sentenced to 120 hours' community service after a trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court in August. Rape Crisis Scotland say one per cent of survivors contacting them for support have been abused by a woman. WARNING: FRANK'S ACCOUNT OF THE CRIME CONTAINS SOME GRAPHIC DETAILS Frank, who's 36, is entitled to anonymity because he's the victim of a sexual crime. He's decided to waive that to encourage other victims of sexual offences to come forward. ""I've been in positions before when a girl has been drunk and is holding on to you, and that's fine,"" he says. ""I identified myself as being gay straight away but she didn't believe me. I kept moving her hands and she kept touching my nipples and biting my ears."" Frank, who was nominated for a Bafta for his film Looking After Mum, says things got more serious as his attacker drank more alcohol. ""Something fell off the worktop in the kitchen and I bent over to pick it up. I had very loose trousers on and a bit of a builder's bum showing from what I can imagine. ""She just grabbed me and put her hands right down my trousers and shoved her fingers really violently up inside me. I was shocked. ""It didn't last for long but I jumped away and I was like, 'What the hell are you doing?' ""It was awkward, it was painful, it was invasive and it was mind-numbing."" Frank says he has suffered severe anxiety flashbacks and PTSD since the assault. The stress and trauma of the court appearances meant he had to take time out from his music and film-making. ""Some mornings I just couldn't get out of bed because I was just frozen,"" he says. ""You end up feeling like you're the only person in the world that this is happening to. Especially being a man, I thought this doesn't happen to other men, it can't."" Since waiving his right to anonymity Frank has had hundreds of supportive messages from people across the world. ""I've been quite lucky. Since I've spoken about what happened, Jeremy Kyle called me to say he thought I was really brave. I've had well wishes from Lorraine Kelly, and Whoopi Goldberg. ""I was in tears hearing them say they were looking up to me. It shows you the impact you can have by sharing your story. Hollywood or Glasgow, we're all just people.""

Brexit: Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity',"Construction work on a site off the M20 near Ashford began earlier this month. One resident labelled the plans ""sneaky"", stating she had not been told about them. The Department for Transport said ""commercial sensitivities made it impossible to consult"". The government recently acquired the 27-acre site near Ashford and there are fears it will be used to contain thousands of lorries waiting to travel to continental Europe and for border-related checks. 'Not told anything' Carla Hopkins, who lives nearby, met Labour's Brexit spokeswoman Rachel Reeves at the site and told her that residents had had no warning about the plans. She said: ""We weren't told anything. It was sneaky. ""First we knew was the sign that went up a few weeks ago saying the footpath had been closed."" She said she is worried about the pollution the ""concrete monstrosity"" will cause and the loss of another piece of countryside forever. Meanwhile, Ms Reeves said Britain is ""staring down the barrel of Brexit"" with only five months left until the end of the transition period. She said: ""The Government said this was going to be the easiest ever trade deal ever to negotiate. ""We're four years later [after the referendum] and we still don't have a trade deal. ""Well we are now at the end of July, we don't have a trade deal, all we have is a blueprint for a giant lorry park in the middle of Kent."" She warned that businesses were headed for ""serious frictions with our trade with our nearest neighbours"". 'Solve the problem' Richard Lavender, president of Kent Invicta Chamber of Commerce, said that from a business perspective the lorry park has ""got to be"" in that location because of the proximity to the motorway and junction 10a. He added: ""Somewhere we need three or four of these throughout Kent, the problem being that our infrastructure just closes down if there's a fishermen's strike in Calais; no cross-Channel ferries and things like that and we come to a grinding halt in this county every single time. ""Therefore businesses get on to me saying 'solve it, solve the problem and get these lorries off the road'."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""At the end of this year the UK will become a fully independent country and this site will form part of our ongoing plans to help ensure the free flow of freight at the border. ""While commercial sensitivities made it impossible to consult prior to acquisition of this site, a letter from Minister Rachel Maclean was hand-delivered to all properties on the perimeter earlier this month. ""We will work closely with community leaders to ensure local residents and businesses are kept informed as plans progress.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Love Island to return this summer, ITV confirms","However, the broadcaster has not announced any further details, such as the location of the villa. Previous summer series have taken place in Mallorca, but reports this week suggested ITV had identified the island of Jersey as a possible back-up. The channel has also announced a slate of new dramas and entertainment shows which will air in the coming months. Earlier this year, ITV's CEO Dame Carolyn McCall said they were ""looking at all options"" to bring Love Island back. She told the BBC's Amol Rajan: ""We will want to put Love Island on air because it's been off air for a little while, we didn't do it last summer. We're looking at all our options at the moment because the pandemic makes that hard."" The most recent series of Love Island took place in the winter, concluding in February 2020, when Paige Turley and Finley Tapp were crowned the winners. (They're still together, a year later.) That series took place just before the coronavirus pandemic, and marked the first winter run for a show which had previously only aired during summer months. Since the series has been off air, ITV2 has been broadcasting international editions of the series in its place to fill the air time, such as Love Island Australia. Laura Whitmore will likely return to hosting duties, after she previously stood in for former presenter Caroline Flack, who died last February. It's unclear how the show would operate if social distancing measures remain in place by this summer. However, it's likely that Covid-19 restrictions will be significantly reduced by then, in light of the government's four-step plan to ease most lockdown rules by June, and the continued success of the coronavirus vaccine rollout. Even if some measures are still in place, other series like Strictly have used daily testing and contestant bubbles as a way to stay on air. But the pandemic has caused significant disruption to TV productions. Both Strictly and Dancing On Ice saw contestants leave after testing positive for Covid-19, while I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here relocated from Australia to Wales. Love Island was one of several commissions ITV confirmed on Thursday, as it announced details of its summer programming. ITV also announced: The channel will also air a previously-announced new drama about the killing of Stephen Lawrence, which will star Steve Coogan as DCI Clive Driscoll.

Preston GP struck off over 'dishonest' food poisoning claims,"A tribunal found the actions of Dr Zuber Bux, who practised in the Preston area in Lancashire, were ""misleading, dishonest and financially motivated"". The panel also proved he failed to declare his wife Sehana Bux was a partner at the solicitors handling the food poisoning compensation claims. Dr Bux was immediately suspended from practising and has 28 days to appeal. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel heard Dr Bux, who has been unavailable for comment, received about 400 cases via AMS Solicitors in Preston between 2015 and 2017. There is no suggestion Mrs Bux or the solicitors were involved in wrongdoing. 'Wholly deplorable' The panel proved allegations that in four of those cases - one concerning two patients - he diagnosed food poisoning with insufficient evidence between May and September 2016. An allegation that he failed to take adequate steps to establish whether his wife's position at the firm amounted to a conflict of interest was also proven. MPTS tribunal chair Julia Oakford said Dr Bux's behaviour was ""wholly deplorable and reprehensible"". ""The holiday sickness claims misconduct involved dishonesty that was covered up, lying to solicitors, false declarations to the court, deceptive expert reports and it was financially motivated,"" she added. In a statement, AMS Solicitors said Mrs Bux was never involved in any matter where her husband was the medical expert. It said there had never been a regulatory finding against the firm or its solicitors. It added Mrs Bux left the firm last month but said her departure was not connected to the tribunal. 'Significant risk' The panel also found there were serious failings by Dr Bux in what was described by the General Medical Council as a ""reckless and cavalier"" circumcision of a 15-month-old child in 2017, which resulted in the child being taken to hospital. The panel concluded it should not have been done in a community setting, he had not obtained adequate medical history of Patient A, who had a heart condition, and he administered incorrect doses of medicine. ""Patient A was placed at significant risk of life-threatening complications that could not be dealt with in the community,"" Mrs Oakford said. Michael Hayton QC, on behalf of Dr Bux, submitted to the tribunal it was a ""one-off incident"" and he had conducted thousands of circumcisions within the community without complications. The tribunal accepted this but determined his conduct amounted to serious misconduct and erasing him from the medical register was the ""only proportionate sanction"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Teletubbies creator 'sad' about show's remake,"Wood, 77, told Radio Times she is not a fan of the trend for remaking old shows such as Dangermouse and Clangers. ""I'm a bit sad,"" she said. ""It comes down to the times we're in: people feel safer remaking hits of the past rather than investing in something new."" Wood also produced hit show In the Night Garden featuring Igglepiggle. ""There are such a lot of programmes being remade and I just feel the children's television industry is worth more than that,"" said Wood, whose new show Twirlywoos begins on CBeebies next week. ""It would be nice if more encouragement was given to new work."" 'Like my children' Woods has been responsible for many of the UK's best-loved children's programmes and characters, including Roland Rat, Rosie & Jim and Brum. The original Teletubbies, starring Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po, ran on the BBC from 1997 to 2001 and sparked a number one single called Teletubbies say 'Eh-oh!' in December 1997. Wood no longer owns the rights to the hit series, which she co-created with Andrew Davenport, as she sold them in 2013 to help fund new programmes. She said she would not be watching the new series, which is due to air on CBeebies later this year, adding: ""I couldn't bring myself to. ""I have nothing against them, it might be brilliant. They tell me they've got the best producer possible on it, so that's a good sign. ""But how could I watch it? All my programmes are like my children. It's like seeing a child remade in somebody else's image. So good luck to them."" Wood's new show Twirlywoos - a ""situation comedy for three to four-year-olds"" - features four bird-like creatures called Great BigHoo, Toodloo, Chickedy and Chick. It uses stop-frame animation rather than hand puppets or people dressed in suits and is unashamedly educational. ""Educational ideas were present in Teletubbies and In the Night Garden but much more subliminally,"" said Wood. ""This show takes in the latest educational research and builds a comedy around it - whereas in the past I've just made a comedy and just by chance some of these ideas happened to be embedded within it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Depression: 'Second biggest cause of disability' in world,"By Helen BriggsBBC News The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. ""Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now,"" she told BBC News. ""There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. ""The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries."" Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. ""There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health,"" she explained. ""What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it."" The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. ""It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. ""Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis."" The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nick Clegg 'appalled' by former school head master's abuse,"Roland Peter Wright, 83, of Crown Lane, Farnham Royal, was found guilty of abusing five boys aged between eight and 13 by an Amersham Crown Court jury. He had denied 10 charges of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child at Caldicott Preparatory School. Mr Clegg said the nature of the abuse would ""disturb everyone"". ""I am shocked and appalled by the gross betrayal of trust and violation of childhood innocence that has been shown to have taken place at Caldicott,"" said Mr Clegg. 'Devastating impact' ""These reports will disturb everyone - but most especially those, like myself, who were pupils at the school and were entirely unaware that such abuse was taking place. ""I can only imagine the devastating impact that such abuse must have had on the young boys who were affected and my heart goes out to them."" Mr Clegg attended the prestigious Buckinghamshire school between 1974 and 1980 and was joint head boy in his final year. Wright, who was headmaster for 25 years until his retirement in 1993, committed the offences between 1959 and 1970. He had been cleared of three other charges at an earlier trial. Det Sgt Joe Banfield, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""This result would not have occurred without the support of the many victims and witnesses in this case, who bravely gave evidence and provided statements."" Gross indecency Ruth Bowskill, of Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, paid tribute to the victims of those found guilty of abuse for their ""strength and tenacity in coming forward and giving evidence"". Wright's conviction, on Tuesday, comes after fellow former teachers John Addrison and Hugh Henry pleaded guilty to sex abuse, it can now be reported. Henry, 82, of Pomeroy Close, Amersham, pleaded guilty to gross indecency with a child. He is due to be sentenced with Wright, on 6 February. Addrison, 54, of Datchet Road, Slough, Berkshire, pleaded guilty to one count of indecency with or towards a child, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, at Aylesbury Crown Court in November last year.

Pound rises on Brexit 'progress' report,"Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News. However, the pound later gave up some of its gains after London and Berlin both denied there had been any change. The agency said the German government was ready to accept a less detailed agreement on future UK-EU trade ties. The UK and Germany both denied any movement, while analysts warned the EU's stance was not decided by Berlin. ""Germany does not - despite its clear dominance of the bloc economically - actually speak for the EU position,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, ""[Chief EU negotiator] Michel Barnier may well have something to say about this report. As might Theresa May,"" he added. Mrs May's official spokesman later responded by saying there was no change in the UK's position that ""proper"" information about the future UK-EU relationship had to be available by the time Parliament voted on the withdrawal deal. ""We have always set out that when Parliament votes on this, it needs to be a meaningful vote based on proper information,"" he said. ""We have always been clear that Parliament needs to be able to make an informed decision, and Parliament has also been clear on that. There is no change in that position."" A German government spokesman said: ""The government's position is unchanged. The federal government has full trust in the leadership of Michel Barnier."" Mr Barnier has not yet commented on the report. In late afternoon trading, the pound was worth $1.2902, having earlier traded closer to the $1.30 mark. Against the euro, it fell below â¬1.11, having earlier reached â¬1.1155. ""The ease with which sterling has recently spiked on slim pieces of news tells us a lot about how quickly the pound is likely to rally in the event of any type of Brexit deal,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. ""Any deal that avoids the worst-case scenario of a no-deal exit is likely to cause significant sterling strength, even if it is no more than a can-kicking exercise in the classic Brussels style.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Europe-wide police operation busts horsemeat racket,"Police in Spain made 65 arrests for crimes including animal abuse, forgery, money laundering and racketeering. Horses in Portugal and Spain deemed unfit for consumption were slaughtered and their meat passed off as edible. A Dutch businessman arrested in Belgium is said to have controlled the illegal trade from south-east Spain. He was first sought in connection with a scandal in the Republic of Ireland in 2013, when horsemeat was found in beef burgers, but his whereabouts were unknown at that time. The issue in the earlier scandal was one of food fraud rather than food safety. How big was the police swoop? Spain's Guardia Civil (police) began Operation Gazel a year ago after detecting unusual behaviour in horsemeat markets. They worked in co-ordination with Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland and the UK, Europol said in a statement. The unnamed Dutchman controlled the crime ring from Calpe in Alicante, on Spain's Costa Blanca, ""putting his most trusted men in charge in every country affected by the scam"", Europol says. Police carried out raids in both Alicante and Leon, in the north of Spain, blocking or seizing bank accounts and properties, and confiscating five luxury cars. Other charges brought against those arrested were perverting the course of justice and committing crimes against public health. How did the racket work? Horses in bad shape, too old or simply labelled as ""not suitable for consumption"" were being slaughtered in two different slaughterhouses, Europol says. Meat from the animals, which came from Portugal and several parts of northern Spain, was processed in a specific facility and from there sent to Belgium, a major horsemeat exporter. Microchips and documentation were modified by the crime group. Analysis of samples conducted in The Hague concluded the meat was destined mainly for markets outside Spain, as the samples matched others found abroad. How were horses maltreated? One of the charges brought is animal abuse but details are not yet available. However, a photo released by Europol shows one horse with a bloody slash close to its mane. How big is Europe's horsemeat market? Italy and France are the biggest consumers of equidae (horses, donkeys etc) meat, according to a report by the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2013. According to that report, Italy imported 21,693 tonnes and France 11,898 in 2012, while Belgium was the chief exporter, shipping 17,320 tonnes. Spain exported 3,910 tonnes in that period. However, the trade is small compared, for instance, to the beef market. Total EU horsemeat imports in 2012 came to 50,250 tonnes and exports 54,853, while EU beef imports in 2011 totalled 315,000 tonnes and exports - 510,200.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London minicab drivers demand more Covid-19 protection,"London's 110,000 minicab drivers are allowed to work if they are providing essential journeys. The United Private Hire Drivers Association said TFL should urgently advise drivers how to minimise the risk of catching coronavirus. Six London minicab drivers are thought to have died from the disease. Unlike black taxis, minicabs do not have screens to separate drivers from passengers. London mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""TfL are working with the private hire vehicle industry to make sure that there aren't any unintended safety hazards by these screens being fitted in a way that's dangerous to the passenger or the driver."" James Farrar, from the United Private Hire Drivers Association, said TfL should give clear guidance on how the risk to drivers could be mitigated. ""If we cannot mitigate the risk, if it's not possible and the science doesn't permit it, we need to be told that as well,"" he said. ""What we can't have is the continuation of the status quo where we're acting as if nothing has happened and drivers are dying."" BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards Bus drivers and their union successfully managed to change TfL's policy on which entrance passengers used for boarding and now minicab drivers are attempting something similar. Minicab drivers say they have been left in a policy vacuum with no measures or clear guidelines to safeguard them or passengers. They say they are not even given advice on how many passengers they can pick up. Some of them want to install plastic screens in the cars but TfL have told them not to at the moment. As 94% of drivers are black, Asian and minority ethnic, the United Private Hire Drivers Association say the lack of protection is nothing short of discrimination. Abdurzak Hadi, who has been a private hire driver since 2008 and has had the virus, said: ""I feel let down by TfL. This disease is a killer.

Coronavirus: What are UK health officials saying?,"Hugh PymHealth editor@BBCHughPymon Twitter Working closely with his counterparts in the devolved administrations, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, plays a central role in planning the UK's response to Covid-19. An infectious diseases expert, he played an important role in combating the Ebola threat. It was encouraging the number of new cases in China was declining, he said, but he worried the official number of reported cases in Iran greatly understated the reality. Italian disease control systems were ""very robust"", Prof Whitty said, but people with underlying health conditions should think hard before travelling there. The official line remains anyone returning from the north of Italy with flu-like symptoms needs to isolate themselves at home and phone NHS 111. Those returning from the designated high-risk areas should self-isolate no matter if they are showing symptoms. Significant challenges The UK, meanwhile, is still in the containment phase, with just 13 cases, including four who caught the virus on the UK Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. Public health staff have successfully traced about 700 people with whom these 13 have had close contact. But they are under no illusion a rapid global spread of the virus turning into a pandemic would raise significant challenges. And they hope if this happens the peak number of cases in the UK would be in the summer, when: Planning for hundreds of cases in the UK was advanced, Prof Whitty said, but it was no more than a possibility. ""If there was a major epidemic, there would be substantial pressure on the service,"" he said. ""But it is actually something we are already planning for, so if this happens we are in a position to get the NHS working as efficiently as possible."" A range of policy responses would be considered, Prof Whitty said, which might include asking whole families to stay at home if one of them tested positive. The next step, he said, would be to think about closing schools and parts of the public transport network and cancelling events with large crowds But the cost to the economy and society would have to be weighed up against the health benefits. ""The expectation is not that we will do all these things, the expectation is we will be looking systematically, using the science, at all the building blocks and balancing the effects against costs to society,"" he said. Prof Whitty and other system leaders are clearly prepared - but nobody can be sure how resilient the UK's health defences will be if an epidemic develops here.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Commons pays tribute to miners in Gleision tragedy,"Shadow Welsh Secretary and Neath MP Peter Hain said lessons could be learned from the Gleision tragedy for the future of mines safety and rescue. He also said during Welsh Questions that the appeal fund set up for the families was approaching Â£400,000. Police are working with the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths. David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died after the mine was engulfed by water on 15 September. Three other miners managed to escape. The last of the miners' funerals took place last week. Mr Hain thanked emergency services and workers from two other coal mines in south Wales, Aberpergwm and Unity, for their efforts in the rescue operation. Normal political hostilities were also put aside as Mr Hain thanked Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan after the UK government agreed to pay the equivalent of Gift Aid to the appeal fund - adding 25% to the total. ""I believe there are a number of important lessons from the Gleision tragedy for the future of mines safety and rescue,"" he said. ""I'm asking the secretary of state to delay the report by Professor LÃ¶fstedt, due by the end of this month, on regulations covering mining amongst other sectors, so that account can be taken of a submission I plan for her and her cabinet colleagues."" Collections Prof LÃ¶fstedt is leading a review into health and safety legislation as part of changes to support the UK government's ""growth agenda"" and to cut red tape. Mrs Gillan said the report was being written and, because it was independent, it would be ""inappropriate"" for ministers to delay its publication. But she added: ""I am sure any lessons that can be learned from the investigation into the tragic events at the Gleision mine will be incorporated into any recommendations from Professor Lofstedt's report that are taken forward by the Health and Safety Executive."" Mr Hain also revealed an appeal for the family of the four miners, which he helped set up with the South Wales branch of the National Union of Mineworkers, was approaching Â£400,000. Cash has come from a wide variety of sources including members of the public, collections at sporting events and donations from businesses. On Wednesday, about 40 curry restaurants and takeaways across south west Wales are holding a fundraising night for the appeal. Half the proceeds from the evening will go towards the fund.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sheffield shooting: Drive-by gunman guilty of attempted murder,"The boy suffered serious leg injuries when Stephen Dunford, 25, opened fire on a group of people in Northern Avenue, Sheffield, from a passing car. He was later recorded in jail saying: ""I was really trying to take him away. Then a youth got a stray."" Dunford, from Sheffield, who denied the offence, was convicted after a trial. He was also found guilty of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life in relation to the incident on 12 January and a separate shooting in Northcote Avenue two days earlier when nobody was injured. During his trial Sheffield Crown Court heard Dunford was one of a group of masked men in a white Ford Focus who opened fire on the group as they stood outside a row of shops in the Arbourthorne area of the city. The boy, who recognised Dunford, told police he saw the car drive up before ""they started shooting everywhere"" he said he then heard the gunman shout ""we got one"". The court heard doctors had been unable to remove the bullet from his thigh. A second boy narrowly avoided injury when a bullet passed through the hood of his jumper, inches from his head. Police said at the time the boy and his friends were ""innocent bystanders"" most likely caught up in a fallout between organised crime groups. 'Highly dangerous' The court heard that Dunford was later recorded rapping about the incident while in custody, at one stage talking about ""five shootings in two days"" before saying: ""Since I come jail the shooting stopped."" Dunford, who claimed he was having Sunday dinner at a relatives at the time of the shooting, was found not guilty of two further firearms offences. Julian Briggs from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""It is only by great good fortune that Dunford's actions did not result in the tragic death of the 12-year-old child. ""[He] is a highly dangerous individual and he is now facing a long jail sentence."" A co-defendant, Devon Gregory, of Heeley Green, Sheffield, was found not guilty by the judge of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was found not guilty by the jury of an offence of conspiracy to possess a firearm. A third man, Brandon Bailey, 26, of Manor Park Way, Sheffield, was convicted of conspiracy to possess a firearm and pleaded guilty during the trial to possession of criminal property after police found Â£19,700 in cash at his home.

A killer's compulsion undimmed by time,"By Graeme OgstonBBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter Sobs from the public seats from those whose lives he had changed forever, the packed press area hanging onto the judge's every word. At its centre, a disinterested figure flanked by security officers. Then, a child - now, a man, but with the compulsion to kill undimmed by the preceding decade-and-a-half. This time however, Robbie McIntosh's victim, surrounded by her family and despite the horror inflicted on her, could watch as justice was served. McIntosh's non-reaction to a sentence that will most likely see him die in jail matched that of his demeanour in 2002 at the High Court in Forfar for the murder of Anne Nicoll. Save for a brief sideways glance at reporters, the now bearded and shaven-headed McIntosh, showed all the emotion of someone reading a shopping list or checking his email. His seeming outer calm was at odds with the brutality of his actions in Templeton Woods last August and on Dundee Law in August 2001. McIntosh was given leave on 2 August last year, the 16th anniversary of the murder. Whether he would have struck on that day if he had had the chance we do not know. Sitting in the newsroom five days later it was evident something significant had happened. Templeton Woods was in lockdown. The police were cagey, something was different about this major operation. Sources soon revealed why - and it was not long before it was Dundee's worst-kept secret about who was in custody for the brutal attack on dog walker Linda McDonald. There was rage in the city. McIntosh's murder of Anne Nicoll in 2001 had shocked Dundee. A 15-year-old boy had carried out a frenzied attack on a female dog walker in a secluded area. She had been stabbed 29 times and had her head stamped on by McIntosh. He was caught after telling two shop workers there had been a murder on the Law, something only the killer could have known. Without the intervention of two passing brothers last August, McIntosh would have faced a second murder charge for an almost identical offence. The question was asked again and again in the days that followed: ""How could this have happened?"" The search for the answer to that question is under way. But McIntosh's rage, hidden away for 16 years before resurfacing at the first opportunity, is back where it belongs, behind bars, this time maybe forever.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour's prosperity pledges for election campaign,"Improved school standards, new NHS treatments and 100,000 apprenticeships were among six election pledges for prosperity unveiled by Carwyn Jones. He also promised free childcare and help for older people selling homes to pay for care if Labour wins in May. Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said they would ""scarcely paper over the cracks"" after 17 years of Labour rule. Mr Jones said Labour was offering ""a helping hand for parents, breathing space for small business, continuing improvement in schools, the latest treatments for the sick and fairness for the older generation"". The six Labour promises include: ""In 2011, I promised the people of Wales a decade of delivery,"" he said. ""I said that despite the record cuts to our budget, we would fulfil the promises we made to steer the country through tough times. ""We are half way through that journey and on the promises we made in the last election, we did deliver. ""Today I set out six new promises. Welsh Labour's pledges to the people of Wales."" Responding for the Conservatives, Mr Davies claimed Labour were stealing some of his party's policies, adding: ""These pledges will scarcely paper over the cracks, as the gap between Labour's rhetoric and its results continues to grow. ""Whilst Carwyn Jones talks of a decade of delivery, the people of Wales aren't naÃ¯ve; all Labour have delivered is disappointment. ""Under Labour, Wales endures the lowest take-home pay in the UK; spending on frontline health services has been cut by a billion pounds since 2011; and despite moderate improvements in GCSE results, they remain worse than those in England. ""So much for ambition and prosperity."" Analysis by Daniel Davies, BBC Wales political correspondent This is Labour's pitch for another five years in office - another five years to add to the 17 the party has already spent in power since devolution began. Somehow, Mr Jones must convince voters to give him more time. The pledge to create a new treatment fund follows a huge row in the assembly over funding the NHS. Opponents say Labour has cut spending, and the Tories want to see a dedicated fund for paying for cancer treatment. Labour says it has protected the budget - and claims setting aside money for cancer care would penalise patients suffering from other conditions. The 100,000 apprenticeships isn't drastically more than the number the Welsh government is creating now - 93,000 so far since the last election, one minister says. But industry insiders say if Labour maintains a steady supply of apprentice places - and the funding required - then that would be welcomed. And the schools pledge will be important to Carwyn Jones. He promised to protect funding for schools when he was elected Welsh Labour leader. But opponents say Labour has presided over a slide in standards in the classroom.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ulster Bank apologises as thousands unable to access money,"It apologised for Monday evening's problems and said it would compensate anyone left out of pocket. Customers said they could not use cash machines, debit cards or access online or telephone banking. Up to 750,000 customers from RBS, Natwest and Ulster Bank - the Royal Bank of Scotland group - were affected. All systems are now back to normal, the bank has said. The group said it was ""very sorry for the system issues"" but, as yet, it is unclear exactly what the ""glitch"" was. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the bank said: ""The systems issues that affected our customers last night have now been resolved and all our services are now back working normally. ""We would like to apologise to our customers. If anyone has been left out of pocket as a result of these systems problems, we will put this right. ""If any customer is experiencing issues this morning, they should get in touch with our call centres or come into our branches, where our staff will be ready to help."" A group spokesperson added: ""If anyone has been left out of pocket as a result of these systems problems, we will put this right."" Susan Allen, RBS director of customer relations, said: ""We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience."" Ms Allen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the group still did not know the cause of the glitch, but was working through ""a detailed analysis"". ""It is completely unacceptable that customers couldn't access their own money,"" she added. In 2012, an IT fault locked huge numbers of RBS customers out of their accounts. In Northern Ireland, thousands were unable to withdraw cash or access their Ulster Bank accounts for weeks after a software upgrade on 19 June. Ulster Bank paid out more than Â£18m in compensation to 300,000 people affected in Northern Ireland by that glitch. The RBS group, which is 80%-owned by the UK government, said it had improved its services since the problems occurred in June and July of 2012. Monday 2 December has been dubbed Cyber Monday.

Indonesia crash: Sriwijaya Air plane's flight data recorder retrieved,"The flight data recorder was brought ashore, but the teams are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder. The authorities hope that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The 26-year-old aircraft passed an airworthiness inspection last month. It was still functioning and intact before it crashed, preliminary results showed. Flight SJ182 was en route from the capital Jakarta to the city of Pontianak on Borneo island. Separately, Indonesian police have identified the first victim - Okky Bisma, a 29-year-old flight attendant. Indonesia's transport ministry on Tuesday said the aircraft had been grounded during the pandemic, and passed an inspection on 14 December. It made its first flight five days later with no passengers before resuming commercial flights on 22 December. The National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said that preliminary findings showed that the plane had reached the height of 10,900ft (3.3km) at 14:36 local time on Saturday (07:36 GMT), then made a steep drop to 250ft at 14:40, before it stopped transmitting data. KNKT head Soerjanto Tjahjono added that the plane's turbine disc had been found with a damaged fan blade - ruling out the theory that the plane had exploded mid-air. ""The damaged fan blade indicates that the machine was still functioning when it crashed. This [is] also in line with the belief that the plane's system was still functioning when it reached 250ft,"" said Mr Soerjanto in a written statement to reporters. What progress has been made so far? Search teams are continuing to comb the waters at the crash site, trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder. Earlier on Tuesday, the KNKT said a device used to locate the black boxes had experienced ""technical problems or equipment damage"". Several pieces of debris, body parts, wreckage and passengers' clothing have already been recovered. According to news wire AFP, some 2,600 personnel were involved in the search operation on Monday, along with more than 50 ships and 13 aircraft. Investigators are already analysing items which they believe to be a wheel and part of the plane's fuselage. An engine turbine has also been recovered. Safety officials say this stage of the investigation could take up to a year. What happened to the aircraft? The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed from Jakarta's main airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday. Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact was recorded. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-east Asian destinations. The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Victims' Code criticised by watchdog,"Parliamentary Ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor said investigation of complaints had exposed a lack of understanding. It came as ministers unveiled plans to revamp the code, which tells people what to expect when reporting a crime. Victims' minister Helen Grant said ""getting this right"" was a priority. 'Basic rights' Dame Julie, whose office looks into complaints of individuals being treated unfairly or receiving poor service from government departments and other public organisations, said: ""Victims, including those who have been subjected to serious crime, such as sexual assault, have spoken to us about how they have been left feeling powerless and shattered. ""Failures by agencies to recognise even the most basic rights of those victims under the code, such as being told that the charges against the defendant have changed or that an appeal was taking place, have added to their distress and undermined their confidence in the criminal justice system. ""From customer inquiry teams to legal advisers, from court ushers to area directors, knowledge of the code and of the standard of service victims have the right to expect is alarmingly thin on the ground."" She called on the Ministry of Justice and all justice agencies ""to take a stronger lead in ensuring that, as the code is finalised, staff are aware of their responsibilities."" She added that ""a code that is not being followed is of little value"". All victims are currently offered support once they have experienced a crime, but in 80% of cases they do not take it up. The Ministry of Justice has proposed automatically offering help to those who ""most need it"", such as victims of the most serious crimes. 'Confusing and intimidating' Victim Support chief executive Javed Khan welcomed the draft Victims' Code but said the charity was ""worried that victims will fall through the cracks"". ""We hope that police and crime commissioners - with their responsibilities for victims - will want to go further than this to ensure that all victims have the support they need, when they need it,"" he said. Ms Grant insisted victims of crime need ""more help navigating a confusing and often intimidating criminal justice system"". ""Too often they tell us they feel they are treated as an after-thought or that the system made their already horrific experience worse,"" she said. She pointed out the ""total revamp"" of the code was one of her ""main priorities"" and she was very aware of the importance of ""getting this right"". ""Victims will now be able to understand and prepare themselves for their entire journey through the criminal justice system, from reporting the crime to after the trial,"" she added.

"'Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council","By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter Buckinghamshire County Council's comments came in response to a school wanting to use 11-plus results to admit a broad spread of abilities. The TES reported how Highcrest Academy was warned against using it for its admissions policy. The council claims the comments referred to who sits the exams. It said later in a statement that the ""reference to affluence was made purely in the context of factors which may influence whether parents wish their children to sit the 11-plus tests"". 'Unbelievable' It added that it had merely been pointing out that children from deprived backgrounds were more likely to be withdrawn from the test by their parents. But the letter submitted to Hillcrest Academy as part of a formal response to its consultation on its admissions policy, Buckinghamshire warned against using the test, saying: ""In the application of any test (11-plus, Cats or Sats), we know that affluence is a factor."" Buckinghamshire uses the 11-plus test to decide its secondary admissions. On its website, it says: ""There are two types of secondary schools in Buckinghamshire - upper schools and grammar schools. ""The outcome of the 11+ tests decides which type of school will best meet your child's need."" Sheena Moynihan, principal at the High Wycombe school, described the council's comments as ""unbelievable"". 'Ethnicity' She told the Times Educational Supplement: ""They acknowledge that affluence is a factor, and by implication, that ethnicity is a factor as well. And this is the test they use."" She added: ""This is what they said in their objection letter to us using the 11-plus exam for our admissions policy. ""That sentence decided it for us that we would definitely not use the 11-plus as part of our admissions."" The school had planned to use test results to select equal amounts of students from different ability bands, under what is known as a fair banding admissions system. Critics of the 11-plus and the grammar school system often claim that children with parents able to pay for private coaching are more likely to pass the tests. But this notion is rejected by supporters of grammar schools who say they give bright children the chance of a quality education.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

In April, the company announced a two-year deal with Taqa, extending engineering, construction and maintenance services to five UKCS offshore assets. In February WGPSN secured an extension to continue supporting Chevron Upstream Europe across four offshore assets in the North Sea. North Sea commitment Meanwhile, Nexen, which is controlled by CNOOC, the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation, has signalled its commitment to exploration and development in the North Sea. Production from fields including Golden Eagle and Buzzard accounted for more than 8% of the giant company's daily production during 2015, though less than 3% of its reserves. It has a 43% stake in the Buzzard oilfield, which produced an average 72,000 barrels per day last year, and a 36% interest in Golden Eagle.

Milk cuts campaign launched by Scottish farmers,"It comes after Robert Wiseman, Britain's biggest fresh milk company, said it would reduce the farm-gate milk price by 1.7p a litre from 1 August. Wiseman blamed the move on a collapse in the value of cream. After a meeting of 300 farmers at Lanark Mart, NFU Scotland said such cuts made dairy farming untenable. It called for the cuts to be reinstated and for all parts of the supply chain to commit to creating a sustainable operating environment. The union also said that the UK and Scottish governments should step in to properly regulate the industry if a fair dairy code of practice, which guaranteed farmers a realistic return from the marketplace, could not be agreed. The reduction announced by Wiseman last week followed a 2p per litre cut introduced by the East Kilbride-based firm in June. NFU Scotland's president Nigel Miller said the cuts had resulted in a ""sense of crisis"" among milk producers. He added: ""Recent price cuts have stripped millions of pounds out of dairy farmers' businesses and created anger, frustration and fear for the future. ""The situation has also created a level of unity within Scotland and the rest of the UK - between farmers and farming unions alike - to break the destructive power of discretionary pricing. ""We are at a crossroads, and our best option is to agree upon the goals which can actually lead to change. This may require legislation from Westminster or Holyrood, or both. ""To that end, today's meeting is the start of a co-ordinated campaign of action, which will also include a meeting with UK Agriculture Minister Jim Paice, and an anticipated 1,500 dairy farmers from across the UK."" Speaking after Wiseman announced last week's cut, the firm's milk procurement director Pete Nicholson said: ""We know that this news will come as a major disappointment to Wiseman Milk Group members. ""We have done everything we can to minimise the reduction in our farm-gate milk price but we must now reflect the substantially lower returns from the markets which we serve.""

"Children in care 'let down for too long', says David Cameron","Writing in the Sunday Times, the PM promised ""zero tolerance"" of state failure around social care and a new covenant for those leaving care. New laws will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when it overrides family ties, he added. Labour said government cuts had already harmed students and working families. The government will outline the plans in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday. The speech - which will mark the official state opening of Parliament - will reveal the laws the government hopes to get approved over the coming year. It is expected to include measures aimed at encouraging top UK universities to do more to improve social mobility and more help with energy costs for poorer households. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Cameron was ""keen to demonstrate that his current focus on the EU referendum was not at the expense of the domestic political agenda"". In January, Mr Cameron promised an ""all-out assault on poverty"" with a series of social reforms to include better mental health services and mentoring schemes. 'Unashamedly pro-adoption' Mr Cameron wrote that the government would legislate to encourage permanent adoption - even if it meant children were not placed with relatives. He said he was ""unashamedly pro-adoption"" and criticised courts and social workers for favouring ""less stable placements"" with distant relatives, rather than with adoption families. ""We will legislate to tip the balance in favour of permanent adoption where that is the right thing for the child - even when that means overriding family ties"", he wrote. ""For too long, whether through misguided notions of what is right or sensitivities about not wanting to cause offence, we have let the most vulnerable in our country down. That needs to change."" Reforms will also set ""new, demanding standards"" for all child and family social workers to meet by 2020, he added. A new regulator will be introduced to oversee the system, he said. Instead of ""rigid rules and processes"", social workers will be allowed to use their ""experience and common sense to make good judgements"". 'More personalised help' Mr Cameron pledged people leaving care would be given ""far more effective support"", with the introduction of the UK's first care leavers' covenant. ""This will be a promise, set out in law, to everyone who has been through the care system, making sure that local authorities set out clearly what they are entitled to locally - including housing, jobs and healthcare."" Care leavers will be given ""more personalised help"", with every person under the age of 25 given a mentor. The prime minister wrote: ""Our priorities are clear: with our economy now fundamentally stronger, I want the next four years to be a period of great social transformation in Britain."" The plans also include changes to the prisons system, new powers to tackle extremism and measures to extend educational opportunity, he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rickmansworth man Davey Everson jailed for Millie-Rose Burdett murder,"Davey Everson, 23, had been convicted of the murder of three-month-old Millie-Rose Burdett, who died in hospital on 11 January 2019. A judge at the Old Bailey said he must serve a minimum jail term of 18 years. The baby's mother, Kirsty Burdett, 25, of Rickmansworth, was convicted of causing or allowing the death of her daughter and was jailed for six years. At a sentencing hearing, the court heard how Everson was said to have ""used inappropriate and excessive force"" during the baby's short life and had become ""riled"" that the child had begun to look like her biological father. During the pair's trial at St Albans Crown Court, the jury heard Millie-Rose was admitted to Watford General Hospital on 15 December 2018 with multiple fractures, bruising and a bleed on the brain, from which she never recovered. She later died in a coma at King's College Hospital in London. The jury heard Everson, who lived in Haselbury Road, in Edmonton, London, had begun a relationship with Burdett, of Nightingale Road, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, when she was pregnant. He was alone with the baby when the fatal injuries were inflicted, but told emergency services she choked and stopped breathing while he was feeding her. Prosecutors said the brain injury suggested a ""strong possibility of a non-accidental injury having taken place"" and it was likely Everson injured her by ""shaking or throwing her against a surface"". The baby was later found to have suffered 12 fractured ribs and two leg fractures before the fatal assault took place. The jury also heard Burdett ""failed to take reasonable steps to protect Millie"" and ""covered up for [Everson]"". Passing sentence, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a ""sustained assault on a small baby"" and, referring to the existing injuries, said Everson had ""caused her acute and lasting pain for half of her short life"". ""One of the things that upset you, Everson, was that Millie-Rose was beginning to resemble her biological father, and that riled you,"" she said. Everson and Burdett were also given four and two-month jail sentences, respectively, for cruelty to a person under 16, involving another child who cannot be named.

Coronavirus: Lockdown 'could boost wild flowers',"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Plantlife has been urging councils for years to cut grass less often. It also wants them to delay cutting until flowers have had chance to seed. The charity says it has seen a shift in attitudes in recent years, but some councillors still say their citizens prefer neatly-manicured lawns and verges. Now Plantlifeâs preliminary research suggests that municipal mowing has been among the first activities to be cut under the crisis. Thatâs partly because staff are sick or self-isolating, and partly to save money as budgets are squeezed. Plantlifeâs Trevor Dines told BBC News that an upsurge in public support for wild flower verges had already persuaded some authorities to restrict cutting. Emptying bins He said that a search of local authority websites and social media suggested that more councils are now being jolted into a policy change so they can re-deploy ground staff to services such as emptying bins. He said: âWe have seen an upsurge in members of the public complaining that their councils are cutting the daisies. These sort of comments used to be outweighed by people complaining about untidy grass verges, but it seems as though the balance has shifted. âObviously weâre extremely worried about the Covid crisis and want it to end as quickly as possible. But if councils do change their methods because of the crisis, they might find it wins public support, which would be good for the future.â Among the councils registering changes due to the Covid crisis are: Plantlife wants councils to delay cutting until the end of August or the start of September until after plants have seeded. Meanwhile, the reduction of traffic during the Covid-19 crisis will produce another benefit for wild flowers. Typically, roadside verges are drenched with nitrogen emissions from vehicle exhausts. This fertilises the hardier species in the plant world, which can harness the nitrogen to grow and out-compete more delicate wild flowers.

Newspaper headlines: 'Midsummer's dream' and '118 days until freedom',"By BBC NewsStaff ""Four steps to freedom,"" the i declares; ""118 days until freedom"" is the the Daily Telegraph's headline, while the Daily Express echoes the prime minister's words, speaking of a ""one-way road to freedom"". It's a ""midsummer dream"" the Metro concludes, but notes that ""solstice day"" is only ""pencilled in"" for the end of all lockdowns. The Guardian calls it a ""cautious, phased easing of curbs""; the Daily Star ""a vaguely sensible road map""; while the Financial Times welcomes it as a ""balanced approach"". But the Sun insists that the ""go-slow"" end to restrictions offers an ""agonising wait."" And the Daily Mail demands ""what are we waiting for?"", saying that Mr Johnson faces a ""clamour to lift the lockdown faster."" Concerns are raised about the plan to return all pupils to school in England at once. A head teacher tells the Daily Mirror that going ""to full classes... will not be easy."" An anonymous teacher writing in the i fears that teachers will be ""walking targets"" for Covid-19. In the Guardian, teaching unions call the proposal ""madness"" which risks ""increasing the rate of infection."" But the Labour former Education Secretary, David Blunkett, insists in the Mail that it would be a ""betrayal"" of teachers and children if unions prevented a return to classes. The Financial Times suggests secondary schools may not go back in full until the third week of March. Both the Express and the Mirror report that the taxpayer will be footing the bill for the redundancy payouts to staff at Arcadia. The GMB union tells the Express it is ""absolutely scandalous"" that the retail group's chairman, Sir Philip Green ""sails off on his yacht"" while workers apply for redundancy through the statutory process. The Mirror calls it ""another reason to strip him of his knighthood.""

Merseyside Police arrest footage reveals 'nothing short of an assault',"The video appears to show Nathan De Asha, owner of the Prophecy Performance Centre gym in Liverpool, being kicked while held for alleged Covid breaches. Vinny Tomlinson told the BBC it was, in his view, ""nothing short of assault"". Merseyside Police said the use of force in the arrest had been ""necessary"". The footage, believed to have been captured by the Speke gym's own CCTV system, appears to show Mr De Asha being arrested during a raid on Sunday, when police found more than 50 people inside. Mr De Asha, who told a closure order hearing at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Wednesday that he and other gym members were ""manhandled, mauled and abused"" by police, has been approached for comment. 'Angry, sickened and disgusted' Mr Tomlinson, who resigned as chairman of the force's Black Police Officers' Association in 2010, said the ""brutality and the unnecessary use of force"" had ""absolutely sickened me and I know that it sickened others in the community, both black and white"". ""The gentleman in question was handcuffed to the rear [and] posed no threat,"" he added. ""Officers have to use reasonable force [and] it should be as a last resort... a kick to the guy's stomach was totally unnecessary. ""It's nothing short of an assault."" He said it was ""just another example of a black man being brutalised while in the custody of the police"", and had left people ""angry, sickened and disgusted"". Mr Tomlinson added that he wanted to see Merseyside Police ""accept that what actually took place was not acceptable"". ""They're forever talking to the black community, trying to reassure us and then we go and see this,"" he said. ""For the force to not acknowledge it, when we can all see what took place, it undermines what little trust and confidence there is."" Merseyside Police's Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said her officers were given ""extensive training"" around the ""importance of using force lawfully and proportionately"". ""The decision to use force is never taken lightly, and in cases where it is appropriate, officers must often make quick, split-second judgements where there is a risk of harm,"" she added. ""During this incident, the use of force was judged necessary by officers in response to people's behaviour. ""Officers should not be confronted with abuse and violence when attempting to uphold the law which most people are rightly abiding by.""

Bangor: Pontio Yma ac Acw (Here and There) celebration,"People have swapped stories for Pontio Yma ac Acw (Here and There) which celebrates the Gwynedd city's different ethnic communities. It is based on the theme of When We Were Young and about 150 children and adults have taken part. The project opens on Monday at Pontio's shop on High Street in Bangor. Author Angharad Tomos and the young people's laureate for Wales Martin Daws have been involved, along with locals and those who have moved to the city from abroad or other parts of the UK. Local community artists were also used to find ways of using different art forms to explore some of the stories, through creative writing, poetry, music, song and visual art. Project leader Pauline Down said: ""It is a community arts project that has been bringing together primary school children, older Bangor residents and those from other areas who have moved to the city, including people originally from Bolivia, China, Bangladesh and Iraq. ""They've been exchanging stories based on a theme of When We Were Young and about 90 children took part and more than 50 adults. ""One story recounts a woman's childhood living in a mining family in Bolivia and she explains how in the evening they would watch condors. ""In another story, a Bangor woman recalls her life as a child buying scraps of cake and sweets. She remembers a World War II Italian prisoner of war camp on Bangor beach and how the girls were pleased when American soldiers came to the area. ""She went onto to say that after the war homes were destroyed in Hirael (in Bangor) and were replaced by flats and how they looked liked prisons. ""This inspired some children to write a rap poem called Life about the good and bad in people's lives."" Pontio arts development officer Dyfan Roberts said Bangor had a wealth of different communities and stories to tell. ""This exhibition celebrates the creative work that has come out of this inter-generational and inter-cultural exchange,"" he said. Pontio has been working in the community, and organising events at a number of venues in Bangor as work progresses to develop a new Â£44m arts and innovation centre in the city. In January, the foundation stone was laid for the project - also called Pontio - which will house a new theatre, cinema, restaurant, bars, student union and teaching and learning spaces. The Bangor University-led centre, which will be open to the community, is likely to be ready by 2014.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn adapt Raymond Briggs book for BBC,"The film will tell the autobiographical story of the couple's life through four decades of marriage from the late 1920s to the early 1970s. Broadbent and Blethyn will be joined by Luke Treadaway, Virginia McKenna and June Brown. It will be shown on the BBC next year. Ethel and Ernest was one of Briggs' best-selling books, alongside The Snowman and When The Wind Blows. In response to news of the film adaptation he remarked: ""My mother's reaction would no doubt have been: 'Oh, Ernest! We're going to be on the pictures! We might even be at the Odeon in Wimbledon!'"" ""It's truly inspiring"" Broadbent, an Oscar-winner for Iris and Blethyn, an Oscar nominee for Secrets and Lies, will be joined behind the microphone by Luke Treadaway, voicing the part of Briggs. Treadaway has won plaudits for his performance on stage in The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. Broadbent remarked: ""It's such a beautiful book by a wonderful artist. It's truly inspiring; a great, honest story of a whole generation. It's lovely and irresistible."" Brenda Blethyn added: ""I adore working with Jim Broadbent. We've worked together before and it's great to come back together to play these wonderful characters. They lived through two wars and it's so, so reminiscent of my own parents' life in so many ways.

Scot back in police custody in India over fresh claims,"Jagtar Singh Johal, 30, has been in custody for a fortnight. He appeared in court early on Friday and was sent to prison until 30 November. However, he was returned to court to face new allegations over the death of a Christian priest in 2015. He has not been charged with any crime and his lawyer claims his client has been tortured by police. Indian police have accused Mr Johal of financing the purchase of weapons used to kill Hindu leaders, but his lawyer said he is now accused of involvement in the death of a priest in Ludhiana in July 2015. Mr Johal was taken from a street in the Indian state on 4 November. His family say he was there on holiday having married in the region in October. Appearing earlier on Friday, Mr Johal was presented at a lower court in Bagha Purana, Moga. He entered the court room flanked by half a dozen Punjabi officers. Prosecutors did not ask for Mr Johal's police custody to be extended. During the brief hearing, he was transferred from police to judicial custody after the judge questioned the prosecution about claims the accused was tortured. A British High Commission official was also in court and met with the accused. The court also allowed Mr Johal's mother-in-law and father-in-law to meet him briefly. 'Concerns of torture' Campaigners have called for the immediate intervention of the British Foreign Office in the case. On Thursday about 400 British Sikhs demonstrated outside the Foreign Office in London demanding more be done to help him. The Sikh Federation said it feared Mr Johal was being targeted over his work highlighting the Sikh genocide in 1984. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our consular staff in New Delhi have visited a British man who has been detained in Punjab. We have met his family to update them, and have confirmed that he now has access to his lawyer."" On allegations of torture, the spokesman added: ""We take all allegations or concerns of torture and mistreatment very seriously and will follow up with action as appropriate. ""When considering how to act, we will avoid any action that might put the individual in question or any other person that may be affected at risk.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stonehaven evacuation amid flooding fears,"Heavy rain along with rough sea conditions flooded parts of the beach area. Elsewhere, an elderly man had to be rescued from rising waters at the River North Esk by a helicopter. A number of flood warnings and weather alerts were issued as Scotland continues to be hit by severe weather. Police said about nine people had moved from ground floor flats at the Turners Court sheltered housing complex in Stonehaven. Sand bags have been deployed, and people warned to stay away from the harbour and beach area. The 70-year-old man had to be rescued from the river near Glenesk when he got into difficulty amid rising water while fishing. Police, the fire service and an ambulance crew were called to the scene a mile upriver from Gannochy at about 12:45, and a helicopter was brought in to winch the man to safety.

South Africa funeral firm to sue pastor for 'resurrection stunt',"A viral video of Pastor Alph Lukau shows him shouting ""rise up"" to a man lying down in a coffin who then jerks upright to cheers from worshippers. The funeral companies say they were manipulated into being involved. The spectacle, seen outside Pastor Lukau's church near Johannesburg, has been ridiculed and condemned by many. ""There are no such things as miracles,"" the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) told South Africa's national broadcaster. ""They are made up to try to get money from the hopelessness of our people."" 'Tricked' three companies Three funeral companies who say they were manipulated by the ""scheme"" are now taking legal action for damage to their reputation. Kingdom Blue, Kings & Queens Funeral Services and Black Phoenix told local media that church representatives tricked them in different ways. ""Alleged family members of the deceased"" told the Kings & Queens Funeral Services they had had a ""dispute with a different funeral service provider"". The customers also allegedly placed ""Black Phoenix stickers on their private car"" to look credible to Kings & Queens Funeral Services when they went to hire a hearse from them. National debate The coffin, the funeral directors say, was acquired from Kingdom Blue. Pastor Lukau's church, Alleluia Ministries International, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The Sowetan news site reports that the church has since backtracked on its resurrection claim, saying the ""dead"" man was in fact ""already alive"" when he was brought to the premises in Kramerville. Pastor Lukau had only ""completed a miracle that God had already started"", Alleluia International Ministries is quoted by The Sowetan as saying. The BBC's Milton Nkosi says the video has sparked a national debate on fake pastors and had been widely condemned by established religious groups. However some South Africans have taken to social media with the hashtag #ResurrectionChallenge to see the funny side. It is the latest high-profile row over religious leaders in the country who make extraordinary claims to their congregations. Last year, a South African pastor was found guilty of assault for spraying his followers with a household insecticide which he falsely claimed could heal cancer and HIV.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Prince William tours disaster-hit NZ and Australia,"He met rescue workers in Christchurch, where more than 160 people died in the earthquake. The prince is starting a tour of disaster zones in New Zealand and Australia on behalf of the Queen. Prince William is also visiting the scene of a mining explosion that killed 29 people in November, before going on to flood-hit areas of Australia. The prince was greeted at Christchurch's emergency management centre by the minister for earthquake recovery Gerry Brownlee, and Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker. 'Unbelievable' He went on to see the city's badly damaged cathedral, where the tower collapsed in the quake. ""The scale of it is unbelievable,"" he said as he toured the centre of Christchurch to inspect the damage. He met and joked with emergency workers and fire crews. Search and rescue technician Martin Sparrow said the visit had boosted morale: ""It shows that what has happened here is in the eye of the world."" Terry Gyde, a firefighter who met Prince William at the city fire station, said: ""He was pretty awe-inspired I think, it was quite surreal to be there and for anyone listening to it it becomes a bit overwhelming at times."" He added: ""We are from the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth countries always stick together."" The Prince, who is making the trip without his fiancÃ©e Kate Middleton, is due to attend a memorial service in the city on Friday for victims of the quake. Solidarity Speaking earlier this month, a St James's Palace spokesman said the visit had been arranged following invitations from the prime ministers of New Zealand and Australia. The spokesman added: ""The Royal Family have been watching the natural disasters with the same shock and sadness as everyone else. ""They wanted to show their solidarity with the people of New Zealand and Australia, and the decision was taken with the prime ministers' offices and the royal household that Prince William should attend and visit the countries."" The magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck the city of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island on 22 February this year. Prince William travelled on to Greymouth to meet the families of the 29 victims of the Pike River mine disaster. Also on the South Island, the miners became trapped by a gas explosion at the Pike River coal mine in Atarau on 19 November last year. In Australia, he will go to several locations in Queensland over two days followed by a visit to north-west Victoria. Parts of the country were affected by torrential rains starting in November last year, forcing rivers to burst their banks. Prince William was last in New Zealand in January 2010, when he represented the Queen in Auckland and Wellington. He made a private visit to Sydney and Melbourne in Australia the same month. He first visited Australia as a baby on his parents' tour in 1983.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gloucestershire unitary authority plans 'nuts',"The idea is for Tewkesbury, Cheltenham and the Cotswolds to form one council and Gloucester, Stroud and the Forest of Dean to form the other. Leaders from three of the district councils have agreed to start exploring the proposal. The idea has been described as ""nuts"" by the leader of the county council. The plan has been suggested ahead of the expected release of a White Paper in the autumn that is expected to call for more unitary councils, combined authorities and mayors in the UK. In a joint statement the leaders of Cheltenham Borough Council, Cotswold District Council, and Stroud District Council, said: ""We expect the government to confirm that if Gloucestershire is to unlock significant future investment, we must accept reorganisation. ""While strong arguments may be put forward for having a large, single unitary council, we believe that an innovative and progressive two council devolution deal should be explored as well to get the best for Gloucestershire."" They said two unitary authorities would be ""efficient"" and ""represent our unique urban and rural communities"". 'Makes no sense' However, the Conservative leader of Gloucestershire County Council, Mark Hawthorne, said having two unitary councils ""would be nuts"". He said it would lead to council tax hikes to pay for duplicating services, disrupt alignment with NHS, fire and Local Enterprise Partnership services, and lead to ""weirdly shaped council areas that make no sense to anyone"". Jeremy Hilton, leader of the Liberal Democrats on Gloucester City Council, said ""trying to carve up Gloucestershire"" was ""reckless"". ""The city has had a council for 500 years and it needs to have a dedicated council. ""Splitting it down an east-west split would be damaging for the future of local government."" Analysis Hayley Mortimer, BBC Gloucestershire political reporter The two-tier system of county and district councils has been in place for nearly half a century but has come under pressure due to smaller budgets and rising demands. There is broad agreement that reorganisation could help when it comes to sharing services and saving money. But some politicians say that a single unitary authority would be bad news for taxpayers, because it wouldn't represent those who live in the far corners of the county. Instead, they are suggesting merging Gloucestershire's seven councils into two bodies, essentially splitting the county in half. But there's no consensus on where the boundary would be. The Lib Dems in Cheltenham and the Cotswolds are working with the Labour group in Stroud on the idea of an east-west split. But politicians in Gloucester don't like this and want the city to have more powers - perhaps a Greater Gloucester unitary authority with the rest of the county forming another. And as the biggest authority, the county council will be key in any decision made.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russians fly orphan bear to new life,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Villagers in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula found the starving 10-month-old roaming their freezing streets last month, crying out for food and help. When local volunteers managed to coax her into a shelter, they found she was half the 50 kg (110 lbs) a bear of her age should normally weigh, Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reports. The villagers of Malka fed the cub on fish and named her Mashka, then set about finding her a new home - once local trackers had established that her mother was dead. But this proved easier said than done. The local zoo in Yelizovo was only able to offer Mashka temporary accommodation, as they lack the room for another rapidly-growing Kamchatka brown bear - the largest sub-species in Eurasia. Mashka on Facebook Nature reserves also had to decline, as a cub accustomed to people would be vulnerable to predators, and Mashka lost her mother before she could learn to catch fish herself, the paper reports. But Mashka's rescuers struck lucky with the Feniks Animal Rehabilitation Centre in Kaluga, in the west of the country. But flying even a small bear from one end of Russia to the other costs serious money, so Veronika Matyushina, the director of the Feniks Centre, set Mashka up with a Facebook account to use the power of social media to foot the 220,000-rouble (Â£2,560; $3,288) bill. You might also be interested in: The story captured the popular imagination, with TV channels, tabloids and even the staid official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta taking up Mashka's cause, so the campaign quickly reached its target. ""Hello! My ticket for the silver-winged plane is all ready. Thank you all for helping me get to the Feniks Centre,"" Mashka's account said, adding that she is due to arrive at her new home on 22 January. Bears are much-loved in Russian culture, and the media coverage of the story has certainly played on the appealing nature of the bear cub, but the Feniks Centre emphasises that this is ""no cartoon bear - this is a serious animal"". ""We are aware of the great responsibility we are taking on, and will do all we can to care for her and guarantee her safety and the safety of others, as we prepare Mashka for her life among people,"" Ms Matyushina posted on Facebook. She also made the point that the more poachers kill adult bears, the more lost and hungry cubs will wander into towns in search of food. This winter has seen a number of bear attacks in Kamchatka, to the point where local prosecutors have demanded action from the authorities to protect the public. Komsomolskaya Pravda summed up the popular mood over Mashka when it said ""inhuman people left her to die, but decent people sent in their pennies to save her from starving"".

Are farmers getting the mental health support they need?,"By Elaine MitchellBBC News NI But a charity which helps farmers and rural families in Northern Ireland says there's been a 25% increase in the number of farmers calling them for help in the past year. Rural Support's chief executive, Jude McCann, told the BBC the most common reason for calls was financial worries. He was speaking at the Farmers Health Conference, in Cookstown, County Tyrone, on Thursday. Health organisations and government groups came together to discuss the problems facing farmers. Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill has blamed falling farm gate prices for some of the stress farmers face. 'Challenging year' She says: ""People are at the end of their tether. ""There is no doubt about it, this has been such a financially challenging year. ""The prices they're receiving are putting farmers out of business and the impact on them is obvious. I am engaging with farmers who aren't sleeping because of the worry and the stress they are under. It's just so important that we have this conversation."" The conference brought together people from across the agri-health sector to try and improve the support services currently on offer. Community mental health worker, Mellissa Andrews, told delegates a more tailored support is needed to reach out to farmers. ""Not everyone is comfortable going to a meditation class, or yoga or even a computer class - that's not the farmers' way,"" she says. ""The best thing to do would be to get out there into their communities; the local shows and vintage rallies and meet them on their own level."" Trigger points Cormac McKervey is agri-manager at the Ulster Bank and deals with farmers everyday. He says that although the bank has to focus on the financial side of things, they need to be aware of what support services are out there too. ""There's all the social issues and the impact on the family inside the farm door, which we don't have access to. ""The biggest single thing we can do is to make our staff aware of the issues and the trigger points, to be aware that maybe this farmer needs more than purely financial help. ""If we can signpost them to rural support or other agencies that are trying to help them then hopefully we've done something.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Extra testing in Pendle to stop virus spread,"The area in east Lancashire was second highest for new cases in England last week, according to public health stats. ""There is a cause for concern and we need to continue to be careful,"" said David Whipp, council deputy leader. But he said a local lockdown or extra restrictions like Blackburn with Darwen could be avoided if ""we get people acting sensibly"". ""The overall numbers and the consistency of the level of transmission is much lower in Pendle and much lower than in Leicester, for instance, so that's one of the reasons why we don't need to go as far,"" he said. In the Public Health England report based on the week to 11 July, Pendle was second for new cases with the equivalent of 76.6 per 100,000 population, up from 14.2 per 100,000. It was significantly behind Leicester, which has had a local lockdown imposed, at 120.2 per 100,000. A taskforce has been set up by Pendle Council to help curb the rise in cases. Other steps being taken include working with local shops and other businesses to make sure they are ""Covid-19 secure"" and communicating with community leaders to help get safety messages across. Mr Whipp said the council had already employed an extra environmental health officer and had demanded ""better"" and ""more timely"" data from the government. ""The data we are working on is inadequate and flawed; it isn't detailed enough,"" he said. ""We would really like to be able to get down to street level data where we could identify where the problems are. ""Then all our efforts can be targeted in the right areas with the right people in order to contain the disease and prevent it spreading any further."" He said he wanted to expand testing into community venues such as gyms and mosques to ""target the people most likely to be transmitting the disease"". Nelson Central Mosque is already taking measures in addition to social distancing. ""We make sure we sign people in and make sure they sanitise their hands before they enter the mosque and take their temperature,"" volunteer Faraz Ahmad said. He said worshippers are signed in ""so if there are any signs of Covid we can trace them a lot easier"". Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health for Lancashire, said it was important ""to work together to keep our communities safe"". ""With the slight increase in the Covid-19 infection rate in Pendle, it's really important to stay alert to the risks,"" he said. The new weekly PHE figures will be published on Friday.

Norman Baker: EU would slow down 'legal highs' fight,"By Justin ParkinsonPolitical reporter, BBC News The Liberal Democrat told a parliamentary committee the UK was already in a ""stronger position"" than most states, as it had flexibility to act act quickly. The coalition has banned more than 200 substances since coming to power. New arrivals still pose ""quite a challenge"", Mr Baker said. Legal highs - officially known as psychoactive substances - are synthetic drugs which can be bought online and sometimes in shops. They are often created in laboratories in the Far East and are are rushed to European and other markets before authorities have time to ban them. 'Diversity' Several deaths have been linked to legal highs in recent months. In June, two of them, known as NBOMe and Benzo Fury, were made illegal in the UK. Mr Baker, MP for Lewes, became a Home Office minister in David Cameron's government reshuffle last week and his responsibilities include crime prevention and drugs policy. He was questioned by the House of Lords EU Sub-Committee, which is looking at whether Brussels should have powers to impose bans on ""legal highs"". It has until mid-November to make suggestions to the EU as to whether this exceeds its responsibilities. Mr Baker, who is among the most pro-European MPs in the Commons, said the substances ""should be dealt with by the member states, by and large"". 'More dangerous' He said: ""It's clear that the number and diversity of of these psychoactive substances has changed in recent years. ""It's quite a challenge to respond to what are often dangerous substances. They have the unhelpful terminology of 'legal highs'... implying to the public that they are safe, as they are legal. ""In some cases the so-called legal highs are more dangerous than controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971."" The minister doubted whether ceding further powers to the EU would be helpful, adding: ""Here in the UK we are in a better situation than many other countries."" Parliament had ""early warning legislation"" in place, which meant there were generic definitions of banned substances so that ""entire families of drugs"" could be made illegal, he said. This ensured that ""some substances can be created that are already counted under the definition"", putting the UK ""ahead of the curve"". Mr Baker said that because of the UK's laws, about 80% of legal highs entering the country were ""already illegal"", adding that it was imperative to make the time taken to ban legal highs ""as short as possible."" He said: ""The new proposals open up the potential for some disputes between the EU and member states, which is not helpful. ""There's an issue as to whether or not the EU-wide decision-making promising to supplant the national arrangements is a sensible idea, if it takes away member states' jurisdiction. I say that as a Liberal Democrat.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
British Legion calls for more research into Gulf War illnesses,"Over 33,000 former soldiers are thought to suffer from illnesses related to their service such as chronic headaches, fatigue and memory problems. The charity said too little was known about the condition and the government should fund more research into it. The Ministry of Defence said it was always open to new research proposals. Reported symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome range from chronic fatigue, headaches and sleep disturbances to joint pains, irritable bowel, stomach and respiratory disorders and psychological problems. But the MoD says ""the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community"" is that the range of symptoms is too broad ""for this ill health to be characterised as a syndrome in medical terms"". 'Important area' In 1991 more than 50,000 members of the British armed forces were deployed in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Storm - a US-led campaign against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The British Legion - which provides support for veterans - said more than 60% were now suffering from illnesses related to the conflict, with nearly 10,000 receiving a war pension, the financial aid any ex-service personnel with an illness due to service can receive. Marie Louise Sharp, policy adviser at the Legion, said that 25 years on, more needed to be done to help ill soldiers. ""We know the health of ill Gulf War veterans continues to be an important area for the government, which is why the Legion is calling for investment into research so we can understand how to improve the lives of those affected,"" she said. ""In addition, we ask for formal communication channels to be established to convey the results of US research developments to Gulf War veterans living here in the UK."" Gulf War Syndrome The charity said research into appropriate treatment and health pathways would significantly improve their lives but that there had never been any published research in the UK into treatment or best practice. There is still disagreement over why rates of ill health are twice as high among Gulf War veterans than troops deployed elsewhere, and campaigners and doctors continue to disagree over whether the syndrome actually exists as a medical condition unique to Operation Desert Storm. In its 2015 manifesto the Legion said the first phase of an MoD-commissioned study at Cardiff University, which examined potential interventions to rehabilitate ill Gulf War veterans, had started in January 2009 but ""for reasons unknown to us, the MoD chose not to fund the second phase of research, and the results of phase one were never published"". The MoD said it was always open to new research proposals, but added that the war pension scheme was part of its absolute commitment to the armed forces.

Dale Farm eviction: 'Show of force designed to shock',"By Julian SturdyBBC East The police, the travellers were told, would only be there to maintain the peace and prevent criminality. But when they struck, the eviction operation was sudden and unexpected. This was a police operation to break the siege of Dale Farm. They came in at first light, across a farmer's field, outflanking protesters who had chained themselves to the main gate. And within minutes, seven weeks of defensive preparations proved futile. Tasers had been deployed, and more than 100 riot police had breached the barricades. It was an impressive show of force, designed to shock the travellers and supporters. First the perimeter fences, then plot by plot at a running pace, the police marched on to their goal - seizing control of the main gate. 'Bricks were flying' Anyone who stood in their way was knocked aside with riot shields. I saw batons being used, and snatch squads pulling out the ring leaders. This was not gratuitous violence. Just an imposition of control in a chaotic moment. Bottles, bricks and sticks were flying - thrown by protesters and travellers alike. Past Camp Constant, the headquarters of the protesters, they ran. A few plots were supposed to be off limits - travellers who lived there legally were safe from the bailiffs. But the police, from the Met, and even South Wales, broke through fences, kicked down protected walls, and entered the legal Dale Farm compound. Some travellers did stand in their way. Nellie Sheridan was pulled from the ruck and dumped on the hard core. In tears, she complained of back pain and was later taken to hospital. Hours later, she was re-admitted on a stretcher, with a suspected back injury. Caravan alight Another resident, Margaret Sheridan, showed me grazes on her face. She said she had been pushed over by the police. Others vented their fury by setting light to a redundant caravan. It burned fiercely below a high voltage power line. Later a second trailer was pulled into the road and it too was torched. And it all happened just feet away from where we had camped the night before. A night which had been spent around the camp fire with the travellers as they savoured their last few hours of calm. They knew the end was coming. They had had 10 years of clinging to the cliff, fighting off legal challenges. Finally their luck ran out. But there will still be travellers at Dale Farm camp. Half the site is legitimate and even within the illegal camp, five plots are safe. Tonight travellers still sleep on camp. The cat and mouse game with the council will carry on. For some Â£20m, the residents of Basildon have seen planning anarchy prevented. There is talk still of European law, of siting vans on vacant plots once the council bailiffs have gone. The story of Dale Farm is not over yet.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Venezuela ex-prosecutor: I have proof of Maduro corruption,"Luisa Ortega also accused two party leaders and the new prosecutor. Ms Ortega, who fled Venezuela last week after she was sacked and her husband charged with extortion, says her life is still in danger. She faces charges of misconduct, amid allegations she ignored corruption cases sent to her while in office. The ex-prosecutor's latest comments came at a press conference in the Brazilian capital, where she alleged that President Maduro had been involved in a bribery scheme centred on the Brazilian construction giant, Odebrecht. ""I want to denounce, in front of the world, a grave situation in Venezuela: that of excessive corruption,"" Ms Ortega said. ""I have a lot of proof, concretely in the Odebrecht case, which implicates many high-ranking Venezuelans, starting with the president of the republic."" She implicated the vice-president of the governing PSUV party, Diosdado Cabello, and influential party member Jorge RodrÃ­guez in the Odebrecht case. She also accused the new Venezuelan prosecutor, Tarek Saab, of corruption related to the country's state oil company, PDVSA. But Mr Saab has dismissed her allegations, saying: ""There is no validity in what an ex-prosecutor can say after ten years of inaction against any of the people she is talking about now."" There has been no response yet from Odebrecht, which has been at the centre of a huge investigation in Brazil over kickbacks for contracts. The investigation has led to prosecutions in several countries in Latin America where Odebrecht and other Brazilian construction companies operated. On Tuesday, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said he would request an international arrest warrant against Ms Ortega and her husband, former loyalist congressman GermÃ¡n Ferrer. Mr Maduro said both were working with the United States against his government and had committed serious crimes. Venezuela's controversial new constituent assembly sacked her for misconduct, with President Maduro saying she had ignored corruption cases sent to her by the government. Mr Ferrer is accused of extortion and corruption allegedly happening within the office of the chief prosecutor. Ms Ortega has said she fears for her life and wants to hand over the documents she is carrying to other countries so they can investigate her allegations. ""The most serious thing,"" she said, ""is that everything is connected to corruption. Everything that has happened to me is because of a series of allegations I have made."" Officials in Colombia who offered her asylum and protection have suggested that Ms Ortega and her husband will seek asylum in the United States. Why is Venezuela in crisis?

Tesla's Elon Musk may be in contempt over tweet,"His comments came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the courts to hold him in contempt for violating a settlement aimed at limiting his social media comments. The rule was imposed after he upset markets in August with tweets about taking Tesla private. The judge has given Mr Musk until 11 March to formally respond. However, Mr Musk has already defended himself on Twitter. He argued that the offending tweet, a prediction of the electric car firm's production rate, replicated comments he had already made on a call with financial analysts. ""SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing ..."" he wrote. ""Something is broken with SEC oversight,"" he added later. How did the tweet controversy begin? Last year, Mr Musk agreed that he would not make statements about Tesla's financial performance without prior agreement with the company. The rule was part of a settlement reached after the SEC accused Mr Musk of misleading investors with a tweet in August that claimed he had secured funding to take the firm private. US authorities also ordered Tesla and Mr Musk to pay a $20m (Â£15.2m) fine and forced Mr Musk to relinquish his role as chairman for three years. In court papers filed in New York on Monday, the SEC said Mr Musk did not follow the Twitter protocol agreed to in the settlement. It pointed to his Twitter activity last week, in which he posted an aerial picture of thousands of new Tesla vehicles, and followed that by saying he expected the firm to make 500,000 cars in 2019. Mr Musk later clarified the tweet, saying he ""meant to say"" that he was referring to an annualized production rate - not overall deliveries. However, the SEC said the tweet was inaccurate and in breach of Mr Musk's agreement, noting that it was disseminated to more than 24 million people. ""Musk has thus violated the Court's Final Judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the Final Judgment was designed to prevent,"" the SEC wrote in its motion filed on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. Erratic behaviour The filing prompted a sell-off in Tesla shares in after-hours trading. But the price rebounded on Tuesday. The exchange renewed questions over Mr Musk's judgment, which attracted scrutiny last summer after a spate of erratic behaviour. Mr Musk has remained defiant, despite the SEC penalty and investor calls for stronger oversight. In an earlier interview with news channel CBS, he said that he had ""no respect"" for the SEC, but he had chosen to pay the settlement fine because he believed in the justice system.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dundee University to tackle hepatitis in Tayside drug users,"Working alongside NHS Tayside, researchers hope to reduce the number of hepatitis C infections by targeting drug users at an early stage. Hepatitis C is a virus predominantly affecting the liver and is easily spread through contact with blood. Funding has come from the Scottish government and drug companies. The project aims to bring down the rates of hepatitis C among the Tayside population where it has been a significant and entrenched problem, which in turn should have an impact on public health and costs to the NHS. Future savings The university team hopes that by giving early treatment to small numbers of people who inject drugs and are infected with the virus, it will prevent the need to treat larger numbers later. In turn this would help reduce instances of liver cirrhosis and cancer, which can develop over time if hepatitis C is not treated. The Â£2.2m funding has come from the Scottish government and drug companies Janssen and Roche. Project leader Dr John Dillon, a clinical senior lecturer and consultant hepatologist, said: ""Hepatitis C is a disease which consumes a significant amount of resource in the NHS. ""The general thinking in recent times has been that the population of people who inject drugs is generally too unstable and consists of people with lives which are too chaotic to allow for the sort of sustained treatment that hepatitis C needs to achieve a cure. ""However, our view is that with the right approach, supported with appropriate resources, we can tackle what is a very significant problem and reduce the rates of hepatitis C infection."" National interest Minister for Public Health Michael Matheson said: ""This project demonstrates our commitment to invest in new approaches and efforts to tackle the disease. ""The work being carried out by the clinicians and academics in Dundee will undoubtedly be of international interest, and could significantly change the way we respond to the disease."" Hepatitis C has been a particular problem among people who inject drugs as it can be easily spread through contact with blood, so shared drug paraphernalia such as needles present a significant risk. Dr Dillon and colleagues hope to recruit 100 patients with hepatitis C over the next five years. They will be enrolled in a programme of treatment delivered through existing frontline specialist services. Ann Eriksen, NHS Tayside's executive lead for sexual health and blood-borne virus, said: ""The clinical trial offers for the first time the real prospect of radically reducing the prevalence of hepatitis C in the population most at risk. ""The fact that this has come to Tayside is testament to Scotland's success in tackling hepatitis C as a country and in particular to the farsightedness, innovation, skill and care of the clinical team and partner agencies.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cambridgeshire guided busway opens to passengers,"Buses will run between Huntingdon in the north of the county and Trumpington, just south of Cambridge. The route, which includes 13.3 miles (21.5km) of guided concrete track, is believed to be the longest in the world. It is hoped the busway will ease congestion on the A14 and provide an alternative mode of transport for people living at a proposed new housing development in the area. However, the Â£116.2m busway has not been the quickest, or easiest, of projects to deliver. It was expected to open in spring 2009, but has been beset by delays and financial disputes between Cambridgeshire County Council and its original contractor BAM Nuttall Ltd. In 2001, funding from the Department for Transport was granted for the development of the concrete-tracked busway along a disused railway track between St Ives and Cambridge. A public consultation was carried out in 2003 to gauge reaction to the proposals. The plans were approved and funding was awarded to the council in 2006 who contracted BAM Nuttall Ltd to carry out the work. Martin Bentley from the MG Owners' Club at Swavesey, which lies on the route, tried the bus ahead of the opening date and said the busway could be good for his business. ""We're no longer a backwater village location,"" he said. ""We're right on the main line so we're going to be very exposed to a lot of people who didn't know about us."" However, Marian Cleaver, a parish councillor for Histon, said that although the busway was ""very fast and smooth"", she was unlikely to use it to travel into the city. ""It's quite difficult to get to the pick-up points and there isn't parking at Impington or Histon. There are quicker ways of getting into Cambridge,"" she said. CAST.IRON, the Cambridge and St Ives Railway Organisation, campaigned against the busway. They wanted the railway line reopened instead. A statement on their website said the group remained ""utterly unconvinced"" that the busway scheme would ""make any noticeable difference to traffic levels on the A14 and there is no doubt it will increase congestion in the city's streets"". Bob Menzies, head of busway delivery at the council, said that although buses would be travelling on roads for some of the route, the guided tracks would significantly speed up some journeys. ""When [the bus] gets to the busway, that's when it's very quick. St Ives to the Science Park in just 20 minutes and that's always been the key,"" he said. The chief executive of BAM Nuttall Ltd, Stephen Fox, said: ""We are delighted to see [the busway] opening to the public and look forward to its successful operation in the future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The heartbreak of watching the slow death of ash trees,"Chris JacksonPresenter, Inside Out, North East & Cumbria At primary school I remember learning how to identify trees by their leaves or bark. The one I was most interested in spotting was the one that would deliver conkers; the horse-chestnut. Sad to say the ash was no longer lodged in my memory banks when news first broke of this new threat to our woodland. Once pointed out it's relatively easy. In younger ash there is a distinctive smooth silver grey bark and sooty black buds. The branches split off at directly opposing points and the stems bear between nine and 13 leaves in symmetrical pairs with a lone one at the tip. The Forestry Commission website has a more detailed guide. Not only are we being asked to look out for ash, we are also being urged to identify ones that might be infected. When in leaf it's easier to spot because it seems as if the foliage has been damaged by a severe frost and turns limp and black. In winter of course healthy and sick ash trees are difficult to tell apart as the leaves will all have fallen to the ground. A tell tale image is a diamond like mark near a branch joint. You should report any sightings of ash dieback to the Forestry Commission. Monitoring the spread As the Inside Out programme discovers tonight, there is a high-tech means of identifying stricken trees using equipment originally designed for checking war zones for chemical weapons. But this all feels a bit like watching helplessly by as the black death moved relentlessly across Europe centuries ago. There is no cure for ash dieback as it's more commonly known. All we can do is monitor and try and limit its spread. If Denmark's example is anything to go by, then we can expect 90% of our ash to succumb. That equates to around 5% of British woodland. The good news if there is any in this situation, is signs that some ash appear to be either resistant or tolerant of the fungus and do survive. In evolutionary terms it is survival of the fittest in action. It might be time to make sure primary kids can spot an ash tree the next time they are out in the woods.

Criminal injury compensation cuts to be reconsidered,"The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had wanted to restrict payments from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to those suffering serious injuries. But an MoJ spokesman said: ""We have listened to the views expressed in Parliament and will now consider our next steps."" Victims' groups welcomed the move, which they described as a ""turnaround"". The government had said limiting compensation would shave Â£50m off the annual Â£449m bill. Victim Support chief executive Javed Khan said: ""As the charity for victims of crime we are pleased the government has decided to abandon its plans to cut compensation for victims of less serious crimes. ""This turnaround shows the government is listening to victims of crime and taking action to make their needs a priority."" 'Reform' Shadow justice minister Rob Flello also welcomed the move and said: ""Contemplating these cuts that would have affected innocent victims of crime shows this Tory-led government is out of touch."" Critics had accused the government of putting deficit reduction ahead of compassion for victims of crime who would otherwise struggle to get compensation. The MoJ spokesman said: ""The government is committed to providing the best possible support for victims of crime - maintaining compensation for the most seriously affected - and to reforming the criminal injuries compensation scheme to put it on a sustainable financial footing."" The change comes a week after Chris Grayling replaced Ken Clarke as Justice Secretary, a move which was seen by political analysts as being a move to the right. 'Innocent victims' Just last week Justice Minister Helen Grant defended the planned changes in the Commons. She said at the time: ""We concluded that the scheme needed to focus resources on the victims who are most seriously affected by injuries that they suffer as a result of deliberate violent crime committed in England, Wales and Scotland. ""We believe that the provision of support services for victims at the point of need is a much better use of money than providing small amounts of compensation, in some cases long after the incident involved, for relatively minor injuries. ""For that reason we are removing payments for less serious injuries such as sprains and fractures."" But Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins responded by saying: ""To withdraw compensation from these innocent victims of crime goes against the very purpose of criminal injuries compensation and ignores the view held by successive governments for decades that victims of violent crime deserve more than just words. ""No-one asks to be a victim of crime. Reducing, or removing altogether, the amount of compensation available to those people will send a clear message that the state does not view their injuries as serious or important.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Harry Uzoka death: Three guilty of killing London model,"George Koh, 24, stabbed fellow model Harry Uzoka in the heart after he went to settle the dispute, accompanied by two friends on 11 January. Mr Uzoka, 25, who was armed with a dumbbell bar, died in the street outside his Shepherd's Bush home. Koh denied murder, claiming he had two knives because he was scared Mr Uzoka and his friends would beat him up. But an Old Bailey jury found him guilty of murder, along with his machete-wielding friend Merse Dikanda, 24. Personal trainer Jonathan Okigbo, also 24, was convicted of manslaughter. Mr Uzoka was signed with London's Premier Model Management agency and counted catwalk star Jourdan Dunn among his friends. He had recently landed a film role but became annoyed by ""the less successful copycat Koh"", the court heard on Monday. Their relationship deteriorated after Koh bragged to Paris-based model Annecetta Lafon that he had sex with Mr Uzoka's girlfriend, fellow model Ruby Campbell. Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: ""Koh claimed that he knew Uzoka well and then said that he had sex with Uzoka's girlfriend and that was the reason why they no longer talked."" But on January 11, Mr Uzoka received a message from Koh saying: ""Where you I'll come there n we can fight bring ur friends with u."" Mr Uzoka, replied: ""Come Shepherd's Bush."" The defendants took a minicab and confronted Mr Uzoka and his flatmate Adrian Harper outside their address. Mr Harper, who also had a metal pole, told jurors: ""I was expecting a fist fight but I took the bell bar because I knew we were outnumbered. ""I had no idea and did not expect that knives would be used and I would not have gone out if I had thought knives would be used."" When he saw his friend again Mr Uzoka said ""I've been stabbed,"" and collapsed in the road. Giving evidence, Koh said: ""Although Merse had a machete and I had two knives it was Harry who was the aggressor."" Koh, of York Way, Camden, pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a knife. Dikanda, of no fixed abode, denied possessing a machete on 11 January and possessing a knife on 25 January but was convicted of the charges.

Foster carers' concern for children's welfare with cuts,"The Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers said the Welsh government consortium which buys their services is looking to renegotiate their contracts. Philip Sutton from the NAFP said he was concerned councils, through the consortium, were looking to cut costs. The Welsh government said it works with councils to improve foster care. The NAFP represents independent foster carers, who provide just under 40% of placements in Wales. Mr Sutton said he was worried children ""would not thrive in the way we have expected them to"" because of the cuts. ""My main worry is that local authorities, through the consortium, are looking to reduce the cost of placements by reducing the additional services that agencies provide: things like education services and respite services,"" he said. ""They are looking for a basic care provision."" Mr Sutton said he was also concerned that the changes might see children move frequently between placements as foster carers struggled to cope. ""One of the things we always look for in foster caring, which is proved to provide the best possible outcomes, is stability,"" he said. ""You need some kind of help for carers with difficult placements to achieve that. ""If foster carers are not able to access therapy or other services it can make the difference between a placement continuing or breaking down. ""The worry is if we're reducing the availability of therapy and other provisions more placements will break down and it's been shown clearly that children who have multiple placements don't do well in life generally."" 'Emotive issue' Among other changes Mr Sutton said are being proposed are plans to cut the mileage allowance that foster carers can claim for trips, such as hospital appointments. He described this as an ""emotive"" issue and something that some providers might find difficult to continue. The Welsh government said it is working with councils to improve the commissioning of both local authority and independent foster care. ""Placement choice and stability are key to securing better outcomes of looked-after children in Wales,"" a spokesperson said. ""Local authorities must secure a range of local and independent placements to meet the diverse needs of children in their area.

Disputed Â£92m Lincoln Eastern Bypass scheme gets green light,"Lincoln's controversial Eastern Bypass will link the A158 Wragby Road with the A15 Sleaford Road. Hundreds of people objected to the scheme which would close a route into the city from three villages. But the Department for Transport has now approved the plans, which Lincolnshire County Council said would reduce congestion. Work is expected to start in the summer and take two years to complete. 'Cut off' The multimillion-pound project has been delayed by protests from villagers in Cherry Willingham, Reepham and Fiskerton. Most of the objections centred on concerns that the five-mile single carriageway would block Hawthorne Road and residents would no longer be able to use it to travel into the city. The council's previous plans were rejected by the government in 2014 because of safety concerns over a bridge, which has now been redesigned. Councillor Richard Davies said: ""I am glad the inspector saw that not only is the bypass a vital component in our plans to create a fit-for-purpose highways infrastructure for the needs of an expanding Lincoln, but that the changes at Hawthorn Road have been mitigated by the provision of reasonably convenient alternative routes."" Analysis: Tim Iredale, BBC Look North political editor It is a city with a rich history, but if the Romans were to invade modern day Lincoln - they would be advised to avoid rush hour. Back in the 1980s, transport planners hoped there would one day be a fully circular ring road surrounding the city. The eastern bypass is the latest piece of that jigsaw, but many will argue this growing city needs further investment in its road network to avoid the misery of gridlock. It took years of delay and two public inquiries before the project got the go-ahead. Lincoln's MP Karl McCartney said his long term aim was to ensure the route becomes a dual carriageway. A second inquiry held in August heard restricted access by some villages would be balanced by its benefits. The transport authority said it had now reviewed the planning inspector's report and approved the council's plans. Councillor Ian Fleetwood, who represents Cherry Willingham, said the announcement would be met with disappointment. ""The local people will certainly see themselves being cut off from their preferred route towards [Lincoln].""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Channel migrants: More than 60 people found on Boxing Day,"Forty-nine people in four boats were met by Border Force and brought to England, while a further two boats were dealt with by French authorities. The Home Office said it would try to return anyone who arrived in the UK illegally back to mainland Europe. Charity workers said the government's ""tough talk"" was ""extremely irresponsible"". A search-and-rescue operation was launched in the early hours, with a coastguard helicopter, aeroplane and two Border Force vessels taking part. An RNLI lifeboat was launched from Dover shortly before midnight on Christmas Day. French authorities rescued 14 migrants, some of whom were said to be suffering from hypothermia, after a dinghy got into trouble off the coast of Boulogne-sur-Mer. They were met by border police and medics on their return to the French port. 'Jesus was a refugee' Since January, more than 120 people who arrived in small boats have been sent back to European countries, the Home Office said. In the same period, more than 1,800 people have crossed the Channel in such vessels. The Home Office said: ""Illegal migration is a criminal activity. Those who seek to come to the UK illegally and the ruthless criminals who facilitate journeys are all breaking the law and endangering lives. ""When people arrive on our shores unlawfully, we will work to return them to mainland Europe."" It said patrols of French beaches had doubled, with ""drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment"" deployed. Kent Refugee Action Network's Bridget Chapman, who works directly with asylum seekers arriving by boat, said the Home Office's response was ""disgraceful"". She said the government's ""very tough talk"" did not ""take account of international law,"" citing the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention, which states that ""refugees should not be penalised for their illegal entry"". She added: ""There is no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker."" Ms Chapman said it was an ""extremely irresponsible statement,"" which ""appears to be politically motivated and designed to whip up ill feeling towards desperate people"". ""I would remind the Home Office that Jesus was a refugee,"" she added. ""Would they have turned him away?"" Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, which often encounters migrants before they attempt the crossing, said it was ""disappointing to see the Home Office criminalising refugees in this way"". She added: ""Nearly all the people we work with in France have genuine asylum claims. ""The issue is that there is no safe and legal way for them to get [to England] and have their claims heard.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Spy apprenticeship: Government launches new scheme,"Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the scheme during a visit to Bletchley Park where codebreakers helped to shorten World War II. Until now going to university was traditionally seen as the route into one of the intelligence agencies. Mr Hague also praised those who worked at Bletchley Park in the war. The foreign secretary spoke of the need to find and nurture the next generation of codebreakers and computer scientists to work against modern threats. 'Key to success' The aim of the scheme is to find up to 100 new recruits, primarily for the communications intelligence agency GCHQ in Cheltenham, the successor to Bletchley Park. They could also find their way into the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) or the Security Service (MI5). The scheme will focus on attracting talented young people who may have vocational qualifications in science, technology or engineering, but who do not necessarily have a degree. Mr Hague said: ""Bletchley Park was the scene of one of the finest achievements in our nation's history. Without the codebreaking geniuses of Bletchley Park our country would have been at a devastating disadvantage during the war. ""Young people are the key to our country's future success, just as they were during the war. It will be the young innovators of this generation who will help keep our country safe in years to come against threats which are every bit as serious as some of those confronted in the past."" The Foreign Office said there was a need to harness experts from the ""Xbox generation"" who had grown up in a world of ""social media, global connectivity and interactive gaming"". The Single Intelligence Account apprenticeship scheme involves a two-year foundation degree course in communications, security and engineering at De Montfort University in Leicester. 'Science interest' Maths professor Barry Cooper from Leeds University, who is an expert on Bletchley codebeaker Alan Turing, welcomed the initiative. Prof Cooper told the BBC: ""The scientific legacy that has come out of Britain is really quite amazing and important to us economically, and the contribution that we've made is important to the world. ""A lot of it depends on young people - it depends on people being interested in the science and having the means to pursue their interests.

"UK 'needs more bureaucrats for Brexit', says ex-diplomat","Sir Simon Fraser was a trade negotiator in Europe and permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office until July 2015. ""I don't think we can avoid an increase in bureaucracy,"" he said, stressing a need for expertise in trade talks. ""Serious thinking has barely begun on the substantive issues,"" he said. Mr Fraser told reporters in London that he expected Prime Minister Theresa May, Chancellor Philip Hammond and the new Brexit Minister, David Davis, to be the key players in negotiating the UK's exit from the EU. Besides Mr Davis, Mrs May gave top posts to two other leading figures in the Leave campaign: Boris Johnson became Foreign Secretary and Liam Fox International Trade Secretary. Mrs May has promised to deliver Brexit because the Leave camp won with 52% of the vote on 23 June. But she will not trigger Article 50 - the formal mechanism for starting Brexit - until next year. After the UK's 1973 accession to the EU - then called the European Economic Community (EEC) - the UK drastically reduced its capacity for negotiating trade deals, because Brussels bureaucrats negotiate deals for the whole EU. ""We have the smallest civil service since World War Two,"" Mr Fraser said, yet the challenge of unpicking the UK's ties to the EU would be ""phenomenally complex"". Recruitment worries Article 50 sets a two-year time-frame for leaving the EU, though it can be extended if the other member states agree to that. Mr Fraser said the separate negotiation of the UK's future relationship with the EU was likely to last much longer. Under EU rules, a member state cannot independently negotiate trade deals until it leaves the EU. But Mr Fraser said ""that doesn't mean the UK can't have preliminary discussions"" about such deals, for example with Australia, India or the US. Among the many uncertainties surrounding Brexit, Mr Fraser said, ""one of the biggest concerns in the private sector is a loss of access to talent, in a knowledge economy"". Many analysts believe that UK withdrawal from the EU single market and tighter British immigration controls would make it harder to recruit specialists from EU countries, for example for the National Health Service and scientific research. Mr Fraser said a Norway-style relationship with the EU - much-discussed in connection with Brexit - would be ""inconsistent with the sovereignty argument"" of the Brexit camp. Norway enjoys the benefits of the EU single market, but pays a high price for it - paying into the EU budget and accepting most EU laws without having any vote on them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Japan PM Abe condemns hostage 'death' video,"Shinzo Abe demanded the release of a second hostage, purported to be Kenji Goto, shown in the video. Japan says it is trying to verify the footage. On Tuesday, Islamic State (IS) said it would kill the two men unless Japan paid $200m (Â£130m) within 72 hours. But IS now appears to be demanding an exchange of captives instead. Mr Goto appears to say IS would swap him for Sajida al-Rishawi - an Iraqi militant held in Jordan. After the latest tape, Mr Abe said Japan would not bow to terrorism. ""This act of terrorism is an outrageous and unacceptable act of violence,"" he said. ""I again strongly demand the immediate release of Mr Kenji Goto unharmed."" In a statement, President Barack Obama said the US ""strongly condemns the brutal murder of Japanese citizen Haruna Yukawa by the terrorist group ISIL [or IS]"". Mr Obama said the US would stand ""shoulder to shoulder'' with Japan. 'Abominable and unforgivable' The video apparently shows Mr Goto holding a picture of what appears to be the body of Mr Yukawa. US National Security Council official Patrick Ventrell said the US was also trying to establish the authenticity of the video and was closely co-ordinating with Japan. Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the video image ""showing a killed Japanese person"" was ""an abominable and unforgivable act of violence"". There is some uncertainty over whether the video released on Saturday actually comes from Islamic State. Unlike similar previous videos, the latest recording does not carry the logo of any IS media arms, and consists of an audio message with a still image. Other official videos have shown moving footage. Haruna Yukawa, 42, was seized by militants in August after going to Syria to set up a private military contracting company, according to reports. Kenji Goto, 47, is a well-known freelance journalist and documentary film-maker who went to Syria in October, reportedly to try to get Mr Yukawa released. In a video released on Tuesday, a masked man was shown standing over kneeling hostages named as Mr Yukawa and Mr Goto and demanding the ransom. The previously announced ransom is the same amount as that pledged in non-military aid for countries fighting IS by Prime Minister Abe during a recent tour of the Middle East.

Chinese firm set to buy House of Fraser,"Sanpower is expected to take an 89% share in the company which would value the business at about Â£450m. The deal is expected to be China's largest foreign retail investment to date. Sanpower Group was founded in Nanjing in 1993 by 49-year-old entrepreneur Yafei Yuan. China stores? It controls more than 100 firms in a range of sectors, from retail to property, including the Nanjing Xinjiekou department store chain. Sanpower currently employs 30,000 people and has assets believed to be worth nearly Â£5bn. It is thought Sanpower plans to invest Â£70m to Â£80m into House of Fraser in order to finance a wide-ranging store revamp and website improvements. It could also take the department store into China by opening new stores or changing some existing sites to the House of Fraser name. House of Fraser generates sales of around Â£1.2bn a year and employs 7,300 people. It also employs 12,000 concession staff at 61 stores. It has conducted a lengthy search for new investors in the past year. Rich history The surprise Sanpower interest, which first emerged at the end of March, came as bankers were putting together plans to float House of Fraser later this year. House of Fraser has been running a dual-track sale process. The company, which was founded in 1849, has been looking for potential buyers while also considering a possible listing on the stock exchange. House of Fraser originally listed on the stock market in 1948, and remained a public company until it was bought by Mohamed al-Fayed in 1985. It was listed again in 1994 before being bought in a Â£350m deal in 2006 by an investment group led by Icelandic businessman Jon Asgeir Johannesson's Baugur Group. Healthy Christmas Talks about a sale to French counterpart Galeries Lafayette ended in January. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley also expressed interest in the department store in 2012, when he looked at buying a minority stake in the business. House of Fraser has a complicated ownership structure with 49% of the holding company, Highland Group Holdings, owned by the representatives of failed Icelandic banks Landesbanki and Glitnir. Chairman Don McCarthy owns 20%, retail entrepreneurs Tom Hunter and Kevin Stanford own 11% and 9% respectively, Lloyds Banking Group has 5%, and other management own 6%. In January, House of Fraser was one of the few department stores to report healthy Christmas sales, while rivals including Marks & Spencer and Debenhams struggled.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Easyjet wants more women in the cockpit,"By Rebecca MarstonBusiness reporter, BBC News The Amy Johnson initiative named after the first female pilot to fly solo from the UK to Australia, prompted a surge in applications. Easyjet says it wants to increase the number further and has set a target for 20% of new pilot cadets to be female. However, it said that target was ""stretching"". Women account for just 6% of Easyet's new pilot intake. The airline has 164 female pilots, of whom 62 are captains, about 14% of the world's total. They include Kate McWilliams, 26, who earlier this year became the world's youngest female captain for a major commercial airline. Based at Gatwick airport, she flies Airbus A319 and A320 planes to locations including Iceland, Israel and Morocco. 'A man's job' Only 3% of commercial airline pilots worldwide are female and just 450 of them have achieved the rank of captain. That means every female captain in the world could fit onto an A380 aircraft. Rival airline BA has also been trying to recruit more female pilots in the past two years. A survey it conducted into why there were so few women applying to fly found reasons ranging from a belief that women could only be cabin crew, to being told flying was a man's job. Easyjet chief executive Carolyn McCall said it was hard to think of another high-profile profession where women were so under-represented. She told the BBC's Today programme that the industry needed to work on stereotyping. Ability ""I still think there are quite firm attitudes about who flies aircraft - and that's from passengers, even female passengers,"" she said. ""There is a very deep perception here, which is that women don't fly planes."" The British Airline Pilots' Association pilots' union, Balpa, said that ability was the most important quality for a pilot. Wendy Pursey, head of membership and career services, said: ""It's great to see airlines trying to redress the balance. Balpa believes the only thing that should matter in securing a job as a pilot should be your ability, not your background, financial situation or gender."" But it said that a more balanced workforce could only be a positive thing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh Tory leader calls for parties to offer 'chance of change',"He said voters had to feel there was a ""real chance of change"". Under Mr Davies, the Tories went backwards at the 2016 assembly election, losing three seats. Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said it was too early to be discussing what should be happening at the 2021 election. Speaking at a press conference Mr Davies - Welsh Tory leader since 2011 - said no party had a ""monopoly on good ideas"". Asked if he was prepared to go into coalition with Plaid Cymru, he said: ""I am not going to put any roadblocks in the way that stop us getting Labour out of government and we have to enthuse the voters to vote for us."" In the 2016 poll the Conservatives lost three seats and slipped behind Plaid. But defections since then mean Mr Davies now leads the biggest opposition group. In his first press briefing of the year, he added: ""I am not going to write the 2021 Conservative manifesto here at the start of 2018. ""I think what's important to acknowledge at the start of 2018 is that from our benches there is this view that we can work together if the will exists in other parties and political groups. ""There are other opportunities as well as outright coalitions and other formulas that can work to get Labour out of government."" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said she would never lead her party into a coalition with the Conservatives. ""I get that, but waters and tides come and go, as such,"" Mr Davies said. ""From our position, we are not talking six months or six weeks out form an election we are laying this out three and a bit years out from an election."" Many supporters of devolution ""feel bitterly let down"" because of Labour's record in charge since the assembly was created in 1999, he argued. ""Therefore it falls to us as opposition parties here today in 2018 to actually put a credible alternative forward for government,"" Mr Davies said. ""Otherwise people, the general public at large, will say 'well what's the point voting in assembly elections?' ""Turnout has been a huge problem and motivating voters to go out at assembly elections is a huge concern for politicians I would suggest who sit here."" Plaid AM Simon Thomas said: ""It's far too early to be discussing what should be happening in the next assembly election or even after the next assembly election. ""If you want an alternative to Labour then Plaid Cymru and Leanne Wood is that alternative."" Describing Theresa May's government as a ""shambles"", he added: ""I don't think they (Conservatives) are a credible alternative in Wales.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ashya King 'not receiving chemotherapy',"By David FentonHealth correspondent, BBC South Today His father said he did not need it as the tumour was now ""in remission"". But a leading UK cancer expert has said, without chemotherapy, children's chances of survival could be reduced. Ashya is being cared for at a private hospital in Spain and is receiving physiotherapy and speech therapy. He is said to be doing well, and even saying a few words. Ashya's story received global attention in August when he was taken from Southampton General Hospital without medical consent, sparking an international hunt. His parents Brett and Naghemeh, of Southsea, Hampshire, took him to Spain where they were arrested and held in a prison in Madrid. They had wanted him to undergo proton beam therapy, which had not been recommended by doctors treating him. The couple were later released and the NHS agreed to fund his treatment in September. Speaking after Ashya finished a course of proton beam therapy at a special clinic in Prague, his father, Brett King, said he did not need a separate course of chemotherapy. He said: ""We came to a conclusion [with] the doctors that, really, he doesn't need it... They've done MRIs that don't show any visible signs that there's a tumour - it's in what they call remission."" 'It responds well' The Motol Hospital, where Ashya had been staying, confirmed no chemotherapy had been given. But a leading cancer expert said, without chemotherapy, the survival rate for children with medulloblastoma - the type of tumour Ashya had - could be significantly reduced from 80% to about 50%. Prof Roger Taylor, vice president of clinical oncology for the Royal College of Radiologists, said chemotherapy in conjunction with radiotherapy was the ""standard course of treatment - without exception"" for children with that type of brain tumour. He said: ""For the last 15 years or more we have been using chemotherapy routinely for all children. It's been known for several decades that medulloblastoma responds well to chemotherapy."" NHS England is expected to pay up to Â£80,000 for Ashya's treatment in Prague. It has so far not commented on the latest development. Dr Cortes Funes, who is caring for Ashya in Spain, told the BBC the boy was doing well and the medical team was waiting to decide what treatment to give him next. He said one option may be a course of immunotherapy, which uses antibodies and stem cells to boost the body's defence against cancer. What is proton beam therapy?

Winterton school stabbing: Girl held in attempted murder probe,"The 61-year-old woman was attacked at about 09:00 BST, in an office at Winterton Community Academy. Humberside Police said a 16-year-old girl had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and was being questioned by officers. The force said the victim was being treated in hospital for ""serious but not life-threatening injuries"". Live updates and more stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire Head teacher Gareth Morris told the BBC a small kitchen knife was used in the attack and a year 11 pupil was subsequently restrained by school staff in the ""isolated incident"", which happened in the victim's office. He said the victim was a ""member of staff who's part of our pastoral support team, not a teacher"". Ch Supt Christine Wilson said officers responded to a ""fight"" in an office at the school, not in a class. ""There was no disruption to any other children, none of whom witnessed the incident,"" she said. ""Children at the school have not been directly affected by this."" The school has no history of any violent incidents, she added. Mr Morris told the BBC: ""There was a very quick response from my staff who dealt immediately with first aid and restrained the student until we waited for the police and the paramedics to arrive,"" ""Although this was... a very serious incident, everybody was safe in school and the school still remains open."" He said it was ""very unusual for anything to happen in the area"". ""We will support our staff directly affected and will be keeping parents updated throughout the day,"" Mr Morris said. Parents were notified in a series of texts sent by the school saying there had been a ""serious incident"" and, while the school would remain open, they were able to collect their children if they wanted to. One parent said she received a text message from her child saying students were ""locked"" in classrooms until after the incident. Mr Morris apologised to those ""who felt panicked"" but said it was important to inform parents their children were safe.

Google v Oracle: Supreme Court declares Google's code copying fair,"Oracle, another tech titan, had sued Google in 2010 for copyright infringement over what it said was copied computer code. Android is now used in an estimated 70% of global smartphones, and damages could have run into the billions. But the Supreme Court let Google off the hook, overturning a lower court's decision it had infringed copyright. The court ruled six to two in favour of Google. At issue was whether Google's use of Oracle's Java API - a widely-used ""building block"" for programmers - counted as ""fair use"" under US copyright law. If it was, the fact that Google was accused of copying more than 11,000 lines of code would not matter. Justice Stephen Breyer, in his written opinion, said that ""to allow enforcement of Oracle's copyright here would risk harm to the public"". So many programmers used and had deep knowledge of Oracle's building blocks that such a move would turn computer code into ""a lock limiting the future creativity of new programs"". ""Oracle alone would hold the key,"" he warned. 'A monopolist' Oracle made clear that it firmly disagreed with the court's judgement, saying that it had increased Google's power further and damaged other companies' ability to compete. ""They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can,"" said Dorian Daley, the company's general counsel, in a statement. ""This behaviour is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices."" Google, meanwhile, painted the decision as a victory for the software industry as a whole. ""Today's Supreme Court decision in Google v Oracle is a big win for innovation, interoperability and computing,"" wrote Ken Walker, the company's senior vice president for global affairs. ""Thanks to the country's leading innovators, software engineers and copyright scholars for their support."" 'Eviscerates copyright' The majority of judges agreed that Google's copying of the Java code - in the particular way it was used - was ""a fair use of that material"". But the judges disagreed on how to apply traditional copyright law to computer code. Justice Breyer, writing for the majority, acknowledged that it is ""difficult to apply traditional copyright concepts in that technological world"". But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that allowing fair use simply because it allows new products to be created effectively redefines the idea. ""That new definition eviscerates copyright,"" he warned. He also lamented that the majority had decided not to rule on whether code was copyrightable, instead saving the question for another day and relying on fair use instead. ""The majority cannot square its fundamentally flawed fair-use analysis with a finding that declaring code is copyrightable,"" he wrote of his peers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police warn of 'inadequate safety' at Greta Thunberg protest,"Avon and Somerset Police say they expect thousands of people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on College Green on Friday to hear the 17-year-old climate activist speak. The force said there was ""potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing"". Parents and carers were advised to make their own safety arrangements. The Swedish climate change campaigner tweeted over the weekend that she would be taking part in the city's youth protest. But in a letter addressed to parents of school-age children, Supt Andy Bennett said the force was ""unable to accurately predict how large this event will be"". ""Social media has gone viral with interest which leads me to believe it will be thousands of people,"" he wrote. ""We have confirmation of people travelling from across the UK by car, bus, coach and train. ""I am told in Hamburg approximately 60,000 came to see Greta speak. Whilst I am not suggesting it will be this big, you can see the scale of the potential attendance."" He said the event had been advertised promising areas suitable for both primary school children and disabled people but as a ""large-scale organic"" event, he said that would ""probably be unachievable"". ""In terms of big crowds, they are dynamic in nature and there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing,"" he warned parents. ""The event has grown so large that the usual controls, stewarding and safety measures that are routinely put in place are unlikely to be scaled up adequately."" He added Park Street and the city centre would also be closed to ""try and mitigate the risks associated with a crowd too large for the College Green open space"". According to one of the protest's organisers, Greta had originally planned to visit London, but as the area planned for the protest in the capital was too small organisers had recommended Bristol instead. Two years ago, the teenage activist started missing lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building, in what turned out to be the beginning of a huge environmental movement. She has become a leading voice for action on climate change, inspiring millions of students to join protests around the world.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sri Lankan rights campaigner Jayalath Jayawardena dies,"By Charles HavilandBBC News, Colombo He had a recent history of heart disease. Dr Jayawardena was a stalwart of the main opposition United National Party and widely admired for his rights work. He featured in Guinness World Records for hosting a long-running television show answering medical queries. After serving as personal physician to President Ranasinghe Premadasa from 1989-93, Dr Jayawardena was elected to parliament in 1994. 'Suffering in silence' Interviewed in 2011 in the Sri Lankan magazine Business Today he said that in the mid 1990s he decided to travel independently to areas controlled by Tamil Tiger rebels to extend medical help, as the region was suffering under an economic embargo. ""I thought I should draw attention to the people who were suffering in silence and who were helpless,"" he said. ""I do not believe in discrimination according to caste, creed, religion or politics. So I opted to go to those areas, of course risking my life."" He brought scarce drugs and sterile medical equipment which helped prevent tetanus and delivered babies in basic conditions, he recalled. The Tamil Tigers labelled him as a spy, while his life and that of his family became - he said - ""highly vulnerable at the hands of Sinhala extremists"". From 2002 to 2004, during a ceasefire which later failed, he served as minister of rehabilitation and resettlement under the then United National Party government. Later, he raised Sri Lankan human rights problems at a variety of international forums - one of the few politicians from the two major parties to regularly do so. In 2010, ministers and MPs of President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government surrounded Dr Jayawardena in parliament, hurling abuse at him, grabbing him by the collar and calling him a ""traitor"". They accused him of inciting protests in Britain against the Sri Lankan government, something he strongly denied. In a BBC interview last year he voiced concern at a spate of abductions and disappearances. ""There is no rule of law in this country and jungle law is prevailing,"" he said. He said the people of the former war zone in the north and east were ""living in fear"" because of the heavy military presence there.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Alexander Vindman, witness 'bullied by Trump', quits US military","Lt Col Alexander Vindman was the victim of a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation"" by the president, his lawyer said. Lt Col Vindman's ""concern"" over a phone call between Mr Trump and Ukraine's president led to a Senate trial. The Republican-majority Senate acquitted the president in February. What has Lt Col Vindman's lawyer said? A statement said he had retired after 21 years of military service because his future would be ""forever limited"". His representative, David Pressman, said Lt Col Vindman had spoken publicly only once on the matter - under subpoena from Congress. He said: ""LTC Vindman did what the law compelled him to do; and for that he was bullied by the president and his proxies."" Mr Pressman added that he had ""put the interests of his country ahead of his own. ""LTC Vindman's patriotism has cost him his career,"" he said. Lt Col Vindman tweeted confirming his decision: On Monday, Senator and Iraq War veteran Tammy Duckworth said she had still not been assured by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper that the White House would not interfere with Lt Col Vindman's promotion to full colonel. However, one senior US defence official told Reuters on Wednesday that Mr Esper had approved Lt Col Vindman's promotion on Monday, and that the list of promotions was to be sent to the White House in the coming days. There has been no response from the White House yet to Lt Col Vindman's retirement. What led to his White House sacking? Testifying in Congress last November, Lt Col Vindman, the White House National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, said he was ""concerned"" after hearing Mr Trump's ""improper"" phone call on 25 July 2019 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call led to Mr Trump's impeachment in December by the Democrat-majority House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democratic lawmakers argued that the president had dangled US aid in exchange for political favours. When asked how he had overcome his fear of retaliation in order to testify, Lt Col Vindman testified: ""Congressman, because this is America... and here, right matters."" After the Senate acquittal, Lt Col Vindman was escorted from the White House. President Trump tweeted at the time: ""Actually, I don't know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don't believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly, &. was given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information.

Birmingham stabbings: Family tribute to Jacob Billington,"Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street in the early hours of Sunday while he was out with old school friends, police said. Seven other people were injured at four locations over a period of 90 minutes. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. West Midlands Police said Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, was on a school reunion night out with friends. One of the group, also 23, was seriously injured and remains in hospital in a critical condition. In a statement Mr Billington's family said: ""Jacob was the light of our life and we have been devastated by his loss. ""He was a funny, caring and wonderful person who was loved by every single person he met. ""He lit up every room with his boundless energy and witty humour and the loss of such a special person will be felt by all who knew him for years to come."" Police were first called out just after 00:30 BST on Sunday at Constitution Hill, where a man sustained a superficial injury. About 20 minutes later they were sent to Livery Street, near Snow Hill railway station, where they found a 30-year-old man with critical injuries and a woman who was also hurt. At 01:50, officers were despatched to Irving Street, where Mr Billington was found with fatal injuries and his friend seriously hurt. About 10 minutes later, police were called to Hurst Street, in the city's Gay Village, to find a 22-year-old woman had been critically injured and two men less badly hurt. Police initially reported the critically injured man's age as 19 and the critically injured woman's as 32. The suspect was arrested at an address in the Selly Oak area of the city at about 04:00 on Monday and remains in custody. Three other people, two men and a woman, from the same property were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Ch Supt Steve Graham said: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with Jacob's family and friends after receiving such shocking news, particularly for those who were sharing their night out with him. ""It's utterly shocking that a friends' reunion should end so brutally.

Slovakian 'slave' trafficked to Burnley for marriage,"The Romany victim's account of being handled as a ""human slave"" read like ""something from a 19th century novel by Dickens"", Preston Crown Court heard. She was taken while on a night out in Hungary, transported to Burnley and sold for marriage, the jury heard. Azam Khan, 34, of Brougham Street held her prisoner, raped and assaulted her. 'Bad people' He had ""married"" her in a sham ceremony at a local mosque. Khan was due to be deported and marriage to an EU national in an Islamic ceremony would have gone some way to allowing him to seek leave to remain in the UK, police said. Officers discovered her thanks to an anonymous tip-off last October. She told police: ""I was so scared for my life. Many times I wanted to run away from them but because of what the bad people told me. ""I didn't know where to run, where to go, or who I could trust. All I wanted to do was go home to my family in Slovakia."" Following a two-month trial, Khan was found guilty of arranging to bring a person to the UK for exploitation, false imprisonment, rape and common assault. Through interviews with the victim it became clear she had been brought to England on a coach, police said. She was kept against her will by Imrich Bodor, 45, and Slovakian Petra Dzudzova, 27, both of Clipstone Street, Bradford. Soon after she was handed over to Afghani Abdul Sabool Shinwary, 38, of Washington Street, Bradford, who sexually assaulted her, and Slovakian Kristina Makunova, 37, of Girlington Road, Bradford. Makunova earlier pleaded guilty to human trafficking and false imprisonment offences and was handed a 51-week prison sentence, which she has already served. The victim was sold to Azam Khan. His relative Nusrat Khan, 40, of Colne Road, Burnley was also found guilty of false imprisonment. Joe Boyd, prosecuting, told the court: ""What links all these people together is a series of events which sound more like something from a 19th century novel by Dickens than anything happening in Europe in the 21st century. ""[The victim] was handled round the continent and this country like a commodity, a human slave.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK to Zuckerberg: Show us you're sincere about regulation,"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter But now the UK's information commissioner has asked him to take action to show he means what he says. Elizabeth Denham has told Facebook to drop its appeal against the Â£500,000 ($655,000) fine she imposed following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Last November Facebook announced that it was appealing against the record fine on the grounds that the regulator had found no evidence that UK users' data had been shared inappropriately with the political consultancy. On Monday the information commissioner said: ""In light of Mark Zuckerberg's statements over the weekend about the need for increased regulation across four areas, including privacy, I expect Facebook to review their current appeal."" Ms Denham had already come out fighting back in November, telling Parliament's International Grand Committee that Facebook had broken data protection law. She said the reasons it gave for the appeal were ""disingenuous"" and accused it of misrepresenting the regulator's rationale for issuing the fine. In his article in the Washington Post, Mr Zuckerberg called for governments to step in with regulation in four areas, including privacy and data portability. He suggested it would be good for the internet if more countries adopted GDPR, Europe's data protection regulation. And he said new privacy regulation in the US should ""establish a way to hold companies such as Facebook accountable by imposing sanctions when we make mistakes"". 'Basic principles' Now, having imposed just such a sanction, the UK's regulator has asked Mr Zuckerberg to show that his warm words about regulation are sincere. A source at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that if Facebook wanted to win back public trust this would be one necessary step. I asked Facebook whether, in the light of those remarks from Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Denham's comments, the appeal against the fine would now be dropped. A spokesman made it clear that was not going to happen, pointing to the reasons for the appeal given back in November. At that time, Facebook's lawyer Anna Benckert argued that the ICO's reasoning ""challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal"". I wrote then that the last-minute decision by Facebook to launch its appeal was hugely risky at a time when it was trying to rebuild its reputation. Now the stakes have just got higher.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Danielle McLaughlin 'raped and strangled' - post mortem,"Danielle McLaughlin, from County Donegal, was found dead in a field close to tourist resorts in Canacona on Tuesday morning.

A local man arrested Wednesday will now face rape as well as murder charges. The 24-year-old accused, whose name has been reported as Vikat Bhagat, appeared in court on Wednesday charged with her murder. Deputy Superintendent Sammy Tavares told local reporters he had confessed to raping and killing the victim. Police have also obtained CCTV footage which shows Ms McLaughlin walking along a street with the suspect. Holi festival Ms McLaughlin had travelled to Goa with a friend from Australia and the women were staying in a beach hut, a Goa police officer told the Associated Press. The pair had been celebrating Holi - a Hindu spring festival - at a nearby village on Monday evening and Ms McLaughlin left the village late at night, he added. Her naked body was found the next day in a field less than 2km (1.2 miles) from Palolem, one of the most popular beaches in south Goa. Some of Danielle McLaughlin's friends are flying to Goa in the hope of accompanying the body home on Friday to Buncrana in County Donegal - a journey that is expected to take up to six days. Her mother, Andrea Brannigan, said the eldest of her five daughters would be ""sadly missed by all"". She said the family were finding it a ""difficult and trying time"" since receiving the ""awful news"" about her daughter's death. People in the western Indian state have been shaken up by the murder, says the BBC's Yogita Limaye at the scene. Goa is very popular with foreign tourists who visit for beach holidays and some are worried its image could be dented. Last year, an Indian court cleared two men of raping and killing British teenager Scarlett Keeling. The 15-year-old was found dead on Goa's popular Anjuna beach in 2008, having drowned after allegedly being plied with drugs. Miss Keeling's mother said her heart sank after hearing of Ms McLaughlin's death. ""It is horrific,"" Fiona MacKeown said. ""My heart breaks for her family and friends. ""I know what they are going through."" Ms McLaughlin had lived in Liverpool and was travelling on a British passport. On Wednesday evening, locals held a vigil at the spot where her body was found. A big green banner had been laid out on the ground reading ""Justice for Danielle"". Photos of her, flowers, and candles were laid out near it.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"UK fracking: Shale gas starts flowing, Cuadrilla says","Operations began at the Lancashire site in October for the first time since 2011 when it was suspended because of earth tremors. There have been suspensions of the renewed underground drilling operations after further tremors in the area. Cuadrilla says the site may provide ""a significant source"" of gas. But local MP Rosie Cooper has said fracking at the site should be banned immediately, following a 1.1 magnitude tremor on Monday - the strongest since work began on 15 October. Since then, the share price in Cuadrilla's parent company AJ Lucas has fallen. According to the British Geological Survey, earthquakes with a magnitude of less than two are not usually felt and, if they are, it is only by people very close to the epicentre. What is fracking? Anti-fracking campaigners, who argue it poses environmental risks, had unsuccessfully tried to stop the process with an injunction bid. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, criticised the fracking industry, saying it had ""produced a deep hole in a muddy field with a small amount of very expensive gas at the bottom"". ""It is truly bewildering how little fossil fuel companies need to offer in order to get whole-hearted, full-throated government support,"" he added. A Cuadrilla spokeswoman said the natural gas had flowed to the surface at the site near Preston New Road, Little Plumpton. The firm said it would spend at least three months operating two horizontal exploratory wells before testing the commercial viability of the gas flow. Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said the volumes were ""small"" but ""a good early indication of the gas potential that we have long talked about"". ""However, it provides early encouragement that the Bowland Shale can provide a significant source of natural gas to heat Lancashire and UK homes and offices and reduce our ever growing reliance on expensive foreign imports,"" he said. Lee Petts, chair of pro-fracking lobbyists Lancashire for Shale, said: ""We think it would be better if some of the Â£2.6 billion a year spent on importing liquefied natural gas was used to buy gas produced onshore here in Lancashire instead, supporting local industry, boosting employment and raising new taxes to spend on public priorities."" A 2.3 magnitude tremor on the Fylde coast in 2011 was probably caused by shale gas test drilling, a study found.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Tax power restrictions 'starting point' for debate, says Cameron","UK ministers want to hold a referendum on allowing the Welsh government to vary income tax rates. Each income tax band could only be moved at the same time and by the same amount - the so-called ""lockstep"". A row over whether to back the lockstep or not led to Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies sacking four members of his shadow cabinet last week. Mr Davies has criticised the lockstep while the four colleagues he sacked said they were supporting the policy of the UK coalition government. Mr Cameron made his comments on the issue while visiting flood-hit areas of Pembrokeshire on Wednesday. 'Low tax party' He did not comment directly on divisions within his party's assembly group, but said: ""What we believe is that we need further devolution here in Wales. ""We want the Welsh assembly to have the power over taxes and we want the Conservative Party to be the low tax party in Wales campaigning here to make sure we help people with the cost of living by keeping the cost of government down and making sure they keep more of their hard-earned money to spend as the choose. ""That's what we stand for, that's what the Welsh Conservatives stand for and I welcome that. ""First of all we need to get the referendum, we need to have the debate about the referendum and the Conservative Party will be supporting a 'Yes' vote, and the starting point for all that is the settlement as set out in the [UK] government's response to the Silk inquiry."" The Silk commission was set up by UK ministers to look into devolved powers and said Wales should be responsible for raising some of the money it spends. Last year, the commission recommended the Welsh government should have the flexibility to move each tax band independently of each other. Nick Ramsay, Antoinette Sandbach, Mohammad Asghar and Janet Finch-Saunders were dismissed from the Welsh Conservatives' shadow cabinet last Wednesday. The rebels disagreed with Mr Davies's opposition to the lock-step. Two of them had said they could not support a position which went against the views of the prime minister.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Earl of Cardigan bound over in Savernake Estate row,"The Earl of Cardigan was accused of damaging six pheasant feeders and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit on the Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The 60-year-old appeared at Swindon Crown Court under his full name of David Michael James Brudenell-Bruce. He agreed to be bound over for 12 months for the sum of Â£200. The Earl had been due to stand trial after denying the two charges. Claire Marlow, prosecuting, told the court: ""This defendant is in dispute with the trustees of the Savernake Estate and there are now proceedings in the Chancery Court between this defendant and the trustees. ""These offences are generally of a nuisance and aimed at disrupting the workings of the trustees and the estate. ""They are minor in nature and the defendant agrees to be bound over to stop him behaving like this in the future and to stop him interfering with the employees and the estate."" Mike Pulsford, defending, said the Earl was maintaining his innocence but agreed to be bound over. 'Sensible outcome' ""My client had entered not guilty pleas and he maintains those pleas,"" he said. ""There is a Chancery Court application by my client to remove the two trustees from the Savernake Estate."" Judge Douglas Field told the Earl that if he complied with the terms of being bound over he would hear no more about the case. ""If you don't comply with these terms you might be liable to pay all or some of the money,"" he said. ""This brings an end to these proceedings and I think it is a sensible outcome."" Speaking outside court, the Earl said the case was the 14th set of allegations made against him during his long-running dispute with the trustees. ""Most of them have been dismissed by the police as being too absurd,"" he said. ""The battery I am accused of stealing is still sitting at the bottom of my garden, exactly where it was when this case started. Paintings sold-off ""The gamekeeper had removed all the good pheasant feeders and left only the broken ones. ""Those are the ones I was accused of breaking further."" The Earl said the proceedings in the Chancery Court were about removing John Moore, a barrister's clerk, as a trustee of the 4,500 acre estate. The Earl went to the High Court last year, accusing the trustees of selling off portraits without his knowledge. A judge ruled against the Earl, concluding the paintings were ""held by the trustees"". Last week, the Earl was acquitted by magistrates of assaulting Mr Moore.

Tesco to fight dairy price-fixing fine from OFT,"The supermarket giant was one of nine firms facing penalties totalling close to Â£50m for colluding over the price of milk and cheese in 2002 and 2003. But Tesco expressed ""surprise and dismay"" that it was included in the penalties handed down by the regulator. Tesco denies it colluded with others. The OFT estimated that the collusion saw shoppers pay 2 pence extra for a litre of milk and 2p extra on 100g of cheese. The regulator originally calculated that an extra Â£270m was spent by UK consumers as a result of the price fixing, but no total figure has been included in the final report. Fines reduced The OFT found that Arla, Asda, Dairy Crest, McLelland, Safeway, Sainsbury's, The Cheese Company, Wiseman, and Tesco infringed the Competition Act by co-ordinating rises in the prices consumers paid for certain dairy products in 2002 and, or 2003. The first eight all received leniency after admitting liability. However, Tesco has denied collusion and said it would defend its position vigorously, and ""through the courts if necessary"". ""We surely have now reached the stage where the absurdity of the OFT operating as investigator, prosecutor and judge cannot be allowed to continue,"" said Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Tesco's director of corporate and legal affairs. Tesco's share price was down slightly at 1100BST on Wednesday, as was Morrisons' - the owner of Safeway. Fines were originally set at a total of Â£116m, but were reduced after consultation. For example Wiseman said it had originally reached a settlement of Â£6.1m with the OFT. This sum was reduced to Â£4.2m in March 2010, and is now down to Â£3.2m. The OFT said that supermarkets had indirectly exchanged pricing details with each other via the dairy processors. However, it said that not all the companies were involved in all the infringements that it had found. The final penalties announced by the OFT were Â£9.39m for Asda, Â£7.14m for Dairy Crest, Â£1.66m for McLelland, Â£5.69m for Safeway, Â£11.04m for Sainsbury's, Â£1.26m for The Cheese Company, Â£3.2m for Wiseman and Â£10.43m for Tesco. Although Arla was found to been involved in the infringement regarding milk in 2003, it has not been fined as it alerted the OFT to price fixing and was given immunity. ""Competition in the supermarket sector is generally intense and has delivered significant benefits to shoppers across the UK in terms of innovation, choice and improved value for money,"" said OFT chief executive John Fingleton. ""Our investigation and this final decision will help ensure that this competition is maintained.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google's Street View faces multi-state US probe,"It is the latest in a series of global investigations aimed at the firm. Google has admitted that its Street View cars ""accidentally"" collected data from unsecured wi-fi networks in 30 countries because of some rogue code in the software used by the service. The US investigation will attempt to answer how that code ended up being used by Street View. Google has explained that the data was gathered as it logged wi-fi hotspots to help it develop location-based services. It has since stopped collecting such data. But it has never gone into details about how the software came to be included in the Street View system, saying just that it was the work of a ""single engineer"". The US investigation aims to drill down into Google's working practices. It will ask the search giant who inserted the code and why, whether the data was extracted and why Google saved it. In a letter to the search giant, Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has asked for copies of the company's internal procedures regarding Street View and for exact details of how and when Google learned that its cars were capturing sensitive data. The letter also asks why Google recorded the signal strength and quality of personal and business wireless networks. 'Come clean' Mr Blumenthal said he expected a ""significant number of states to participate"". 30 have so far signed up. He described the accidental collection of data as a ""deeply disturbing invasion of personal privacy"". ""Street View cannot mean Complete View - invading home and business computer networks and vacuuming up personal information and communications. ""Consumers have a right and a need to know what personal information - which could include e-mails, web browsing and passwords - Google may have collected and why. Google must come clean,"" he said. The French data protection agency CNIL has had an early view of some of the information collected and said it included data such as passwords. It said it was considering whether to prosecute the firm. Like many other data protection agencies it had requested Google hand over copies of the data it gathered to find out whether it breached privacy rules. Investigations are also on-going in Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Google said it was working with all the investigators and offering to delete all the sensitive data. It has defended its position with Google boss Eric Schmidt saying there was ""no harm, no foul"" in collecting the snippets of information. ""Who was harmed? Name the person,"" Mr Schmidt said during an interview at the company's annual Zeitgeist conference held in Watford in mid-May.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sellafield partly closed after 'above normal' radiation,"Each building was checked after a perimeter alarm was triggered at the north of the site. The company later said it was naturally occurring background radiation and not attributable to any issue or problem with any operation on site. A spokesman stressed there was no risk to the public or workforce. He added: ""There can be no guessing on nuclear sites"". Rory O'Neill, director of stakeholder relations, said: ""One of the 20-odd site perimeter monitors that we have is registering above normal levels of radiation. ""It's not a level that would trigger any kind of activity on or off site. It's below levels that would demand us to do sheltering or anything like that."" 'Right decision' In a statement, The Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ""We are in constant contact with Sellafield, but we have no reason to believe that it is any more serious than they've said."" Part of the plant is being cleared to allow detailed investigations and the ""relevant experts"" are on site, a Sellafield spokesman said. David Moore, chairman of the West Cumbria Cumbria Stakeholders' Group, an independent watchdog funded by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, said the company's actions did not imply ""anything has gone wrong on the site"". ""They've never been scared to raise the levels for safety,"" he said. ""I think they've taken the right decision here."" Sellafield later said in a statement: ""Our in-air monitors are extremely sensitive and pick up on any abnormality. ""Overnight the monitoring system initially indicated elevated levels of activity. ""Following investigation and analysis, we can now confirm these levels to be naturally occurring background radon. ""We would like to thank our staff and the wider West Cumbrian community for their calm and mature response to events this morning."" Day personnel, agency staff and contractors have been told to stay at home until Monday. Other workers, including transport and utilities personnel, are working as normal ""in support of plant continuity requirements"". Paddy Regan, professor of nuclear physics at the University of Surrey, said removing staff from site in such circumstances was ""standard protocol"" and a ""sensible precaution"" although rare. The alarm would be reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency, but was not currently at a level measured by the International Nuclear Event Scale, Sellafield said. As well as reprocessing nuclear fuel, Sellafield houses most of the country's highly radioactive waste and its whole civil plutonium stockpile. Malcolm Grimston, an energy expert from thinktank Chatham House, said there had been a ""real cultural change"" at the company which meant it was ""much more open and honest"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tamboran: Licence for fracking plans terminated,"Tamboran was granted a petroleum licence in 2011. It had three years to inform the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on its decision to drill or drop their plans. Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said the licence had been terminated as the deadline passed earlier. The company said it is seeking a judicial review of the decision. Tamboran had planned to extract gas using the controversial fracking technique. The terms of licence required the company to drill a borehole to take rock samples and carry out a preliminary environmental review within the three-year time frame. In March, DETI granted a six-month extension until 30 September 2014 for the company to complete the first part of the work programme. However, Ms Foster said she could not extend the deadline again as she did not believe the company could complete their work plan. ""There has been much engagement with Tamboran and we have assessed that they have not completed their work plan in terms of the licence and, therefore, we will not be extending it any further,"" she said. 'Close the door' Tamboran said it had requested an extension of the deadline after informing DETI that it would be moving for a judicial review of the decision by Environment Minister Mark H Durkan to reject its request to drill a borehole at the site. In a statement, the company added: ""After investing in excess of Â£3m to date, we are disappointed that DETI failed to consider the option of a temporary extension pending clarification by the court as to the timelines for the judicial review. ""This decision as it stands could close the door on a project that could deliver up to 50 years of secure energy supply, in excess of 2,000 jobs and billions of much needed investment in the local economy."" Tamboran moved on to the site of a quarry near Belcoo in July and said it planned to drill a 750m deep borehole to see if the levels of gas would make extraction commercially viable. The move led to protests by those opposed to gas exploration and fracking. Protesters said they feared a borehole could be the first step towards setting up an industry that they believe could damage the environment and the health of people living nearby. In August, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said drilling could have a significant impact on the environment and ruled that Tamboran would have to make a full planning application with an accompanying environmental statement before drilling at the site. Tamboran said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the decision and would be reviewing its position.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra - and 6 other whirlwind A-list engagements,"By Taylor-Dior RumbleEntertainment Reporter A source told People that the musician proposed to the Quantico actress in London last week. Neither Jonas or Chopra have confirmed the reports, but that didn't stop fans from congratulating them (and commiserating each other). But they aren't the only ones in Hollywood to have got engaged after whirlwind romances. 1. Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin The 24-year-old pop superstar got engaged to the model earlier this month after reportedly popping the question at a Bahamas resort. The couple had only recently reunited after dating back in 2016. The singer confirmed the news on Instagram and wrote: ""Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly."" 2. Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee The stars of today seem pretty tame compared to Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, who got married just a few days after meeting. Gotta love the '90s. They had two sons together before the Baywatch star filed for divorce. 3. Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Ariana Grande blindsided fans when she confirmed the end of her relationship with rapper Mac Miller in May 2018. And after a few weeks of dating comedian Pete Davidson, she shocked her fans again when he announced their engagement in June. Safe to say, Pete loves her harder. 4. Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon Although they were an unlikely match, the couple wed in the Caribbean in April 2008 after just over a month of dating. In 2014, the comedian filed for divorce and it was finalised in 2016. They had twins, Moroccan and Monroe, and make co-parenting look like a total breeze. 5. Britney Spears and Kevin Federline The iconic pop star married her backup dancer Kevin Federline in June 2004, less than three months after they met. The pair welcomed two sons and had nothing short of a toxic relationship, which was chronicled in Spears' first reality show Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. Need we say more? They divorced in 2007 and Spears hasn't remarried since. 6. Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries The reality star got engaged to the NBA player in May 2011 after they had been dating since October 2010. They married in August and did a two-part TV special on E! in October - the same month Kardashian filed for divorce, after 72 days of marriage.

"North Korea access to outside media up, says US study","The government was unable to maintain a ''total monopoly'' over information and the people's ''understanding of the world is changing'', said the report. Viewing of foreign DVDs in North Korea, especially, had risen sharply. Most of these DVDs were South Korean dramas, and had been smuggled across the border with China, said the report , commissioned by the US government. ""When you get very well-produced, compelling South Korean dramas - a picture into a place that you've been fascinated with your whole life, because so much North Korean propaganda revolves around South Korea - that's extremely powerful,"" said Nat Kretchun, one of the authors of the study. The study was conducted by global consulting group InterMedia over the last two years. The findings were based on a survey of 250 North Koreans - mostly refugees and a handful of travellers, as well as expert interviews. Almost half the respondents said they had watched a foreign DVD. 'Less fearful' North Korea has traditionally been ranked as the country with the lowest media freedom in the world. While the majority of North Koreans still did not have direct access to foreign media, the number of those who did ''appears to be steadily increasing'', the report said. North Koreans are also ''less fearful of sharing that information than before'', it said. Near the border with China and South Korea television viewing is also popular, with a third who said they watched TV claiming to have viewed foreign broadcasts. Foreign radio broadcasts, the report added, ''remain important as a source of real-time, sensitive outside news''. The ''elites'' - those with greater financial means or influence - have more access to external sources of media. Recently, the report found, devices such as computers, USB drives and illegal Chinese mobile phones ''have begun entering North Korea in substantial numbers, especially among the elite''. However, a personal network - well-connected friends and ''word-of-mouth'' - remain the most trusted source of unsanctioned information among those the study interviewed. The increased access to external sources of information could lead North Koreans to view their own government with a more critical eye, the report concluded. ''While significant bottom-up pressure on the regime is unlikely in the short term, many people in North Korea are beginning to look more critically at the basic premises of their country's power structure and policies,'' it said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fraud accused says MP Carolyn Harris attacked her,"Jenny Lee Clarke, who used to manage Carolyn Harris's constituency office in Swansea East, is accused of raising her salary by Â£2,000 and cutting her hours. Ms Clarke told Cardiff Crown Court the Welsh Labour deputy leader ""just attacked me"". Mrs Harris has denied it. Ms Clarke, 42, from Swansea, denies committing forgery and fraud in 2015. The court heard the alleged attack happened when both women were both working for Sian James, who was the incumbent MP at the time. Ms Clarke told jurors she had been sitting at her desk, with Mrs Harris rubbing her shoulders, when the future MP ""grabbed"" her head and shook her ""violently"". ""She just attacked me,"" the defendant said, adding that after the attack Mrs Harris was ""on her hands and knees saying sorry [and] she loved me more than her son"". The court heard Ms Clarke did not report the incident to police or Ms James at the time, but did see a doctor and took time off work. Mrs Harris, who became an MP in May 2015 after Ms James stood down, denied the claims during the trial. Ms Clarke said ""everything changed"" when Mrs Harris became an MP because ""her ego went through the roof"". She said her new boss ""detested paperwork"" and that she would regularly sign official parliamentary forms in Mrs Harris' name. The court heard she would also sign and send off forms to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), the body responsible for payroll in parliament. Asked if she signed Ipsa forms in Mrs Harris's name, the defendant replied: ""Yes and other forms, all forms, whatever she needed, as and when, I did what I was told,"" adding her boss would say ""just sign it and send it off"". The court previously heard the pair later fell out after Ms Clarke was appointed and the office manager was sacked before the alleged fraud came to light. Ms Clarke, who initially earned Â£37,000 a year, is accused of increasing it to Â£39,000 while cutting her hours from 40 to 37-and-a-half a week in the months after the 2015 General Election. 'Never discussed' Giving evidence, the defendant said: ""I signed the form, on Carolyn's instructions."" Asked if she intended to be dishonest or mislead anyone, she replied each time: ""No."" She said she was under the instruction of Mrs Harris to give herself ""a couple of thousand"" when she was changing the contract of another employee. The court has previously heard that Mrs Harris, who is shadow minister for women and equalities, said a pay rise ""was never discussed"". Jurors have also heard that Mrs Harris had been warned about making comments regarding Ms Clarke's sexuality and frequently made comments about her choice of clothes and hairstyles, but defended the comments as ""office banter"".

Windrush scandal: Compensation could be capped under proposed scheme,"Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high payment"". But Labour said some victims had been left destitute and needed urgent help. Many migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly declared illegal immigrants, despite having been granted permission to settle in the UK. As a result some were threatened with deportation, the loss of their jobs, and others were denied benefits and healthcare on the NHS. Migrants from the Commonwealth Caribbean were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s. In May it was revealed that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation - named after the boat that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK - had been wrongfully removed since 2002. Under the proposed compensation scheme, fees from unsuccessful immigration applications could be compensated. The refusal of benefits payments, denial of healthcare on the NHS, and issues with social housing would also be considered under the proposed scheme. But in its current form these payments would be capped to ""ensure that no individual receives a disproportionately high payment from the public purse"". The government has also suggested a ""minimum size of claim"" to avoid high costs on processing ""low value claims"". ""We believe that both these measures would help to avoid any excessively high payments and protect the taxpayer from processing very low value claims,"" the proposal said. The compensation scheme will also take into account stress, anxiety and depression that was caused to individuals uncertain of whether they would be allowed to live in the UK. Eligibility for compensation would mirror the Windrush Scheme, which was set up by the Home Office to help migrants establish their lawful status. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Today marks an important milestone in our efforts to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation - who have made such a massive contribution to the UK."" He added he hoped it would ""help to right the wrongs suffered by those of the Windrush generation who have faced difficulties and suffered losses as a result of measures that are in place to tackle illegal immigration"". The consultation will run for 12 weeks and people and those affected are encouraged to give their views. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Mr Javid and said victims ""cannot wait until October for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme"". She added that victims had been left ""destitute"" by the scandal, and accused the government of ""dragging its feet"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greene King Black Boy pubs renamed in 'anti-racist' move,"Greene King has changed the names of three pubs called The Black Boy, and another called The Black's Head. Managing director Wayne Shurvinton said there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism"". Dr Halima Begum, of The Runnymede Trust, welcomed the news, saying the names had been a continual reminder of a ""history of oppression"". The Black Boy pubs - in Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury in Suffolk, and Shinfield in Berkshire - along with the Black's Head, in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, have been given new names, but Greene King says it will take a while for the signage to be changed. It is believed there are about 70 pubs called The Black Boy in the UK, and there remains no consensus on where the name comes from. Links to the mining industry and a nickname for King Charles II have both been cited as possibilities. Another theory relates to Native American figures placed outside premises to sell tobacco. Mr Shurvinton said ""despite the obscure origins"" there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism, which is why we knew we had to take this step if we wanted to continue on our journey to become a truly anti-racist organisation"". What's in a name? New names were decided for the pubs following online polls, in which more than 7,000 people took part. Last year, the pub chain apologised for its historical links to the slave trade. It was founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who owned highly profitable plantations. Greene King said it was working on plans to invest in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, after consulting with staff. Dr Begum, chief executive of racial equality charity The Runnymede Trust, said Greene King should be acknowledged for taking steps regarding its founder's exploitation of black people and for being open about its historical links to slavery. She said: ""The company has made several symbolic efforts to address its founder's legacy of oppression, not least by diversifying its hiring practices and through its work with the Slavery Museum in Liverpool - but is the renaming of a few pubs enough to make amends? No. Not in the slightest. ""No doubt members of BAME communities walk past these hostelries and read the names above the door every day. They are essentially having the history of oppression rubbed in their faces on a daily basis. ""We should not single out Greene King. Many companies that remain household names today profited from the unconscionable ownership and exploitation of black people."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

"France: More than 2,500 break virus restrictions at illegal rave","Some of the 2,500 ravers in Lieuron near Rennes in Brittany had planned to party until Tuesday. Police issued fines to revellers found leaving and the organisers were being identified as the party ended. A number of party-goers were from the UK and Spain, police said. Attendees clashed with police, setting fire to a car and throwing objects at officers attempting to shut the event down. At least three officers were injured. A driver was apprehended with turntables, speakers and a generator in the boot of the vehicle, according to French TV station BFM TV. Police trying to stop the event faced ""fierce hostility from many partygoers"", a statement from local authorities said. But at 05:30 local time on Saturday the ravers began to accept the party was over and started to leave the two disused warehouse hangars, the local prefecture said. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said on Twitter that trucks, sound equipment and generators were seized at the scene and an investigation has been opened. More than 1,200 fines were issued for non-compliance with the curfew, not wearing a mask and attending an illegal gathering, Mr Darmanin said. On Friday authorities said they had opened a sanitary cordon around the party and anyone leaving the event was urged to self-isolate for seven days. One of the party-goers, who gave his name as Jo, told the AFP news agency that ""very few had respected social distancing"" at the event. A number of people slept in their cars before returning to dance, Le Monde newspaper reports. One reveller told Le Monde that the rave was ""very well organised"" with food stalls inside. Another, who came with four friends from Finisterre in north-west France, told the newspaper that she had wanted to ""escape"" for a few hours. On Friday an interior ministry crisis meeting was held and all vehicle exits from the rave were blocked as police sought to shut down the party. France introduced strict rules ahead of the New Year including a curfew from 20:00 until 06:00. More than 100,000 police officers were deployed across the country to break up parties and enforce the curfew. Officers were instructed to break up underground parties as soon as they were reported, fine participants and identify the organisers. France has recorded more than 2.6 million coronavirus cases and 64,892 deaths since the pandemic began. Officers elsewhere in Europe have also had to break up events in recent days. Police dispersed a mass gathering near the Spanish city of Barcelona on Saturday where 300 people had been partying for more than 40 hours. Three footballers from London-based football team Tottenham Hotspur were photographed at a Christmas party last week in breach of coronavirus regulations. And in Essex, an illegal New Year's Eve party damaged All Saints Church near Brentwood. Church authorities have since received hundreds of pounds to pay for repairs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cardiff Airport to get loan fund of up to Â£13m to attract new airlines,"The first Â£3.5m of the loan, from the Welsh government, will be drawn down by the airport next year. Welsh ministers have described the loan as the most significant step since they bought the airport 18 months ago. On Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said its future lies in long-haul flights, not competing with Bristol on closer destinations. Because the funding is in the form of a commercial loan the airport will by-pass many of the EU regulations on state aid. The last time such a fund was made available was in 2006 when Â£4m was used by the then privately-owned airport. Cardiff Airport has had mixed fortunes under public ownership. It was bought by the Welsh government for Â£52m in March 2013 and has invested about Â£10m in improvements at the terminal. A general decline in passenger numbers was halted, although figures for September showed a 7% reduction on the year. Earlier in November, the German airline Germanwings announced it was ending flights between Cardiff and Dusseldorf in 2015, following on from Cityjet scrapping a service to Glasgow. But Ryanair has returned to the airport after an eight-year gap with a weekly flight to Tenerife. Stability Speaking on BBC's Good Morning Wales radio programme, Welsh Conservative assembly leader Andrew RT Davies said looking at the figures, the government had ""not done a very good job"" since taking over the airport. ""Regrettably, there's been a year-on-year decline of 7% in passenger figures. We know of a series of airlines that have chosen to pull out... and we know the most senior executive there, the managing director, left very quickly at the end of August,"" he said. ""There doesn't seem to be much stability there, but what we need to do is make sure an airport works for Wales and the Welsh economy."" However he added he did welcome the route development fund announcement but said the government had been slow to put it in place. ""For an airport to be successful, you need airlines to use it and you also need those routes to bring people in as well as take people out because obviously the more people you bring in that's a greater boost to the Welsh economy,"" he said. Analysis by BBC political editor Nick Servini One of the huge challenges that we have had all along since the government announced it was going to buy the airport is how to try to challenge this highly successful commercial operation in Bristol airport, which has something like 5m passengers a year. Cardiff is around the 1m mark. The route development fund is an attempt to deal with that. We are moving into the second phase now following the decision to put the airport into public ownership. From a passenger's perspective, all they want to know about is what kind of routes and what kind of offer there is going to be and there is a big hope this can make a difference.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fifa 20: 'I play it at home and now my song is on the game',"By Levi Jouavel and Kirsty GrantNewsbeat reporters Yizzy, 19, has gone from studying and playing Fifa to having his song Hustle Hard featured on the game's soundtrack. The rapper, from Lewisham, south east London, told Radio 1 Newsbeat finding out was ""a surreal feeling"". ""I wrote the song a while ago, I was going through a difficult time in my music career,"" he says. ""It's all about working hard and being very driven."" Hard Hustle will be heard when gamers pick Fifa 20's Volta mode - which allows players to choose to play street football. Other artists that feature on the soundtrack include Wiley and Skepta. Yizzy started making grime music when he was 16 and stayed up late writing songs before his GCSE exams. ""All my old school books have got lyrics in the back of them, I was writing bars non-stop,"" he says. The rapper started getting noticed after he was a runner-up in the Glastonbury 2017 Emerging Talent competition. Since then he has released a number of singles and EP - his latest is called Welcome to Grime Street - and says all of his hard work is for his family. The chorus of Hustle Hard includes the line ""I'm trying to stack for my mother's yard"". ""Everyone has something that motivates them, for me that's my mum and my brothers."" Yizzy says he hopes his track being on Fifa 20 allows his music to be heard worldwide. ""I still don't think it's sunk in properly, I went to the Fifa 20 launch and actually saw my song on the game. ""It's quite surreal to be part of a game that I grew up playing and loving for a number of years."" The rapper says it's a big deal being named alongside grime pioneers as well artists like Foals and Jorja Smith. ""I like to think my song being chosen means that although I might not have as much experience as the bigger artists, I can be stood and recognised alongside them.""

HIV flushed out by cancer drug,"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website The cornerstone of treatment, anti-retroviral therapy, kills the virus in the bloodstream but leaves ""HIV reservoirs"" untouched. The study, published in PLoS Pathogens, showed the drug was ""highly potent"" at reactivating hidden HIV. Experts said the findings were interesting, but it was important to know if the drug was safe in patients. The power of the HIV reservoir was shown with the case of the Mississippi baby. She was given antiretroviral drugs at birth. Despite appearing to be free of HIV for nearly two years after stopping treatment, she was found to be harbouring the virus. 'Kick and kill' A strategy known as ""kick and kill"" is thought to be key to curing HIV - the kick would wake up the dormant HIV allowing the drugs to kill it. The team at the UC Davis School of Medicine investigated PEP005 - one of the ingredients in a treatment to prevent cancer in sun-damaged skin. They tested the drug in cells grown in the laboratory and in parts of the immune system taken from 13 people with HIV. The report said ""PEP005 is highly potent in reactivating latent HIV"" and that the chemical represents ""a new group of lead compounds for combating HIV"". One of the researchers, Dr Satya Dandekar, said: ""We are excited to have identified an outstanding candidate for HIV reactivation and eradication that is already approved and is being used in patients. ""This molecule has great potential to advance into translational and clinical studies."" However, the drug has still not been tested in people who are HIV-positive. Prof Sharon Lewin, from the University of Melbourne, said the results were ""interesting"" and marked an ""important advance in finding new compounds that can activate latent HIV"". She told the BBC: ""This study adds another family of drugs to test to potentially eliminate long-lived forms of HIV although much more work needs to be done to see if this works in patients. ""Although PEP005 is part of an FDA approved drug, it will first take some time to work out if it is safe to use in the setting of HIV.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts,"The Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd was taken over by a limited company and charity after it closed in 2014. A statement on its Facebook page said it closed its doors on Saturday. A spokesman for the GMB union said: ""It is an appalling way to treat people - they're being told they're losing their jobs three days before Christmas."" A worker said staff had been in tears. Jessica Sullivan, 34, from Merthyr Tydfil, worked as a box office manager at the centre for almost year. ""I'm seething in all honesty, not only for myself but the team as a whole,"" she said. ""We have a single mother, another member of staff expecting a child, another 24-year-old with two kids. We don't feel we've been valued in the slightest. We've been treated like fools."" The centre was part of Rhondda Cynon Taf council's portfolio until 2015 when it closed the Muni and transferred the lease to keep it open for the community. Its statement on Facebook said the last three years had been ""dogged by financial difficulties, and with no core funding we were not able realise our vision"". It added: ""Unfortunately, in the past year the debts increased significantly and an independent examination of accounts showed our true financial position which had become untenable."" 'Changing the locks' It thanked staff, board members, volunteers, the town council and officers at the county borough council, who it said had worked ""exceedingly hard"". But Gareth Morgans, from the GMB, said about 14 staff ""were due to be paid today by transfer but the letter says they'll have to go through the insolvency service"". He said: ""They knew it was coming, but every time they approached management they were told there was nothing to worry about - they were given false security. ""The very same time they were being told they'd lost their jobs, there were locksmiths in changing the locks."" Yvonne Murphy, who was recently appointed artistic director of the centre, said in her blog it was ""closing its doors on a community who love it and need it"". ""This is a story of poor management and bad decisions,"" she added.

Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis' death 'caused by heading balls',"Alan Jarvis played for Everton and Hull City in the 1960s and 1970s, winning three caps for his country. The 76-year-old, who had dementia, died at a nursing home in Mold, Flintshire, in December. On Thursday coroner John Gittins concluded former midfielder Mr Jarvis died from Alzheimer's ""caused by his occupation"". Mr Jarvis played for Wales against England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, earning his other caps against Scotland and Northern Ireland. His family had arranged to have his brain donated to researchers at the University of Glasgow after his death after fears that repeatedly heading the ball had caused his speech to deteriorate and his behaviour to change. The footballer signed to play for Everton when he was 17, and was transferred to Hull City and then Mansfield Town, before retiring at the age of 30 and working as a quantity surveyor until he retired. The Ruthin inquest heard how Mr Jarvis' wife Dilys said he had been a ""very kind man"", but in 2006 his behaviour started to change, and in 2012 he went into full-time care. ""He was easy-going but because of his condition would shout and hit me,"" the statement read. ""I think the head injuries coupled with heading those heavy leather balls constantly contributed greatly to his death. ""He was a very kind person, always helping people. We miss him."" Dr William Stuart, a consultant neuropathologist who studied Mr Jarvis' brain, said mortality with Alzheimer's disease was five times higher in former professional footballers than the general population. ""The complex pathologies in Mr Jarvis' case is consistent with observations of neuro degenerative disease in former contact sport athletes,"" he said in a report. Dr Stewart's research featured in the 2018 BBC documentary Alan Shearer: Dementia, Football and Me. Mr Gittins reached a conclusion of death from an industrial disease. He said: ""I am not saying playing football always causes dementia but, on the balance of probabilities in Mr Jarvis' case, his previous Footballer's dementia 'caused by heading balls' occupational history has been a factor in his neuro generative functioning and had led to Alzheimer's disease. ""It is a result of his occupation."" 'It confirmed what we have always known' His daughter, Sarah Jarvis, of Northop, Flintshire, said her father loved football but the inquest had confirmed what the family had ""always thought and known"". ""He probably headed [the ball] quite a lot, but he had a big injury [when he was at Mansfield] where he was knocked out, carried off the pitch and he was in hospital for two weeks,"" she said. ""The ball was hard enough that when it hit him, it detached his retina."" She added: ""Players are getting these awful illnesses and it's such a massive trauma for the families to have to look after their family member. ""As they deteriorate you miss a bit more of them every time, it's very upsetting. ""In the end, he died in such a horrible way, you don't wish it on anybody.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australian casino shares tumble after China arrests,"Crown Resorts, controlled by James Packer, closed 13.9% lower after Crown confirmed 18 of its staff had been detained in China. Among those arrested was a senior executive in charge of attracting high-rollers to Australia. Most gambling is illegal on mainland China, and soliciting its citizens to gamble overseas is also banned. But some firms have continued to market resort and tourism services where their casinos are located. Shares in Asian casino operators Sands China, Galaxy Entertainment and MGM China fell about 3% in Hong Kong, while Australia's Star Entertainments shed nearly 4% in Sydney. Wealthy customers Crown said it had not been given any explanation for the arrests and had not been able to speak to its staff. The employees held are 15 local staff as well as three Australian citizens - including Jason O'Connor, the executive vice-president of the firm's VIP International business - a programme aimed at bringing wealthy customers from abroad to Australia. China's foreign ministry told Reuters that it had detained some Australian nationals for suspected ""gambling crimes"" but gave no further explanation. The matter is still being investigated. Julie Bishop, the Australian foreign minister, said consular officials in Shanghai were offering appropriate assistance for the three Australians, all of whom had legal representation provided by Crown. Analysis: Robin Brant, Shanghai correspondent The husband of one of the local Chinese Crown employees arrested has told the BBC he is ""completely dumbfounded"" about why she has been detained. He said his wife was questioned for almost three hours after police arrived at their Shanghai apartment in the early hours of Friday morning. She was taken away and he was formally advised of her arrest yesterday. It's been reported that the arrests are part of a crackdown by the Chinese authorities on foreign casino companies who are suspected of encouraging Chinese nationals to travel abroad to gamble. There is also an ongoing campaign to tackle corruption and international money laundering in China. VIP gambling Profits from VIP International account for a vital chunk of Crown's revenue. China's citizens are among the world's most prolific gamblers. Many used to travel to the Chinese territory of Macau, but since Beijing's crackdown on corruption targeting the flow of capital overseas, Chinese gamblers have looked elsewhere - and foreign operators have tried to tap into that market. Last year, 13 South Korean casino managers were arrested in China on charges of offering Chinese gamblers free tours, hotels and sexual services. Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong, said the detentions appeared to be a repeat of China's crackdown on South Korean casino marketing efforts. ""The Chinese government seems to be making a clear statement about its view on gaming activity being offshored to foreign jurisdictions, while Macau is not being targeted in the same way,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google hit with â¬1.5bn fine from EU over advertising,"It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads. Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising - pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn (Â£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017. ""Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. ""This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,"" said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: ""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest. ""We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns. ""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."" Last year, the EU competition authority hit Google with a record â¬4.34bn fine for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. This followed a â¬2.42bn fine in 2017 for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites. AdSense fine The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function. When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result. Google's ""AdSense for search"" product delivers those adverts for website publishers. The Commission described Google as acting like ""an intermediary, like an advertising broker"". In 2006, Google started to include ""exclusivity clauses"" in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said. From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with ""premium placement"" clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts. Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control ""how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be"", the Commission said. Search giant The restrictive clauses ""led to a vicious circle"", Ms Vestager said in a media conference. ""Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,"" she said. ""There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,"" she added. Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Devon hospitals recruit nurses from abroad,"From 273 nurses employed by the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital (RD&E), 72 were from outside of the UK. There are 50 vacancies at the North Devon District Hospital (NDDH), which has so far found 13 nurses and paid more than Â£30,000 in recruitment fees. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said there was a ""recruitment crisis"". The Department of Health disputes this. 'Huge problem' The RD&E said it had recruited a ""significant number"" of registered nurses from both within the UK and overseas. Of the 273 nurses employed in the last 12-months, 70 were from European Union (EU) countries, with the majority from the Republic of Ireland and Spain. It added that two had been recruited from outside the EU. The NDDH said it was working with an international recruitment agency to find nurses, most of which were newly qualified and from Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Derriford Hospital, said following job fairs in Ireland it had made 41 offers of employment to nurses. Jeannett Martin, South West director of the RCN, said in recent years there had been a drop in the number of nursing posts across the country. She said the knock on effect had been a reduction in university places for nurses to train. Ms Martin added it was ""a huge problem"" and if the trend continued there would be fewer nurses to employ. The School of Nursing and Midwifery at Plymouth University said an extra 113 places were being created from September for people to study adult nursing. Torbay Hospital said it had not yet looked for nurses abroad but it was an option it might consider in the future. A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We do not accept there is a national shortage of nurses. ""However, it is up to trusts to recruit and ensure they have appropriate levels of staff. ""If they cannot recruit enough staff locally they may opt to seek nurses from further afield. ""Nurses from abroad have made a very valuable contribution to NHS patient care. However, they should only work in the NHS if they have proven their competence and language skills.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wales child abuse: 38 calls to children's commissioner,"Keith Towler said some were from people wanting to make ""fresh allegations"", and he would welcome further calls. Details of abuse, centred on children's homes in north Wales, began to emerge in the 1990s leading to the Waterhouse inquiry. But victim Steve Messham last week called for a new investigation. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme that the Waterhouse inquiry report, published in 2000, uncovered only a fraction of what had happened. Mr Towler said since Mr Messham's interview on Friday, his office had received 38 calls relating to the issues raised. People wanted to make fresh allegations, share information or talk about the inquiry itself, he said. ""We're taking calls from anywhere and everywhere,"" said Mr Towler. ""Some of them are directly related either to the Waterhouse inquiry or to issues in the north Wales children's homes dating back to the 1970s and 80s. ""Other people are raising other issues related to other matters - you will appreciate I cannot go into the detail of that."" Two new investigations have been announced this week into the scandal. Home Secretary Theresa May announced a police inquiry led by crime agency head Keith Bristow into allegations of child abuse in north Wales in the 70s and 80s. Separately, Mrs Justice Macur will investigate the terms of the Waterhouse abuse inquiry. Mr Towler said he would welcome any calls from members of the public about child abuse in north Wales in the 1970s and 80s or the related inquiries. ""The important part that I'm playing at the moment is that if anybody wants to talk to me they can do so,"" he said. ""I will make sure both Keith Bristow, in relation to the police investigation, and Mrs Justice Macur, who is taking forward the look at the Waterhouse inquiry, will receive the information that I get if appropriate. Mr Towler said he was the ""independent human rights institution for children and young people"". ""Some of the calls my team have been receiving are from people who initially have more confidence in talking to somebody independent to talking to the authorities,"" he said. ""So what I've been doing, what my team have been doing, is handling those calls, making appropriate referrals in terms of information as you would expect to the police and other bodies. Allegations ""I need now to discuss with both Keith Bristow and Mrs Justice Macur how the information I'm receiving is properly and appropriately dealt with in the work they're taking forward."" Allegations of abuse centred around the Bryn Estyn care home in north Wales and involving dozens of other care homes began to emerge in the 1990s. North Wales Police investigated the care home abuse claims in 1991, and seven former care workers were convicted. But it was widely believed that the abuse was on a far greater scale, prompting the ordering of the Waterhouse inquiry in 1996.

Documentary Freedom Fields and films Tell it to the Bees and Wild Rose, which are also from Scotland, are also to get world premieres at TIFF. Produced by the Scottish Documentary Institute, Freedom Fields follows a group of women in Libya brought together by their passion for playing football. Tell it to the Bees is an adaptation of Fiona Shaw's 1950s set novel of the same title. The story chronicles the lesbian romance between a single mother who is dealing with the breakdown of her marriage. It stars Anna Pacquin and Holliday Grainger.

Irish general election: Voting is under way to elect new parliament,"The Irish parliament (DÃ¡il) has reduced in size, meaning any new government needs the support of nearly 80 elected members (called TeachtaÃ­ DÃ¡la or TDs). More than 3m people are eligible to vote, including Irish and UK citizens. Polling stations across 40 different constituencies opened at 07:00 local time (same as GMT) and will close at 22:00 on Friday. More than 2,000 voters living on Irish islands off the coast of counties Donegal, Mayo and Galway got the chance to cast their ballots on Thursday. The sealed ballot boxes were brought back to the mainland where they will be kept in police stations until counting begins on Saturday. The outgoing government was a coalition between the largest political party, Fine Gael, and the Labour Party. Led by Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Enda Kenny from Fine Gael, the coalition had been in power for almost five years, since March 2011. They are being challenged by 13 other parties, including the largest opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il, led by MicheÃ¡l Martin, and Sinn FÃ©in, led by Gerry Adams. There are also a number of independents among the 552 people standing for election. TDs will be elected according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to other candidates. There will be a total of 158 seats in the next parliament, but one of them has already been filled. That is because, under Irish electoral law, the Speaker (Ceann Comhairle) is automatically re-elected unless they have announced their intention to retire. The election count is expected to last over the weekend. 'No selfies' A record number of young people are expected to vote on Friday and this age group, in particular, have been warned that taking photographs of themselves in polling booths is strictly forbidden, as it could identify individual voters and their ballot papers. Cork County Returning Officer Sinead McNamara told Irish broadcaster, RTÃ that ""selfies"" were ""a modern phenomenon"" but electoral officials would not permit them to interfere with the democratic process. ""I know it's nice, particularly for first-time voters - they like to record the fact that they are voting for the first time. That's OK to certain extent, but we'll be saying to our staff 'absolutely no selfies in the polling booth itself'. ""The primary function is to preserve the integrity and secrecy of the ballot, so taking a selfie - it could include a photograph of a marked ballot paper - which is an absolute no-no.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Last of Us 2 leads Bafta Games Awards nominations,"It's the most nominations any game has received in the awards' history, beating last year's record of 11 by two titles: Control and Death Stranding. Ghost of Tsushima, an action-adventure game, also received 10 nominations, including for best game and multiplayer. The winners will be announced on 25 March. The awards will again be held online, a year on from being the first major awards to be held virtually. In addition to its 13 nominations, The Last of Us 2 is also up for a new award - EE Game of the Year, which is the only category to be voted for by the public. The Bafta Games Awards has been recognising achievements in the gaming industry for more than a decade. And while there might not be a traditional red carpet, champagne reception or live audience, organisers will be hoping to retain some of the magic of a live event. Analysis by Steffan Powell, Newsbeat's gaming reporter On paper it might be a surprise that a game set in the midst of a world altering global pandemic became so successful in 2020. Not much escapism in that. It's less of a surprise to anyone who's played The Last of Us Part 2. The shock would have been if the game did not dominate the BAFTA nominations. It's already won big at the 2020 Game awards and was crowned BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue's game of 2020. Despite controversies over its depiction of violence, divisive plot twists and character portrayals (dancing very carefully around spoilers here) the title had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from players and critics. The praise for its storytelling, diverse cast and sheer jaw-dropping emotional moments have also clearly won the BAFTA nominations panel over. Usually a place where independent games thrive - this year the awards look like they could be dominated by PlayStation exclusives made by big studios. Not only does The Last of Us Part 2 have the most nominations for in history, but other PS only titles like Ghost of Tsushima (10), Spiderman: Miles Morales (7) and Dreams (6) have landed a hatful of nominations too. Bafta has announced the show will be a 90-minute online live stream, hosted by presenter and journalist Elle Osili-Wood. See the full list of nominees here.

Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam',"By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" that were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer's bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. ""Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,"" the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters ""that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies"". ""We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,"" a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. ""We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved."" However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. Nor did Facebook - but a spokeswoman said: ""Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation."" Big firms targeted ""Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn't part of their job,"" said James Maude at cyber-security firm Avecto, commenting on the phishing threat facing big companies. ""But people are part of the best security you can have - that's why you have to train them."" He also told the BBC that Avecto's clients have recounted phishing attempts that used senior staff's hacked email accounts to convince employees that a request to wire out money was genuine. The sophistication of phishing scams has increased lately, according to a recent Europol report. ""CEO fraud"" - in which executives are impersonated by the scammer - was a particular worry. ""The request is usually time-sensitive and often coincides with the close of business hours to make verification of the request difficult,"" the report explained. ""Such attacks often take advantage of publicly reported events such as mergers, where there may be some degree of internal flux and uncertainty."" In order to avoid succumbing to such fraud, firms are advised to carefully verify new payment requests before authorising them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US Senate passes sanctions on Iran central bank,"The measures, passed by 100 votes to nil, would ban foreign firms from doing business with the Iranian central bank. Before it can become law, it must be approved by the House and President Barack Obama, who is sceptical. The effort to thwart Iran's alleged nuclear ambitions followed new EU sanctions imposed earlier on Thursday. Meanwhile, diplomats at the Iranian embassy in London must leave Britain by Friday afternoon. They were ordered to go after hundreds of Iranian protesters stormed the UK embassy in Tehran on Tuesday. Oil-price rise? In recent weeks the US has introduced sanctions against Iran's financial sector, although it has stopped short of targeting the central bank outright. President Barack Obama has been cautious about harsher sanctions, fearing such a move could disrupt the oil markets at a time of economic uncertainty for many Americans, and alienate potential allies. US officials have also warned that depriving global markets of Iranian exports could send oil prices sharply higher, gifting Tehran a funding boost. Unless a compromise is reached, the president will have to decide whether to veto it. The US has already forbidden its own banks from dealing directly with the Iranian central bank. Under the new sanctions, drafted by Democrat Robert Menendez and Republican Mark Kirk, foreign banks that do business with Iran's central bank would be cut off from the US financial system. The sanctions are designed to come into effect after a six-month grace period - in order to give oil markets time to factor them in. The measures were part of a much larger $662bn (Â£422bn) defence bill, which also cruised through the Senate on Thursday night. Europe's new sanctions blacklist 180 Iranian officials and firms, but do not impose an oil embargo on Iran, because some European countries are dependent on Iranian oil. Ministers meeting in Brussels also agreed on Thursday to work on other measures targeting Iran's energy sector. The latest round of sanctions follows a recent UN report that linked Iran with the development of a nuclear weapon. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is strictly for civilian purposes. Officials say the latest sanctions are not related to this week's storming of the UK embassy in Iran. The British government says all UK diplomatic staff in Tehran have been evacuated and the embassy closed. Iran has said it regretted the incident, which it described as ""unacceptable behaviour by a small number of protesters"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK ministers halt Scottish fracking ahead of Holyrood move,"UK ministers will, however, consult with companies which have already applied for licences before any final decision is made. New powers over the industry are due to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish government has already announced a moratorium on unconventional oil and gas projects, using its existing powers. UK energy minister Matt Hancock said: ""We've already committed to Scotland having devolved powers for licensing of oil and gas as part of our efforts to give the Scottish government more decision-making powers. ""We agree in principle to their request that no new licences be awarded in Scotland as part of the 14th licensing round, and will consult with companies who have already applied before making a final decision."" The UK government has indicated it will work with the Scottish government on the position of these companies. Decided in Scotland Scottish energy secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""We argued that the decisions over fracking should be decisions for Scotland. ""We first persuaded the UK to abolish their plans to allow fracking to take place beneath people's properties without their consent and secondly we persuaded the UK government that responsibility to determine policy should be passed to Scotland."" Mr Ewing said the move over licences was the logical next step. He added: ""That means that policy over unconventionals in Scotland will be discussed, debated and then decided in Scotland."" Scottish Labour MP Tom Greatrex responded to the news by saying: ""After months of pressure, the government have finally given way to Scottish Labour's demands that it respect the findings of the Smith Commission and suspend any new fracking licenses in Scotland."" He added: ""While eight out of 10 homes still rely on gas for heating, shale gas may have a role to play in displacing some of the gas we currently import and improving our energy security. ""But that potential benefit cannot come at the expense of robust environmental protections or our climate change commitments."" Exploration licences One of the companies intending to develop unconventional energy projects is Ineos, which operates the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth. It issued a statement questioning whether the change was necessary. It said: ""Ineos understands the commitment to devolve powers to Scotland including the development of exploration licences in Scotland. However, it is not in fact necessary to delay awarding of the 14th Round exploration licences in Scotland as the Scottish Government already has effective control over any physical activity on the licences through the planning system. ""Ineos remains committed to engage with local communities in Scotland to provide information on the economic and environmental impact of unconventional oil and gas. ""We believe the best way to assure security of supply and the long term success of the Scottish economy and its manufacturing sector is to develop an indigenous shale gas resource.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jeremy Corbyn says he could work with Andy Burnham as Labour leader,"Mr Burnham had earlier said that if he won he would offer Mr Corbyn a role. But fellow leadership candidate Yvette Cooper said Mr Burnham should withdraw from the race if he was not prepared to oppose the left-winger. And ex-party leader Neil Kinnock said Labour supporters must choose between ""seriously"" contesting elections and being in ""perpetual demonstration"". Lord Kinnock did not directly name Mr Corbyn, the front-runner in the contest according to polls, but criticised those in the party he said were resorting to ""corrosive self-indulgence"". Speaking to BBC Two's Newsnight, he said that being a party of demonstration was ""fulfilling and noble, but rarely effective"". He added: ""I can see why people are angry and want to protest. But then they've got to make a decision on whether they want to be part of a Labour movement that produced a political party to seriously contest for democratic power - or they want to be in perpetual demonstration."" Everything you need to know about the four candidates hoping to become the next Labour leader Also on Newsnight, Mr Corbyn responded to Mr Burnham's conciliatory comments by saying: ""Obviously there has to be a party of all the talents and of course, we can work together, and that's an easy thing to do."" But Mr Burnham's comments prompted criticism from fellow leadership rival Yvette Cooper. Her spokesman said: ""If he [Mr Burnham] isn't prepared to offer an alternative to Jeremy, he needs to step back and leave it to Yvette. ""And he should do the right thing by the party and tell people who do still support him to put second preferences for Yvette - something he is still refusing to do."" Mr Burnham's campaign chief Michael Dugher told The Guardian: ""It's time now to rally behind the only person in this contest who can beat Jeremy Corbyn and that is very clearly Andy Burnham."" Labour leadership contest Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband has declared he is backing the fourth contestant in the leadership race, Liz Kendall. Ms Cooper and Ms Kendall have both said they would not serve in a Jeremy Corbyn shadow cabinet, arguing that policies such as renationalising utilities and scrapping Trident were not credible. But Mr Burnham has tried to strike a more consensual tone, amid speculation he is going after the veteran Mr Corbyn's second preference votes.

UK water industry: How does it work?,"England The water industry in England and Wales is regulated by Ofwat. The regulator has a duty to protect customers' interests, ensure that companies carry out their functions correctly and sets water prices. Ofwat says that there are 18 water companies in England and Wales, 10 of which have licences to provide water and sewage services while eight provide only water services. Following the privatisation of the water industry in 1989, most of the companies operating in England and Wales are privately owned. However, the companies' precise ownership structures differ. United Utilities, Dee Valley Water and Severn Trent Water are among a group of publicly-listed entities. Thames Water is privately owned with investors including the Australian Bank Macquarie and the BT pension fund. Water UK says that customers that consume more than five million litres of water are free to choose their water provider. Wales From a regulatory perspective Wales is treated as part of the same jurisdiction as England, with water companies overseen by Ofwat. The main water and sewage company operating in Wales is Welsh Water, a private company limited by guarantee. That means that the company does not have any shareholders and profits are reinvested into the business. Welsh Water describes itself as the largest provider of water and sewage in Wales and the sixth largest in the UK. Other companies, such as Dee Valley, also operate in Wales. Northern Ireland All water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland are provided by Northern Ireland Water. This was established as a government-owned company in April 2007. The Department for Regional Development, in the devolved administration, is the water company's sole shareholder. The Utility Regulator, which supervises the gas and electricity sectors, also regulates the water industry in Northern Ireland. Unlike the rest of the UK, where customers pay for their water provision, Irish households have their water funded by direct subsidy from the Northern Irish Assembly. There were plans to introduce customer-funded charges in 2007 but these have been deferred. Non-domestic customers in Northern Ireland do not receive a government subsidy for their water provision. Scotland Scotland has one publicly-owned water and sewage company, called Scottish Water. The company provides water to Scottish households and is answerable to the Scottish Parliament. Customer charges are based on the council tax band of their home and are collected as part of the council tax payment. However, since April 2008 non-household customers, such as large companies, are free to choose their water and sewage provider. Water UK says that, as of 2013, 11 companies held a water and/or sewage licence in Scotland. Scottish Water acts as wholesaler to the retail market, where water services are available from licensed providers. The Scottish water industry is overseen by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, or WICS.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hepatitis C vaccine: Oxford researchers' trial 'promising',"Designing a vaccine has been difficult as the virus changes its appearance, making it hard to find something to target. Writing in Science Translational Medicine, researchers say their trial on 41 patients shows it is possible. The Hepatitis C Trust said the findings were very promising. The virus can go unnoticed for years, but during this time it can cause considerable liver damage. In the UK, up to 500,000 people may be infected with the virus. The World Health Organization believes the global figure could be as high as 170 million people. It spreads through blood-to-blood contact such as sharing needles. While infection can be controlled with antiviral drugs, the Oxford University researchers say a vaccine ""would be a major step forward"". Shifting target They attempted to target the inner workings of the virus, rather than the variable surface markings. One of the researchers, Prof Paul Klenerman, said: ""That's where the engine of the virus is, where we may be able to successfully target many of the crucial pieces of machinery."" Cold viruses were modified with genetic material from the hepatitis C virus in order to prime the immune system to attack the hepatitis C virus. The aim of the Phase I trial was to determine whether the treatment was safe and to help plan future trials. Forty-one healthy patients were given the vaccine. Scientists said it produced a ""very strong"" immune response which lasted for at least a year and had no major side-effects. Prof Klenerman said: ""The immune responses we've seen are exciting and we are beginning the next stage of trials. While we are hopeful, it could be a long road to any vaccine that protects people against hepatitis C."" The next step will be to give the vaccine to people at-risk of hepatitis C infection to see whether it protects against the virus. Charles Gore, chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: ""This is very promising research. ""There has been rapid development in drugs to treat hepatitis C, but vaccine development has lagged behind. Yet, if we only treat existing infections, we will always be behind the curve. ""We badly need to improve prevention and this is an excellent step in that direction.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China jails journalist over leaked 'state secrets',"Gao Yu, 71, had ""illegally provided state secrets to foreigners"", the court in Beijing said. China has not confirmed which document the case relates to, but it is thought to be a Communist Party strategy paper known as ""Document No 9"". The paper is said to call for aggressive restrictions on democracy, civil society and the press. Amnesty International called the sentence ""an affront to justice"". Gao was ""the victim of vaguely worded and arbitrary state-secret laws that are used against activists as part of the authorities' attack on freedom of expression"", said William Nee, China researcher at the rights group. Shang Baojun, one of her lawyers, said they were ""very disappointed"" with the verdict and would appeal. Analysis: Celia Hatton, BBC News, Beijing Gao is a rarity in China - an outspoken reporter who chose to work outside the mainstream state media outlets. She filed Chinese language stories to overseas media outlets that were eager to publish her insights. She was also unusual because she appeared to have access to relatively high-level information about the Chinese government and the ruling Communist Party. Though that does not mean, her lawyers insist, that she is guilty of leaking state secrets. Somewhat ironically, the internal Communist Party memo Gao is said to have leaked warns of the dangers posed by ""Western-style"" media outlets. ""Some people, under the pretext of espousing 'freedom of the press' promote the West's idea of journalism,"" the document reads. ""The ultimate goal of advocating the West's view of the media is to hawk the principle of abstract and absolute freedom of press, oppose the Party's leadership in the media, and gouge an opening through which to infiltrate our ideology."" 'Confession' Gao was detained in April 2014. Weeks later, state television network CCTV aired a video of Gao, her face blurred, admitting she made a ""big mistake"". Gao's lawyers said she made the statement after police threatened her son. She was then put on trial in November. Another of her lawyers, Mo Shaoping, told the BBC the forced confession was invalid and would form the basis of the appeal. The highly respected journalist, who has written for media in Hong Kong and elsewhere, has already been imprisoned in the 1990s. She was convicted of sending party documents, including a speech by then-President Jiang Zemin, to a Hong Kong newspaper. Gao's sentencing comes amid a widespread crackdown on freedom of speech in China, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. According to media advocacy group the Committee to Protect Journalists, she is one of 44 Chinese journalists behind bars. The group says that China now has more journalists in prison than any other country.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nearly 200 Wales carers 'had to give up jobs' to look after family,"By India PollockBBC Wales social affairs correspondent Carers Wales found the figure amounted to just under half of the people it surveyed. It has called on organisations to be more supportive of the needs of carers in the workplace. The call comes as it launches a new scheme offering advice to employers about how to support the 181,135 working carers in Wales. Called the Wales Hub of Employers for Carers, it has been funded by Welsh Government. Leanne Brookes cares for her mum, Hilary, who was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease five years ago. With her two sisters, she does all she can to keep her happy and comfortable. Emotionally and practically this can take its toll. She gave up her job to look after her mum - she gets paid for some of her caring hours, but not for all of them. ""I was only ever going to be doing [the paid caring role] temporarily but it's really hard to step away from it."" She said any potential employer would have to understand her need to take phone calls at work and sometimes vary her schedule. ""If I was working nine-to-five, Monday to Friday - like my sister does - if we're all going to be doing that, it's going to be a nightmare to be honest."" ""Carers find it extremely stressful having to work and care at the same time,"" said Claire Morgan, director of Carers Wales. ""That can lead to anxiety and depression so we really want to encourage employers to be sympathetic to the carers in their workforce. ""The sorts of things they can do is encourage people to take flexible working, to encourage their line managers to be sympathetic to the needs of carers and also encourage carers within their workforce to speak to each other and support each other."" Flexibility Helen Walbey, managing director of Recycle Scooters in Aberdare, employs three people and said it could be easier for small businesses to be more flexible and carer-friendly. ""There are reasonable adjustments to ensure staff can continue to be in work - for example, staff can start later and take a shorter lunch break or finish later,"" she said. ""Small business owners don't have a lot of time though - so they need simple, easy to understand information about the best way to support carers. ""They don't have time to wade through a huge sea of information."" Huw Irranca-Davies, minister for children, older people and social care, said he would encourage all organisations to become members of the hub which will give expert guidance and legal advice on setting up carer-friendly employment policies.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Lana Del Rey: Israel gig 'not a political statement',"The singer has been criticised since announcing her debut performance at the Meteor Festival, with some people calling it a ""serious mistake"". ""I would like to remind you that performing in Tel Aviv is not a political statement or a commitment to the politics there,"" she wrote. ""I'm doing the best I can and my intentions are better than most."" Lana cancelled a show in Israel in 2014 as a result of the war that summer between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Despite her reference to the city of Tel Aviv, the Meteor festival is scheduled to take place at Kibbutz Lehavot Habashan in the Upper Galilee region. ""We don't always agree with the politics of the places we play within or even our own country,"" she added. ""But we are musicians and we've dedicated our lives to being on the road."" Some people aren't satisfied with Lana's stance, and have compared her performing in Israel to performing in South Africa during the apartheid era. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (Pacbi) urged the singer to ""reconsider"". ""Thousands of artists from around the world have pledged not to perform in Israel until it respects the human rights of Palestinians."" Pacbi is part of the Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) movement, which campaigns for a complete boycott of Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. Israel says that BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. Some called for Lana to ""take a stand against oppressors"". However others backed her decision. Celebrities like Lorde and Radiohead have previously faced backlashes for performing in Israel. Lorde cancelled a gig in December after she received an open letter from fans arguing that her concert would show support for Israel's occupation since 1967 of the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land that Palestinians claim for a future state. ""Thank u for educating me, I am learning all the time too,"" she tweeted. Radiohead were asked to call off their show in July 2017 as part of a cultural boycott led by BDS, but lead singer Thom Yorke tweeted: ""Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government"". He added: ""We've played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Wisbech burnt body: Men jailed for killing Mindaugas Arlauskas,"Mindaugas Arlauskas, 28, was found by a passer-by in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire on 9 May. Donatas Umbrasas, 27, of Wisbech, pleaded guilty to murder in June and was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court to a minimum term of 15 years. Tomas Lazdauskas, 24, also of Wisbech, was given 10 years for manslaughter. Judge David Farrell QC said: ""Minda was brutally beaten to death with a combination of punches, kicks, possibly stamping, but certainly the use of a metal bar, a garden chair and a children's toy. ""It was a prolonged and persistent attack using serious violence."" Addressing the two men, he said: ""The two of you, working together, wheeled the body away on his own bicycle and then dumped it in the street. ""You, Umbrasas, set fire to it to destroy evidence of what had happened."" The court heard the case stemmed from the ""complicated"" love life of Lazdauskas, who wanted to divorce his wife and begin a relationship with a woman that the victim also had feelings for. Lazdauskas also ""encouraged"" the victim to ""become friendly"" with his wife, possibly to give him grounds for divorce. On the day of the killing, Lazdauskas told his wife he would invite Mr Arlauskas to their house in Milner Road, where he was drinking excessively with Umbrasas, ""to hit him a little bit"". Umbrasas, of Albany Road, then attacked Mr Arlauskas in the back garden, leaving him dying or dead before the pair hatched a plan to get rid of the body. The court heard Umbrasas - a Lithuanian national, like his victim - was a hard-working factory worker who lived with his mother and had no previous convictions. It ""beggared belief"" why he acted the way he did, the court was told. Lazdauskas had come to the UK for a job as a a field worker in February and had one conviction for dishonesty in Lithuania. He admitted manslaughter and was acquitted of murder by a jury in November. He was told he must serve two-thirds of his sentence before being released on licence.

'Fewer cars' as London congestion charge zone cut back,"TfL said in the first three months of the year there was also a negligible impact on air quality and minimal change in traffic speeds in the area. The Green Party's Darren Johnson said an 8% rise in traffic and slower travel times was ""nothing to celebrate"". London mayor Boris Johnson scrapped the zone following a public consultation. 'Purely political' The Western Extension Zone (WEZ) was introduced in 2007 by the former Labour mayor Ken Livingstone, despite people living in the zone voting against the proposal. Drivers were charged Â£8-a-day but the fee was scrapped on Christmas Day 2010. Campaigners who called for an end to the charge claimed it was never justified and was for ""purely political reasons"". Observations in the first 12 weeks of 2011 showed traffic entering the former zone during charging hours increased by 8% compared with the same period in 2010, TfL said. TfL had forecast an increase of between 8-15%. 'Impact of roadworks' Traffic driving within the former zone increased by an estimated 6%, which was at the lower end of the forecast of 6-12%. At 3% slower, the change in average traffic speeds were ""significantly"" lower than the predicted reduction of 6-12%, the figures showed. The TfL study showed there was not a been a ""discernable impact"" on air quality by removing the WEZ and concentrations of nitrogen dioxide had fallen, both inside and outside the area. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: ""I've always believed that West Londoners never wanted the extension of the congestion charge and had it foisted upon them. ""I am glad I gave the people a say and thrilled that the initial results suggest there has been no significant downside in removing the WEZ."" But Green Party London Assembly member Darren Johnson said particulate pollution has been bad across the whole of central London this year and the area covered by the western extension zone was ""no exception"". He said: ""It is too early to say what the long term impact will be as the major roadworks and lane restrictions on Cromwell Road have reduced local traffic since last October.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Charity helps drug addicts set up their own businesses,"By Chris DeardenBBC News Some residents at Penrhyn House - a rehabilitation centre in Bangor - have set up a carpet cleaning business while others are making jams and chutneys or cosmetics from beeswax. Organisers of the initiative said it helped to give people the confidence to stop using drugs. They now want to expand the service. The centre, based in an old youth hostel, is run by the charity North Wales Recovery Communities, it opened in May 2015 and has treated between 700 and 800 people. It is now helping some people stop taking drugs by giving them support and advice to set up their own businesses. James Deakin, manager of Penrhyn House, said it was giving people a focus and also experience in the world of work. ""It's sometimes difficult as a recovering drug addict to get meaningful employment,"" he said. ""Gaps in your work record - and sometimes a criminal record - can all make it difficult to convince employers to take you on. ""If people can move on from here with something positive on their CV, they stand a better chance of getting and keeping a job. Quite a few have gone on to paid employment. ""We've got people who've qualified as beekeepers and others making cosmetics from the beeswax. ""The residents are growing organic fruit and vegetables and have set up deals with two local restaurants to supply them. ""The carpet cleaning business has only been going for 12 weeks, but we've already got one resident working on it full time."" Former addict Steph Jones, from Bangor, said: ""We've been making cards and slate artworks and we've taken them to shows to sell. ""Going out there and selling stuff is quite an experience. It gives you a huge lift when someone wants to buy your work. ""You're learning for the future. Some people come here and they've got no self confidence - they think they can't do things, they've been told their whole life that they can't, that they're rubbish.

Covid in Scotland: 'Majority' of criminal trials on hold for lockdown,"Until the end of February only the ""most serious"" trials will proceed, to reduce the number of people needed to attend court during the pandemic. The courts service said this would cut the overall number of criminal trials taking place in lockdown by 75%. Non-criminal court business such as civil and family cases are to continue via video links and virtual hearings. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was ""acutely aware"" of the impact of delays on victims, witnesses and the accused, but said ""all parts of society must step up our efforts to help safeguard health"". There have been warnings that a backlog of trials, already building before the pandemic, could now take up to a decade to clear. The courts system has brought in a series of innovations to continue trials during the pandemic, with socially-distanced juries sitting in cinemas and more use of digital technology. All courts are to remain open during the current lockdown, but the majority of trials are to be postponed due to concerns over a surge in infections. Serious allegations Only trials concerning serious allegations such as sexual offences and those involving domestic abuse and children will proceed, alongside those where the accused is already in custody. The bulk of non-custody trials and procedural hearings will be adjourned, although ""urgent"" matters can still be fast-tracked. The courts service said the ""current planning assumption"" was that this would continue until 28 February, although this will be kept under review. Cases which do not involve a jury - such as criminal appeals and civil cases in the Sheriff Court and Court of Session - will continue to be conducted remotely. Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said the news would be a ""body blow to crime victims and witnesses"", saying they would be ""left in limbo"". He added: ""The SNP have had 10 months to deal with this and they must now work with lawyers, prosecutors, court staff and the judiciary to alleviate the impact of these postponements and find practical and safe ways to ease the logjam. ""It is also vital these postponed cases cannot be quietly abandoned. Doing so would be a betrayal of victims and risk undermining public faith in the justice system."" Mr Yousaf said the move was justified if it would help reduce the number of people who have to attend court in person, pointing to ""very concerning rates of infection, hospitalisation and death"" due to Covid-19. However said the courts were ""logistically and operationally in a much better position than in the spring when a full shutdown of criminal trials was needed"". He said: ""The Scottish government will continue to work with justice organisations and victims representatives in the weeks and months ahead, to consider all options to respond to the inevitable increase in cases awaiting trial, as well as the wider impact of the on-going public health challenges across the justice system.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tulsa shooting: Family of man killed by police call for protests,"Authorities are investigating the death of Terence Crutcher, 40, who had his hands in the air when he was shot next to his car, relatives say. Police footage shows Mr Crutcher walking away from officers, his hands in the air, before he is shot. An officer is heard on a recording from a police helicopter calling him ""a big dude"" who was ""probably on something"". ""The big bad dude was my twin brother,"" his twin sister, Tiffany, told reporters. ""That big bad dude was a father. That big bad dude was a son. That big bad dude was enrolled at Tulsa Community College, just wanting to make us proud. ""That big bad dude loved God. That big bad dude was at church singing with all of his flaws, every week. That big bad dude, that's who he was.'' She went on to ask that people turn out to demonstrate. ""Just know that our voices will be heard,"" she said. ""The video will speak for itself. Let's protest. ""Let's do what we have to do, but let's just make sure that we do it peacefully, to respect the culture of (the Crutcher family)."" In another video filmed inside a police car, Mr Crutcher is seen walking away from officers and toward his vehicle with his hands up before he approaches the door on the driver's side. There he drops to the ground after a stun gun, and then a gun, are fired. He died later in hospital, police said. The video and the helicopter footage appear to back up his family's assertion that his hands were in the air at all times. Officers came across Mr Crutcher's stalled vehicle while they were en route to another call, reports say. A lawyer for Betty Shelby, the police officer who shot Mr Crutcher, said he had ignored officers' commands. Attorney Scott Wood told the Tulsa World newspaper that Mr Crutcher had repeatedly reached into his pockets, despite being told not to.

Missing N American couple in 'Taliban' video,"Caitlan Coleman, sat next to Joshua Boyle, appeals to ""my president, Barack Obama"" for help. The videos were emailed to Ms Coleman's family by an Afghan man months after she and Mr Boyle went missing. The families of the captive couple said they decided to make the videos public because of Bowe Bergdahl's release. They said their were disappointed the two were not freed as part of a prisoner swap deal that led to US soldier, Sgt Bergdahl, walking free at the weekend. ""It would be no more appropriate to have our government turn their backs on their citizens than to turn their backs on those who serve,"" Mr Boyle's father, Patrick Boyle, told Associated Press news agency. The man who sent the videos said he had Taliban ties but in 2012 the Taliban said it was not involved in their disappearance. ""We do not know about these two foreigners,"" spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said at the time. US officials investigating the couple's disappearance consider the videos authentic but said they offer few clues to their whereabouts or, indeed, whether they are still alive. Ms Coleman and the younger Mr Boyle were wed in 2011. Their families said they were well-intentioned but naive adventure seekers. The couple went missing in October 2012 during a months-long trip that included stops in Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Ms Coleman was pregnant and they were planning to return home before she gave birth. The videos were emailed last summer by a Afghan man who told the families he had Taliban ties, but they have not heard from him for several months. 'No Guantanamo link' In one recording, Ms Coleman appeals to the president. ""I would ask that my family and my government do everything that they can to bring my husband, child and I to safety and freedom,"" she says. Her child is not shown. Mr Boyle was previously married to Zaynab Khadr, sister of the only Canadian to be held at Guantanamo Bay, Omar Khadr, who was transferred to Canadian custody in 2012. But one US official told the Associated Press news agency investigators did not believe there was a link between the Khadrs and the kidnapping, calling it a ""horrible coincidence"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Farage: May 'wilfully deceiving' people over Brexit deal,"The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr the PM's proposed Brexit deal was a ""new European treaty"". In a tense interview, Mr Farage said he would demand his party became part of the government negotiating team if it was successful in the forthcoming European elections. Elections to the European Parliament take place on 23 May. Asked why he did not advocate a no-deal Brexit at the time of the EU referendum in 2016, Mr Farage said: ""Because it was obvious that we could do a free trade deal. ""The problem is the prime minister never asked for it, so we finished up in the mess that we're in,"" he said. ""She chose to go for this close and special partnership. Basically right from the start she was happy for us to be kept very close to the customs union. ""So where we are now, the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered is to leave on a WTO (World Trade Organization) deal."" The interview on the BBC programme also saw Mr Farage asked about past comments on NHS privatisation, climate change, gun control, immigration and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Responding angrily to the line of questioning, he said: ""This is absolutely ludicrous, I've never in my life seen a more ridiculous interview than this. ""You're in denial, the BBC is in denial, the Tory and Labour parties are in denial. ""I think you're all in for a bigger surprise on Thursday week [the EU elections] than you can even imagine."" Mr Farage's fellow guests on the Marr programme included Education Secretary Damian Hinds, who said the European Parliament elections would be seen by some people as a protest vote. ""For some people this is the ultimate protest vote opportunity. Actually, ironically this is, in a sense, for some people, this is the second referendum,"" he said. Mr Farage said he believed that if there was a second referendum, the campaign to leave the EU would win by a bigger margin. He said he was ""mentally preparing myself for one"", adding: ""I'm thinking we may well have it forced upon us."" Lib Dem deputy leader and People's Vote supporter Jo Swinson said Mr Farage had refused to ""own up to well-documented and abhorrent views on NHS privatisation, his admiration for Vladimir Putin and his denial of the facts about climate change"". She said: ""Despite his claims to the contrary, everyone remembers that he promised in 2016 that there would be an amazing cost-free Brexit deal available to Britain if we voted to leave the EU. ""To say today that he always advocated 'no deal' is a mark of just how shameless he is, and how little he cares for the jobs and livelihoods of the people of this country.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Israel eases restrictions following vaccine success,"From Sunday, shops, libraries and museums can open but social distancing and masks are still required. The health ministry says it is the first stage of returning to normal life. Israel has the highest vaccination rate in the world. More than 49% of people have received at least one dose. The country entered its third lockdown on 27 December after a resurgence of the virus. Under the easing measures, people are now able to enter shopping malls and tourist attractions such as zoos. A number of other facilities are now able to reopen including gyms, hotels and synagogues. However they require a ""green passport"", a certificate that can only be obtained once you have been vaccinated. A small number of people who have recovered from the virus and are not currently eligible for the vaccine are also able to obtain the certificate. The passport, which is contained in an app, is issued by the health ministry and will be valid for six months, one week after the second dose. Crowds are now allowed back at concerts and sporting events have reopened at 75% capacity but they have a cap of no more than 300 people inside and 500 outside. Despite the easing of restrictions, Israel's airport will remain closed for another two weeks. On Saturday, the health ministry said studies revealed the risk of illness from the virus has dropped 95.8% among people who have had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. It also found that the vaccine was 98% effective in preventing fever or breathing problems. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he expects 95% of Israelis over 50 to be vaccinated over the next two weeks. Earlier this week, the Gaza Strip received its first doses of the vaccine after Israel approved the transfer through its border. The shipment included 2,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine which will be used on patients who have had organ transplants and those with kidney failure, an official told Reuters news agency. It comes as the Palestinian Health Ministry struck a deal with Israel's Health Ministry to vaccinate 100,000 Palestinians who work in the country. It's thought about five million Palestinians so far are waiting for their vaccines.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Henry Moore statue: Minister's concerns over sale plan,"Len TinglePolitical editor, Yorkshire Now her planned sale is provoking a national outcry and the lady is certainly not going quietly. This week there was even a debate in Parliament and Culture Minister Ed Vaisey made it very clear he is not happy about the move. 'Old Flo' is really the Henry Moore masterpiece Draped Seated Woman which the West Yorkshire sculptor made as a tribute to the ordeal suffered by Londoners as they huddled in shelters during the lethal air raids of World War II. Moore had been living and working in the East End himself through the Blitz so he thought the figure should be seen by the people who shared that experience. In 1962 he sold the 1.6 tonne bronze to the City of London County Council at the knock-down price of Â£7,500 and 'Old Flo' was put on display on an East London council housing estate. In 1999, tormented by vandalism, she temporarily moved to the tranquillity of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, but it was always assumed a safer permanent public home would be found for her back in East London. Â£20m temptation That was until earlier this year when Lutfur Rahman, the directly-elected mayor of Tower Hamlets, the modern day council for the area, announced he wanted to sell the bronze for an estimated Â£20m to boost the borough's cash-strapped budget. He claims the council cannot afford to transport, site and insure the masterpiece, so it would be better to auction it off to the highest bidder. However, even his own local councillors and the Tower Hamlets MP say he is wrong. They worry it could finish up in a foreign collection and the both the Museum of London and a University College have offered to provide a permanent home. In the end a legal challenge over its ownership could end the argument. Moore sold the work to the old City of London County Council. It was replaced by the Greater London Council, which itself was dissolved in the 1980s. So is the fact that its original display site was on land now owned by the modern Borough of Tower Hamlets enough to give its mayor the right to sell it off? Vaisey's dilemma For the first time Culture Minister Ed Vaisey has stepped in saying any auction cannot go ahead until that dispute is settled. In this week's parliamentary debate called to discuss the future of the Moore masterpiece he revealed he had taken the unusual step of directly explaining his view to Christie's, the auctioneers commissioned to start the sale process. The minister admits the final decision on the statue's future is in the hands of its legal owners and government has little power to intervene. But now the sale has been put on hold until that ownership dispute has been resolved it is looking as though 'Old Flo' will be staying in her temporary country home in West Yorkshire for some time to come.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The Indian tribe that gave up hunting to save forests,"At one time, 76-year-old Chaiyievi Zhiinyii was a skilled hunter. But he stopped hunting in 2001. The Angami tribe gave up what was an important source of livelihood some 20 years ago in order to create a more stable ecosystem for future generations. For centuries, many in the remote, hilly village of Khonoma spent the majority of their time hunting. They killed animals for sustenance but also because it was a tradition and a way of life. It all began in 1993 when some tribespeople began a campaign to stop hunting. They were spurred to act after they discovered that the grey-bellied Tragopans, a type of pheasant, was an endangered species. The region is home to a few hundred of the birds but they were often killed for their meat. As a result of the campaign by some people in the tribe, the village council decided to cordon off about 20 sq km, where they would not allow hunting. In 1998 this area became the Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary. In the years since the council has banned all forms of hunting, logging, jungle burning as well as any kind of commercial operation that exploits natural resources and the forests that surround the village. According to local tradition, members of the tribe are encouraged to keep the heads of hunted animals inside their homes. While most of the hunters have given up their rifles, some still display the heads of the animals they had killed. Muzzle-loading guns and a range of traps are among the most widely used hunting equipment in Nagaland. For many hunters, these weapons embodied skill as well as courage. They represented a sacred practice that was passed down the from one generation to another. The community is also fond of folk music, which its members practice and often perform in front of the village council or during celebrations. Khonoma village boasts a wide range of plant species, which include medicinal varieties as well as wild vegetables. The tribe's ecological sensitivity extends to their agricultural practices as well. They all farm for a living but they do not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides. They also practice an elaborate system of terraced farming and irrigation for higher yields. ""We don't want our folklore to become meaningless to our future generations as it has names of so many wild species of birds, plants, animals and wild flowers,"" said Mr Khriekhoto Mor, chairman of the Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary. ""Our life, tradition and culture are very much dependent on nature and its habitats and we are determined to protect them. "" Correction: This article has been amended to reflect that the name of the tribe is Angami, and not Khonoma. Sayan Hazra is a photographer based in India.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Rio 2016: 'Welcome to Hell' warn police,"By BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why Along with the relatives carrying flowers and taxi drivers waiting with name boards there were lines of off-duty police with banners that had a far more ominous message: ""Welcome to Hell"". ""Police and firefighters don't get paid,"" the banners, in English and Portuguese, went on. ""Whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe"". Photos of the protest have been widely shared on social media and in the Brazilian press. The image above was posted on the photo sharing site Imgur, where it was viewed more than three million times in less than a day. Elsewhere in the city police staged other demonstrations against the late payment of salaries and a lack of basic necessities like car fuel and toilet paper. Around 300 police officers dressed in black stood on the steps of the Rio de Janeiro state assembly. One banner read ""The police's priority is the people, the government's priority is the Olympics"". A spokesman for the Rio police force said the situation was dire. ""We are in a meltdown,"" he said. The message was echoed by Francisco Dornelles, the acting governor of Rio de Janeiro, who told the Brazilian newspaper O Globo that the state was still waiting on the promised $860 million payout from the federal government ahead of the start of the games. He added that without the cash injection, police patrols may be have to be halted due to the lack of funds for basics like car fuel. The police protests are one more symptom of the political and economic woes which have engulfed Brazil and which threaten to overshadow the Olympic Games which Rio is preparing to host in August. Brazil's Senate suspended the country's President Dilma Rousseff, and then began impeachment proceedings against her over accusations that she manipulated the government budget ahead of her 2014 re-election campaign. On the economic front the picture isn't much prettier. By the first quarter of 2016, government figures showed that Brazil was experiencing its worst recession in 25 years. The Gross Domestic Product of the country shrank 5.4% in comparison with the same period last year. Meanwhile unemployment between February and April of this year grew to 11.2% from 9.5%. Average monthly wages also fell to just 1,962 Brazilian reais ($552). If that wasn't enough the Olympic organising committee is dealing with the news that two more famous sportsmen - including golf world number one Jason Day - have withdrawn from the games because of fears about the Zika virus. However, the CEO of the games has said that concerns about the virus affecting the Olympics have been ""blown out of the proportion.""

Oxford Covered Market rent hike defended,"A petition to ""Save The Oxford Covered Market"" has gathered more than 8,000 signatures since it started in March. The council said rents were currently ""very low"" considering the market's central location, but that cuts in government grants also played a part. The rent rise was due to have taken effect in March but has been delayed as some traders go through arbitration. There are more than 50 independent shops in the Covered Market, with an average rent of Â£16,800 per year (Â£320 per week). Florist Sandy Griffiths said she would have to close her business after 30 years. She added: ""It's that serious... I've cut the staff down to the quick. ""There's only so far you can go so I don't think there'll be a place for me in the city centre. ""The market's full of traders who can't afford to trade in the city centre, such as florists, bakers, butchers, and this market was designed to do that."" 'Jewel in crown' Shoe shop owner Vicky Alder said the rent rise would mean ""dramatic"" changes to her income. She added: ""This is an ideal opportunity to have diverse businesses that cannot afford to go out on the high street because you're working on lower margins."" Colin Cook, board member for city development, said the market was the ""jewel in the crown"" of Oxford and would continue to get investment. But he added: ""We are facing severe cuts in our government grants, 25% in the last three or four years. ""We have to look to our discretionary work and have reduced work that we try to do protecting some of the most vulnerable in this city. ""We have to use the money... to the best ability that we can to make sure that we provide the services that people of Oxford expect."" Retail consultant Keith Slater confirmed market space was cheaper than the rest of the city. He added: ""Oxford is a very high retail rental area [and] is short of shops... so if you compare [the rents] with other places in Oxford it's cheaper, but if you compare it with other cities it's actually quite expensive.""

Dog microchipping to be compulsory in Wales by 2015,"The move is seen as a way to improve animal welfare and develop responsible dog ownership by helping identify strays. It is estimated 190,000 dogs will need to be microchipped before the March 2015 deadline. Nearly 60% of dogs in Wales have chips, which have coded owners' details. In England, compulsory microchipping will not come into force until April 2016. Some charities offer the procedure for free but it costs about Â£20-Â£30 at a private veterinary clinic. It involves inserting a sterile chip the size of a grain of rice between a dog's shoulder blades. The Welsh minister for Natural Resources Alun Davies said it was increasingly important to have a method of tracing dogs back to their owners. ""Dog owners already have a duty of care under the Animal Welfare Act but it can be difficult to ensure that this duty is being met without a reliable form of identification,"" he said. 'Overwhelming support' ""By microchipping all dogs in Wales we can formalise the relationship between an owner and pet and ensure an increased level of accountability."" Mr Davies said public consultation had shown there is ""overwhelming support"" for the plans. According to the Dogs Trust - which has a re-homing centre in Bridgend - the total number of stray dogs in Wales increased from 9,482 in 2011 to 10,230 in 2012. The charity plans to offer free microchipping to dog owners in Wales before the regulations come in. 'Dog welfare' The trust's chief executive officer, Clarissa Baldwin, said: ""Microchipping involves a minimal one-off cost, but the benefits last a life-time. ""The reality is that no matter how responsible an owner you are there is a chance your dog could get lost or stolen - micro-chipping is the most effective way to assist in a lost dog being returned to its owner."" The British Veterinary Association's (BVA) Welsh branch secretary, Bob Stevenson, said: ""This is fantastic news for dog welfare in Wales. ""Microchipping provides veterinary practices, charities, and dog wardens with the ability to reunite lost and stray dogs quickly and safely with their owners. ""It is important to remember that microchips are only as useful as the information held on the database and we must all work together with the Welsh government to ensure that dog owners understand the importance of keeping their information up to date.""

Iran nuclear deal: Rouhani says West has no right to make changes,"The US and French leaders announced on Tuesday that they were working on a ""new deal"" that would expand and extend the terms of the 2015 accord. But Mr Rouhani said they had no ""right"" to renegotiate a seven-party agreement. He also dismissed US President Donald Trump as a ""tradesman"" not qualified to comment on global treaties. ""You don't have any background in politics,"" he said. ""You don't have any background in law. You don't have any background on international treaties."" Mr Trump has said the US will reimpose sanctions on Iran suspended under the deal on 12 May unless Congress and European powers fix its ""disastrous flaws"". The five other parties to the accord - France, the UK, Germany, China and Russia - see it as the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and want Mr Trump to continue waiving the sanctions while they try to address his concerns. Before holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump called the deal ""insane"" and left it unclear what would happen next month. He also warned Iranian leaders that they would ""have bigger problems than they have ever had before"" if they restarted their nuclear programme. Afterwards, Mr Macron told a joint news conference that the deal was ""not sufficient"" but gave Western powers some control over Iranian nuclear activities. ""We therefore wish, from now on, to work on a new deal with Iran,"" he said. Based on their discussions, Mr Macron added, it would ""need to cover four topics"": Mr Trump said: ""I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger maybe deal, maybe not deal. We're going to find out, but we'll know fairly soon."" It was not clear whether Iran would have any say on the agreement being worked on by US and European officials, but its president poured scorn on Mr Macron's proposals in a televised speech in the city of Tabriz on Wednesday. ""Together with a leader of a European country [the Americans] say: 'We want to decide on an agreement reached by seven parties,'"" Mr Rouhani said. ""For what? With what right?"" Mr Rouhani also dismissed Mr Trump's ""empty"" threats to punish Iran if it restarted its nuclear programme in response to sanctions being reimposed. ""We will be taking very important steps regarding our nuclear technology,"" he added. ""Our activities will be very different than the past, but will be peaceful."" ""We are not thinking about developing nuclear weapons, nor will we think about it.""

Protected status for flapper skate 'nursery' off Skye,"The flapper skate ""nursery"" is in Skye's Inner Sound. The fish belong to the shark family and females can grow to 2.8m (9ft) in length. The MPA designation will come into force on 17 March and prohibit some activities such as fishing, diving and construction. Scotland's nature agency, NatureScot, said the Skye habitat was of ""national importance for the species"". Deputy director, Eileen Stuart, said: ""This is great news for flapper skate, an amazing species that is listed as critically endangered - making the population we have on the west coast of Scotland particularly important for their conservation."" In Scotland, flapper skate are found on the west coast and in Orkney and Shetland. They take more than 10 years to reach sexual maturity and produce low numbers of offspring, meaning populations recover slowly from any negative impact such as habitat loss. The adult fish hunt for prawns, other skate and small sharks in deep water. The Skye MPA designation will initially be in place for 12 months. The Scottish government said any proposals to extend the designation for longer would be subject to a ""full stakeholder engagement process, public consultation and impact assessments"". Our Seas Coalition, which campaigns for sustainable fishing that benefits people and the environment, said while the designation was welcome in protecting an endangered fish it had some concerns. The alliance said creel fishing, which it said ""impacts a much smaller area of seabed than trawling"", would be affected by the temporary MPA, while trawling would still be allowed in adjacent areas of ""sensitive seabed habitats"". A spokeswoman said: ""It makes sense for there to be preferential access for the most sustainable fishing methods. ""We think that environmental recovery of our seas can go hand in hand with sustainable fisheries."" Fisheries management of the Inner Sound is the subject of a legal dispute between the Scottish government and creel fishermen, who want a pilot project to be run which would see no trawling and dredging in some inshore areas. MPAs cover others areas of sea off Scotland's coast. The designation aims to protect habitats from marine industry projects and some types of fishing. Europe's largest MPA covers an area of deep sea off the Western Isles. The West of Scotland MPA involves an area of more than 38,610 sq miles (100,000 sq km) in the north-east Atlantic. Coral reefs and deep-sea sharks are among the wildlife found at depths of 2,500m (8,202ft).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How many migrant children cross the English Channel?,"By William McLennanBBC News More than 7,400 people have stepped into small boats and navigated one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world to reach the south coast of England in 2020. At least six people are now thought to have died in that time, including the two children on Tuesday. A third child is missing. An inspection of a holding facility at the Port of Dover last month found at least 320 children arrived between the start of June and the end of August - about 10% of all those who crossed the Channel in that time. Another 2,500 people have since reached the UK, but the number of children among them remains unclear. The Home Office has consistently refused to confirm the number of children among those making the crossing. It claims there are ""safeguarding concerns"" which prevent it from identifying children and it can be difficult to confirm the ages of adolescents. Charity Kent Refugee Action Network (KRAN), which supports child asylum seekers arriving in the county, said the government ""deliberately cloak the numbers of children making the lethal journey across the Channel because they know there would be a public outcry"". While the total number of children making the crossing remains unknown, a sharp rise in those arriving without their families caused a crisis for Kent County Council (KCC) this summer. It had taken most of the unaccompanied child asylum-seekers arriving at Dover into its care, but it reached capacity in August amid rising numbers. More than 400 lone child migrants had arrived in Kent in the first eight months of 2020, but this is likely to be just a fraction of the total number of children reaching the UK in small boats. According to documents reviewed by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, unaccompanied-asylum seeking children made up just 20% of the total number of under-18s arriving in Dover between June and August. Since KCC reached capacity, lone children have been held for longer while social services placements are found in other counties, the inspectorate found. In one case, a 15-year-old boy was held for 66 hours. Clare Mosely, of Care4Calais, said that at any one time about 20% of would-be asylum seekers camped in Calais were unaccompanied boys. On a visit to makeshift camps in Dunkirk earlier this week, the charity found about 20 families with roughly 40 children waiting to attempt a crossing, she said. Bridget Chapman, of KRAN, said the Home Office was hiding ""behind a wall of secrecy"" by not revealing the number of children involved. ""What we are talking about here is desperate people including many children. They deserve humanity and respect, not a terrible death in the cold waters of the English Channel.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat","Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes. And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse. As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing. A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others. ""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me. ""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks. ""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit."" Doomsday scene The key phrase is ""stress tested"". The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock. The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled. It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning. It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. Negative It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines. If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released. Investment could rise markedly, he has argued. Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ian Paisley challenges BBC over Maldives 'wrongdoing' evidence,"He was speaking for the first time since a BBC Spotlight programme. It alleged the government minister paid for part of the trip. ""If the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the BBC has to do is to submit evidence to the Parliamentary Commissioner,"" he said. ""The independent authority can examine on all of those matters and make their own ruling. ""That's the only comment I can make."" New rules at Westminster mean that MPs' names are no longer routinely published if they are the subject of an investigation. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards only publishes information about individual investigations when they have ended. Sinn FÃ©in, the Alliance Party, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists have all referred the matter to the standards commissioner. ""I am always happy to talk at length to the BBC about all the matters and questions you may have,"" said Mr Paisley. ""I would love to be able to give you a running commentary but I am not able."" When asked if the North Antrim MP's constituents deserved a fuller explanation, Mr Paisley said: ""Don't worry about my constituents; my constituents and me have a very good and sound relationship."" The DUP MP was previously suspended from Parliament in 2018 for 30 sitting days after he failed to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. What allegations have been made? The BBC Spotlight programme alleged that Mohamed Shainee, a Maldivian government minister, paid for a luxury holiday taken by Mr Paisley and his family. It reported the company that owned the resort where the family stayed said that Mr Shainee requested the accommodation and settled the payment. It came eight months after North Antrim MP Mr Paisley visited the country and lobbied on its government's behalf. Last December, a BBC Spotlight programme revealed that he did not declare details of the 2016 holiday to Parliament authorities. Mr Paisley said at the time that he paid for part of the trip and a ""long-term friend"" who was unconnected to his work paid for the other part - BBC Spotlight has alleged that Mr Shainee was that friend. After the programme, the DUP said they noted ""the serious issues raised"". ""We require high standards from our elected representatives. Discipline is an internal party matter. We do not give a running commentary."" A BBC spokesperson said: ""This Spotlight investigation is now a matter of public record.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Billy Caldwell: Campaigner's company sells cannabis oil,"Charlotte Caldwell has been treating her severely epileptic son Billy, 12, with cannabis oil since 2016. His most recent supply was confiscated at Heathrow Airport. It was returned to him after doctors made clear it was a ""medical emergency"". Ms Caldwell, from County Tyrone, is the director of the company Billy's Bud. Incorporated in June 2017, it sells a type of cannabis oil - CBD - which is legal in the UK. Billy currently takes cannabis oil that contains the compound tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which is illegal in the UK due to its association with the psychoactive effects of cannabis. A post on the Billy's Bud Facebook page in December marked ""Attention!"" read: ""The CBD oil that we carry is 100% legal! It is from the hemp plant and does NOT contain THC! ""There are lots of people who have been confused about that and we want to set the record straight. We are NOT doing anything illegal! Please do your own research and feel free to ask questions."" A post in November, listed a 30ml/300mg bottle of oil on sale for Â£49.95. A spokesman for Ms Caldwell said profits from sales of the cannabis products - which include oils, capsules, powder, gummies, shots and honey sticks - were used to fund Billy's 24-7 healthcare needs, the Daily Telegraph reported. 'Clear understanding' In a statement to the BBC, the spokesman said that the products on sale could be purchased on the High Street, ""although those available on Billy's Bud are of the highest possible quality"". ""Cannabis oil medication with the higher concentration of THC will only be available after assessment of individuals by the government's expert panel of clinicians currently being set up, and not through retail channels in the UK,"" he said. ""It is vital that there is a clear understanding of the difference. It would take vast volumes of cannabis oil with THC to have any psychoactive effect."" The spokesman added that anybody who is critical of Ms Caldwell ""legitimately doing whatever she can to ensure Billy's wellbeing in later life"" should take ""a long, hard look at themselves"". Billy Caldwell was taken to hospital last week in what his mother said was a life-threatening condition. It followed the confiscation at Heathrow of the cannabis oil which Ms Caldwell had been attempting to bring into the UK from Canada. Billy had been suffering as many as 100 seizures a day before being prescribed the cannabis oil containing THCA by a doctor in Northern Ireland. His mother said he had been free of seizures for about 300 days due to the treatment, but the Home Office recently ordered the doctor to stop prescribing the oil. Following his admission to hospital, the Home Office granted a 20-day licence for the use of the banned substance. On Tuesday, the home secretary said the use of medicinal cannabis was to be reviewed, which could lead to more prescriptions of drugs made from the plant.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Calls for more openness over enterprise zone jobs,"More than 5,100 jobs have been created or safeguarded over two years but Plaid Cymru has complained that the public has a ""right to know more"". The Information Commissioner is dealing with a complaint that ministers have refused to release statistics. A Welsh government spokesman has said it was ""aware"" of the investigation. The complaint was made by Plaid who want details of how many jobs have been created in each of Wales' seven enterprise zones. Ministers launched the first enterprise zones in 2011 in an effort to make the Welsh economy more competitive. The zones bring together particular types of industry and offer businesses moving into them certain incentives and opportunities. The seven zones are: Government figures show the enterprise zones created and safeguarded a total of 5,142 jobs between April 2012 and March 2014. These included 2,159 new jobs across 188 businesses. 'Preventing scrutiny' Last October, First Minister Carwyn Jones said a further 6,500 jobs are in the pipeline. But there is no breakdown for individual zones despite Plaid submitting a Freedom of Information request for those details earlier this year. Plaid's shadow minister for the economy and enterprise Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""It appears the Welsh government displays openness when it suits them but when they are questioned about something which may be difficult they shut up shop and refuse to disclose information, preventing scrutiny. ""Plaid Cymru supports the development of enterprise zones and wants them to a success in creating jobs across Wales. ""But after more than two years people have a right to know more about the success of a scheme which involves spending public money."" Anglesey AM Mr ap Iorwerth said there may be issues around the pace of development in the different enterprise zones but all the Welsh government needed to do was ensure the information included a ""clear caveat"" detailing the differences between each of them. A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office said: ""We have received a freedom of information complaint relating to this matter. ""We are currently looking into the details before deciding what further action, if any, is required."" The spokesperson for Welsh government said it was aware of the investigation and will ""respond to the Information Commissioner's inquiries"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tintin and the vanishing murals: Brussels races to save art,"By Daniel CurtisBBC News, Brussels In the early 1920s HergÃ©, then a 15-year-old Georges Remi, was a scout and student at Institut St Boniface, in the Ixelles area of Brussels. He adorned the walls of the old scout HQ with lovingly rendered art showing scouts and Native American Indians, as well as a map of Belgium. But now the small garage is in disuse, the walls are in a poor state and many of his drawings have crumbled away. Tintin's popularity is enduring. The intrepid reporter is a symbol of Belgian culture and helped to inspire an entire art form in the early days of the comic book. Although Tintin was created in the 1920s, it was during his 1940s run in the Belgian newspaper Le Soir that he really took off. But Le Soir's very existence hinged on its support for the Nazi regime. Accusations of being a Nazi sympathiser have dogged HergÃ© ever since. Read more about Tintin: Yet Tintin is still adored the world over. He even got the Hollywood treatment, with a in 2011 film by Steven Spielberg. For that reason, according to historian and archivist Thierry Scaillet from the Catholic University of Louvain, it's essential to preserve this ""first graphical trace of HergÃ©"". ""It's the only place we know of that still exists where HergÃ© decorated the walls,"" he says. ""There were other frescoes by him in the same school but those walls disappeared after World War Two. ""It's the oldest work by HergÃ© that we know of,"" Mr Scaillet told the BBC. He sees a clear link between those formative years as a scout and the exploits HergÃ© would later create for Tintin and his little white dog Snowy. Scouts like the young Georges Remi would often travel across Europe for up to three weeks, and those trips would cement in the young HergÃ© a ""taste for adventure and exploration"". Hence the boyish drawings of Native American Indians and the exotic adventures of Tintin. Local geographer and councillor Yves Rouyet is leading the charge to preserve and display these drawings - but it's not an easy process. ""No-one has done an estimation of what it would cost to restore them yet,"" he says, frustrated by a lack of movement. Much depends on events outside of Mr Rouyet's control. Local elections, which affect funding decisions in the Ixelles commune, take place in October. The school, which has for the first time begun to display these drawings, needs to agree to any changes on its own premises. But Mr Rouyet insists on the need to safeguard and display these drawings to the public and experts. ""It's important to preserve them. It's important for the history of humanity, for the history of comic books.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sarwar and Baillie out in Scottish Labour reshuffle,"Anas Sarwar, who lost to Richard Leonard in last year's leadership contest, has been replaced as health spokesperson by Monica Lennon. And Jackie Baillie has lost her role as the party's economy spokeswoman. Ms Baillie backed Mr Sarwar for the leadership, and is a close ally of former leader Kezia Dugdale. BBC Scotland understands she was sacked over the phone five minutes before Labour issued a statement confirming the changes. Mr Sarwar said he had earlier learned through Twitter that he was to be replaced. He was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber at the time. 'Best players' Both Ms Baillie and Ms Sarwar have criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the past, and have given their backing to Ms Dugdale in a row over the party withdrawing its funding for her defence in a defamation action brought by the Wings Over Scotland website. A supporter of Ms Baillie and Mr Sarwar claimed that their removal was based on ""factionalism ahead of competence"", adding: ""When you're in trouble you don't take your two best players off the pitch"". Scottish Labour's communications chief, Charlie Mann, also quit on Thursday after just five months in the job, saying he had ""decided the role is not for me"". Confirming his reshuffle, Mr Leonard - who will take on Ms Baillie's economy brief himself - thanked the outgoing members for their contribution. He added: ""My new shadow cabinet is a blend of skills and experience whose aim is to turn around Scottish Labour's electoral successes. ""By working together we will take Labour forward. It will give us the best possible chance to win again in Scotland."" 'Deeply disappointed' Mr Sarwar, who is Scottish Labour's only Asian MSP, has been campaigning against Islamophobia in the party after claiming he was the victim of racism during the leadership contest. In a statement, he said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to remove him, which he said he had learned of ""through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber"". Mr Sarwar added: ""For the sake of all the people who need a Labour government, I wish Richard Leonard and his shadow cabinet all the very best for the future. ""I will continue to serve my constituents tirelessly from the backbenches, campaigning for issues close to my heart including the battle against racism, prejudice and hatred."" Ms Baillie said: ""I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and will continue to be a strong advocate for my constituents - and Labour values. I wish Richard Leonard well for the future."" The Scottish Conservatives said the sacking of Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie showed that Labour is ""more divided than ever"", and claimed the party had ""deliberately removed their best performers from the front bench"" as part of a ""bewildering and ridiculous political fiasco"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pisa literacy survey: Finland loses top spot to Asians,"The tri-annual Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) survey of 15-year-olds ranked China's Shanghai region in first place. With Finland coming third, its education minister blamed a decline in reading, especially among boys. Pupils in Sweden and Ireland also performed worse than in 2006. The survey is run by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a body set up in 1961 to promote democracy and the market economy. Its 2009 survey covered both the OECD's own 33 member-states and 32 non-members including Russia and other former Soviet states. The Chinese regions of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao, but not China the country, were also included. Angel Gurria, the OECD's secretary-general, said the survey suggested that countries with similar levels of prosperity could produce very different results. ""This shows that an image of a world divided neatly into rich and well-educated countries and poor and badly educated countries is now out of date,"" he added. 'Still excellent' ""Since 2000, Finnish reading skills have decreased somewhat,"" Finnish Education Minister Henna Virkkunen acknowledged at a news conference. ""Ten years ago, one in five youths said they did not read for pleasure. Now that figure is one in three, and 50% for boys."" In the science category, Finland came in second, and only managed sixth place in maths. Jouni Vaelijaervi, director of the Institute of Educational Research, which administers the Pisa tests in Finland, said that, overall, Finland's results remained ""excellent"". Kaisa Alanne, head of Sakarinmaeen School in the eastern suburbs of Helsinki, told AFP news agency boys were not inherently less interested in reading than girls. ""It's more about finding the right way to activate them,"" she said. Bottom of the league The survey found that countries where students repeated years more often tended to have worse results overall, with the widest gaps between children from poor and better-off families. Making students repeat years was most common in Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Other than Finland, seven European countries performed significantly better in literacy than the OECD average: Belgium, Estonia, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Switzerland. Among those performing significantly worse than average were Italy, Spain, Austria and Greece. The worst-performing European state was Azerbaijan, coming second-last to Kyrgyzstan, while Russia lay in 43rd place, two places behind Turkey but ahead of Serbia.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lithuania country profile,"Not much more than a decade after it regained its independence during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, Lithuania was welcomed as a Nato member in late March 2004.

Spyware use in domestic violence 'escalating',"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under Â£50 and are easy to install, says the Digital-Trust. There are no official figures but ""digital abuse"" is often experienced by victims of domestic violence, it adds. People with abusive partners should also be wary of gadgets given to their children, the charity warns. ""Eighteen months ago I issued advice to domestic violence groups about fathers gifting smartphones or even allowing them to take them on access visits because it is so easy for abusers to use them as surveillance,"" said Jennifer Perry, chief executive of the newly formed Digital-Trust. ""I recommend children are given inexpensive pay as you go phones when visiting an abusive parent."" Ms Perry said incidents of digital abuse - ranging from surveillance to accessing voicemails, emails and cloud accounts, is escalating in the UK. In addition cheap surveillance devices - small GPS trackers, listening devices and cameras hidden inside books, lamps, plug sockets and carbon monoxide detectors, are freely available online despite some of them being illegal. ""If I have a domestic violence victim I assume there will be some type of digital abuse - it's not the exception, it's the assumption,"" she told the BBC. Ms Perry added that in her experience it is more likely to happen to female victims. ""I get a lot of criticism for saying it but I don't see this level or type of surveillance used against male victims,"" she added. ""I see men using it against women. It is rare to see a man targeted surveillance-wise by women."" Ms Perry began working in the field of e-crime in 2005. She said that often victims need very specific advice, which is not easily available. ""Safety advice is often done by topic but if you don't know what you're looking for it doesn't help,"" she added. ""We'll ask a series of questions that deal with the symptoms - are you being harassed by your partner? Is he showing up where you are? Has he had access to your house or your PC?"" Smartphone owners may have not set up their device themselves so may not know what has been installed on it, she added. ""The main thing I try to do is stop any form of data leaking. That's my number one objective,"" Ms Perry said. ""If you have a stalker and they get access to some information about you it's like the rush they get from a gambling addiction. ""You're taking about jealous or obsessive personalities. One stalker Googled a colleague of mine 40,000 times in a year.

Energy firm's Cheshire plans refused by councillors,"Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee voted 10 to 1 to reject IGas's plans for Ellesmere Port because of ""climate change"" concerns. Anti-fracking campaigner Matt Bryan said the company's plan was ""a prequel to full-scale fracking"". IGas denied this and said it would consider an appeal against the ruling. Protesters celebrated on Thursday after the council threw out the IGas plans which drew more than 1,400 objections. ""We've seen unprecedented opposition to this application,"" added Mr Bryan, who is also a Labour member of the council. IGas subsidiary Island Gas Ltd had applied to conduct flow tests on underground rock formations at a well site on Portside North in Ellesmere Port. It wanted to establish whether ""commercial hydrocarbon production"" could take place. The company told planning officers its plans ""do not involve any drilling or deepening of the existing well and does not involve hydraulic fracturing (fracking)"". But the cross-party planning committee rejected IGas's proposals saying they ""did not manage or adapt to the effects of climate change"". Analysis: Phil McCann, BBC Cheshire political reporter The controversial process of fracking involves pumping chemicals under high pressure into deep rock formations to release gas trapped inside. But IGas said it was not applying to frack at its Portside North site. Instead, it was applying to conduct tests which would have involved pumping acid at pressure into its boreholes - leading to accusations that the plans do represent a form of fracking. The council said the acid flow would not actually fracture the rock formations. As well as arguing these tests were dangerous enough on their own, campaigners said they represented a ""step towards fracking"", which would have necessitated another planning application. The council received 1,411 objections and a petition of 1,044 signatures against the plans, with two representations supporting them. A previous report by planning officers argued the proposals should be approved because they met planning policies and ""would not give rise to unacceptable adverse impacts on the natural environment and human health"". Island Gas Ltd was given planning permission in 2010 to drill exploratory boreholes at the Portside North site to search for coal bed methane. Spokesman John Blaymires said: ""Major employers in the area rely on gas for power and providing raw materials, so big employment is dependant upon local gas. ""We will consider whether or not an appeal is something that might be for the future."" Mr Bryan said he hoped IGas would ""respect local democracy and not appeal"". ""We hope that if it does appeal, the Secretary of State will not overturn this democratic decision.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Did Boris Johnson just announce an election without actually doing so?,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter He's always said that he really doesn't want to go to the country again. Downing Street is still absolutely adamant that is still the case, and again with the formality of the No 10 podium, he insisted it was not what he wanted to do. But he also made plain that there were no circumstances in which he would ask Brussels to delay our departure from the EU. And that means only one thing. Calling an election if, in his view, he needs to. When would he need to do that? Soon. In No 10's judgement, if MPs, including many of his former colleagues, defeat him this week and succeed in their move to make leaving the EU without a deal illegal, their best move is to call an election, and call one quickly, as soon as 14 October. The move is to focus the minds of Tory MPs tempted to vote against the government's position. Downing Street's upping the ante still further - if they are part of efforts to outlaw no deal, then they will be part of forcing a general election, and stand by to watch Boris Johnson's backers point the finger at them. But those rebels are confident of their numbers. And few of them so far seem likely to be moved by Downing Street's threats. No 10 knows therefore, they are likely to lose. Protest he might, but Boris Johnson is dangling the threat of this election knowing full well that it is one he is more likely than not to have to follow through. He would, of course, have to persuade Parliament to back an election, and Downing Street is ready to put a motion down to that precise effect. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may well be suspicious of the PM's motives, but has always said that he'd back a poll. So a leader who is yet to take his first Prime Minister's Questions at the despatch box may ask almost immediately for all of our judgements on whether he deserves to lead.

Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence,"It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities. It works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as in nightclubs and parks. The method has already been adopted by Western Cape in South Africa and Milwaukee in the USA. The man behind it, Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's School of Dentistry, said there was no reason it could not work anywhere in the world. One of the most significant breakthroughs was the sharing of information and joint action by police, councils and emergency departments to try to curb violence. Every time someone comes through accident and emergency with any sort of injury where alcohol is a contributory factor the police are informed. Late-night safety It is claimed that the approach has reduced hospital admissions for violence by 42% in Cardiff, relative to 13 similar cities in Wales and England. More than 100 hospitals across Wales and England have since copied Cardiff. ""It's very low tech and the basic requirements are that the police and local government and health meet from time to time in an organised way,"" Prof Shepherd said. ""That's not rocket science, so we think this is applicable widely, including poor countries [and] low and middle income countries. ""We would very much like to see this implemented in a country like Nigeria, Uganda or South American countries where there's a lot of violence. ""It's in the World Health Organisation-recommended approach but it's easier said than done."" Prof Shepherd, who was a surgeon at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, started his work in 1996 after realising that a great deal of violence which resulted in hospital treatment was not known to the police because victims did not report it. He also noticed trends in the types of facial injuries he was treating. Facial injuries Patients were being regularly admitted who had been glassed, and one early success was putting pressure on clubs and city centre pubs to adopt plastic glasses. The move brought about an immediate decline in facial injuries connected to alcohol. However, there were continuing problems with drink-related crimes in the city so Prof Shepherd and his violence and society research group continued their innovative approach. The research group's research into violence, alcohol and late-night safety was recognised with a Queen's Anniversary Prize for excellence in higher education in 2009. Amsterdam decided to adopt the approach after a delegation from the city, including the chief inspector of the police force, visited Cardiff last year. Hidde Toet, from the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute and who led the delegation, said after the visit: ""The Cardiff model provides us with an effective method to improve the way we share information and implement preventative measures by police and local government to effectively reduce violence.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rhino poaching: South Africa and Vietnam sign deal,"The price of rhino horn - used in traditional medicine in Asian countries - has soared. Rhino poaching is already banned under international conventions but figures show the number of rhinos killed in 2012 was nearly double the 2010 figure. South Africa is home to about 85% of Africa's estimated 25,000 rhinos. Conservation groups have welcomed the move as the first official co-operation between the two nations on the issue. The trade in rhino horn has been banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) since 1980. At least 618 rhinos have been poached in South Africa in 2012, nearly double the number of those killed in 2010, latest official figures show. Most of the killings took place in the world-famous Kruger National Park. Turning point? ""The continued slaughter is a cause for immense concern,"" South Africa's environmental minister, Edna Molewa said after signing the new agreement in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. ""We believe that this latest development at an international level is crucial for South Africa to effectively deal with the current scourge of poaching, and with the illegal hunting largely driven by the international demand for the rhino horn."" Buyers in Vietnam are willing to pay a high prize for the commodity, believed to help reduce toxins in the body, treat fever and even cure cancer. The black market price of rhino horn is now in the region of $65,000 (Â£40,000) per kg - more than gold. Since 2003, Vietnamese hunters are estimated to have paid more than $22m to hunt rhinos in South Africa, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The new deal will focus on seven key areas of cooperation, including the protection of South Africa's biodiversity and compliance with internationally binding conventions like Cites. Each nation will appoint a co-ordinator to help implement the agreement, which will remain in force for five years. The deal could mark a turning point in efforts to protect rhinos because it represents the first official pact signed by both countries, Richard Thomas from the wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic told the BBC. ""Its implementation will of course be down to political will but the chances are much better if the orders come from high enough in the government,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Seren Hughes' parents concerned over epilepsy drugs changes,"Seren Hughes's father said Machynlleth Health Centre would no longer sign the repeat prescriptions for the medication that reduces her seizures. Hefin Hughes said it came as a shock as his daughter has had the medication from the surgery for six years. The health centre said the medication can only be prescribed by specialists. Powys Teaching Health Board said it sincerely hoped issues between the medical practice and the family can be resolved swiftly. Seren has had complex epilepsy since she was born. She used to have up to 100 seizures a day but, after surgery in 2016 and further research, specialists found that a cocktail of medication helped control the condition and her quality of life improved. But on Monday evening her parents had a call that has left them concerned. Mr Hughes said: ""It's a matter of life and death basically if she gets this medication or not - it helps to stabilise her epilepsy."" He said Seren has been taking a combination of four different drugs for six years with repeat prescriptions from the GP practice in Machynlleth. ""The only explanation we've had is that the surgery shouldn't be the ones who dispense it to us and that the medication isn't licensed,"" he said. ""They said we should get the medication from the local hospital. But when we asked which hospital - Bronglais in Aberystwyth, the Heath in Cardiff or Great Ormond Street - they said they didn't know. ""Why should a child with special needs and someone who's been through what Seren's been through face maybe having to go without her life-saving medication?"" In a statement, the surgery said it was ""working hard to ensure all local and national safe prescribing guidelines are being met"". ""Some of the work we are doing has identified highly specialised medications which are only suitable for specialist consultant prescribing,"" a spokesperson added. ""While medicines will still be available locally, we are looking to ensure the prescribing of these is returned to the most qualified, experienced, knowledgeable and skilled clinicians for the individual specialties involved."" Neurologists in the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, and specialists in Great Ormond Street in London have been treating Seren. Her parents contacted UHW on Tuesday morning and said they were assured that the four drugs prescribed for Seren are all licensed and are needed to control her condition.

'Inadequate' toilet provision on new TfW trains,"Railfuture Wales said the provision was inadequate and could deter some people with health conditions. They are calling for changes to the design to be made now, allowing one toilet per carriage. Transport for Wales (TfW) said the level of provision was the same as on new fleets for other rail operators. The Â£800m worth of new trains, which comprise 51 two-carriage and 26 three-carriage Civity class 197 units, are being built in Spain and fitted out in Newport. They are due to go into operation in 2022. The two-carriage trains have seating for 116 people but can carry more standing at busy times. They will have one accessible toilet between them, while the three-carriage trains will have two. In a letter to TfW, Railfuture Wales said the trains would provide services for journeys of an average two to three hours, and that the proposed provision would result in people possibly not being able to access a WC when required. Only the two-car trains can run on the Cambrian Coast Line in Ceredigion and Gwynedd because of the unique signalling system, and the trains are often full in summer. Peter Kingsbury, chair of Railfuture Wales, wrote: ""Previous practice is to have one WC per carriage on medium and long distance services. ""The proposed provision of one WC for two carriages will result in more people not being able to access a WC when required. ""This could result in people with certain health conditions be unwilling to use these services which would be contrary to Welsh Government equality policies."" 'Always functioning' The group is calling for a smaller toilet - not wheelchair accessible - to be put into the second carriage, which they say would made a ""significant difference"". Mr Kingsbury said the longer average journey times in Wales meant using the one-toilet provision example in other parts of the UK cited by TfW was ""not valid"". In a statement, TfW said it had worked hard to find a balance between seating capacity and the number of toilets. ""We recognise the importance of making sure toilets are always functioning, which is why we have ensured the toilets will be capable of two full days operation,"" it said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

""We have to reach an agreement with the government on this in the next 48 hours,"" she said.

""I think the impact of the Section 114 notice is quite honestly unthinkable, with very serious implications for Tube and bus services in London,"" she added. A TfL spokesperson said it had done everything possible to help reduce the spread of coronavirus. ""This was the right thing to do and has saved lives,"" he said. ""It is clear that the long term impact of the coronavirus will mean that we need financial support now and into the future so that we can support the recovery of London and the UK. ""We are in constructive discussions with the government over the necessary financial support."" In the 2019-20 budget TfL set up a reserve of Â£2.2bn to meet future financial challenges. That year TfL earned Â£4.9bn from fares, making up 47% of the transport authority's income. However, the lockdown has led to a 95% cut in people using the Tube compared to this time last year. The number of bus passengers has also dropped, by 85%, and customers no longer have to tap-in to pay for rides as part of measures to protect drivers. Most TfL services are still running, but 7,000 staff - about 25% of the workforce - have been furloughed to cut costs. Unless emergency funding can be found TfL may publish an unbalanced budget, which would ban TfL from spending any new cash. Conservative candidate for mayor of London, Shaun Bailey, said: ""Coronavirus has only accentuated existing problems. ""The 'fares freeze' - that benefitted tourists, not Londoners - cost TfL over Â£600m in lost revenue. TfL has record debt which stands at Â£13bn. ""Any bailout must come with conditions - you cannot trust Sadiq Khan with a blank cheque.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Anti-Semitic Valentine at Republican student event sparks outrage,"Warning: Some readers may find some language offensive College Republicans at Central Michigan University were distributing gift bags to students on Wednesday when the card was discovered. It featured a picture of Adolf Hitler, alongside Valentine sentiments. The group apologised, saying it did not ""condone this type of rhetoric or anti-Semitism"". A CMU inquiry later concluded that the card was made by a non-student. In a statement, the College Republicans group said: ""At tonight's [Wednesday] College Republican meeting, we had a Valentine's Day party, in which each member decorated a bag and other members placed valentines inside of others' bags. Unfortunately, a very inappropriate card was placed into a bag without other members' knowledge."" CMU President Dr George Ross issued a statement saying the university was ""deeply disappointed"". ""This is not who we are as a campus community,"" Dr Ross wrote. ""Such hurtful, offensive language, while protected by the First Amendment [of the US constitution], is unacceptable and is not consistent with our values and standards."" He said a meeting had been held to address the incident which included representatives from the Diversity Office and the CMU Police Department. After completing an inquiry, the university's Office of Civil Rights and Institutional Equity said on Friday it had ""determined the card was the misguided action of one individual, who readily admitted her role"". The office said the young woman was not a CMU student and had left the campus. CMU students held a rally against hate speech on Thursday, which some Republican students attended. Mackenzie Flynn, president of the CMU College Republicans, told student newspaper Central Michigan Life that the card had not been created from scratch - rather it was printed out from a page of Valentine's Day memes. Alongside Hitler's picture, the card had: ""My love 4 u burns like 6,000 Jews"". It was reportedly signed ""XOXO, Courtney"". ""While still not appropriate, I want to clear up that they did not create it themselves,"" Ms Flynn said. The campus group for Jewish students, Hillel, wrote on Facebook that it was ""deeply concerned and disappointed"". It promised to work with the university ""to ensure all Jewish students feel safe and welcome on campus, and that incidents like this do not happen again"". Six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis in Hitler's death camps during World War Two. Update: This article was amended to include subsequent findings of the CMU Office of Civil Rights and Institutional Equity. An earlier version said the card was made by a CMU student, which the university later said was not the case.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hoo fire: 'Huge explosion' as fire rages at industrial unit,"One resident of Hoo Marina, close to the blaze on Vicarage Lane, described hearing a ""huge explosion"" and an eyewitness said the ""place shook"". Kent Fire and Rescue Service said about 200 people were removed from the area and advised others to keep windows and doors closed. Crews are to stay at the site overnight after the blaze started at 04:40 BST. The flames could be seen from miles around, but no-one was injured. Investigators are yet to establish how the fire started. Mark Woodward, the incident commander for the fire service, said the building was used to store animal welfare equipment and some Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders had exploded in the blaze. Another eyewitness told BBC Radio Kent he heard ""two massive bangs"" at about 05:00. ""We thought it was a thunderbolt because the whole place shook,"" he said. ""All I could see in the background was a red ball of fire and we were all told to evacuate."" Mr Woodward said the blaze had been ""well contained"" and the fire service was ""considering how best to extinguish it"". At its height, 10 fire engines were tackling the flames, and a 200 metre cordon was in place. UK Power Networks confirmed it sent engineers to the area at 10:00 after receiving reports of an interruption to power supplies to 13 properties. The power supply to 40 customers was also cut as work continued to reconnect supplies, the company said. A spokeswoman said the fire had damaged an overhead power cable. Roads in the area were closed off by Medway Council while emergency teams dealt with the blaze. Many residents were sent to the Village Institute in Hoo, where an emergency rest centre was set up. Chris Hosegood said the fire had been intense. ""As we walked up Vicarage Lane we looked back and saw the black smoke and all of a sudden the big fireballs. ""We could feel the heat half way up the lane,"" she said. At 18:30 BST three fire engines were still at the scene, with firefighters saying they would remain for another one or two days. Most residents have been allowed to return home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram. Send your story ideas to southeasttoday@bbc.co.uk.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"'Invest Â£1.1bn EU cash before Brexit', says council leader","Andrew Morgan, from Rhondda Cynon Taf council, says infrastructure projects should be accelerated in light of the Brexit vote. A total of Â£1.1bn of EU funding in Wales is yet to be allocated. The money is due to be invested between now and 2020. But a withdrawal from the EU before then would cut the spending round short. Leave campaigners say the UK government would make up the shortfall, however there has been scepticism from the first minister who says he does not trust the Treasury to make up any shortfall. EU structural funds are managed by the Welsh European Funding Office, which is based in Merthyr Tydfil, and is part of the Welsh Government. Much of the funding yet to be allocated is for the most economically-deprived communities across north and west Wales, and the south Wales valleys. Mr Morgan called for the decision-making and systems governing EU funds to be speeded up. He said: ""The Welsh European Funding Office moves far too slowly. ""It is a drawn out process and if we are being told that European funding is at risk they really have got to go all guns blazing. ""I would hope that the Welsh Government will put pressure on the Welsh European Funding Office to get these projects started as soon as we can. ""If there is a downturn in the economy then these projects could create secure construction jobs."" The council leader said his officials were now working with a greater degree of urgency on a number of EU-funded town-centre regeneration schemes. The body which monitors EU spending in Wales meets for the first time since the referendum on Friday. It will be chaired by the Welsh Government's finance secretary Mark Drakeford. One Vote Leave campaigner, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, said the focus should be on ""outcomes, not spending money for the sake of it"". He said: ""Qualification for structural funding is not a badge of honour, it's a reflection of the relative poverty of those in areas who meet the criteria, and after three successive rounds of funding that money has clearly not been put to good use."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ""We are determined to maximise the EU funds allocated to Wales for the benefit of our people, communities, businesses, universities and colleges. ""Where there is scope to accelerate draw-down of EU funds, we will aim to do just that. ""The protection of jobs, businesses and communities and the delivery of our programmes in Wales is hugely dependent on the timescale for leaving the EU and we need early clarification from the UK government of that timescale. ""We have also called for a guarantee from the UK government that every penny of EU funds to Wales is safe.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen re-labelled food,"The inspection of the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel found food had been re-labelled to extend its shelf life. Dozens of containers of items - including discoloured meat and mouldy cheesecake - had to be disposed of. A spokesman for the DoubleTree said it has adjusted its processes and conducted training. The food hygiene inspection at the hotel, near Aberdeen beach, was carried out on 8 February. Some new labels had been placed directly over the top of old labels. Sticky handles Environmental Health officers found sandwiches had been covered with a wet cloth, and fridge handles were dirty and sticky. Aberdeen City Council said in a statement: ""The report followed a routine inspection, carried out in line with procedure. ""The food business operator resolved the immediate issues at the time of the inspection."" A spokesman for the DoubleTree said: 'We expect to uphold the highest of standards when it comes to food preparation at our hotel. ""We have been working closely to fully address the matters raised in the report. ""As a result we have adjusted our processes and conducted training sessions for our team members, the EHO (Environmental Health officers) re-visited us in March and have indicated they are satisfied with the measures we have taken."" The spokesman added: ""The hotel had not received any food poisoning complaints in the period leading up to the February report."" 'Breaking rules' Ian McWatt, director of operations at Food Standards Scotland, said: ""Scottish local authority environmental health officers have a crucial role to play in enforcing food law at a local level and work closely with food businesses to make sure they are meeting the requirements of food hygiene regulations. ""In cases where compliance levels fall short of required standards, appropriate action is taken to ensure public health is protected. ""It's extremely important that people in Scotland can trust the food they eat and every food business has a responsibility to produce food that is safe and does not mislead consumers."" Prof Hugh Pennington, a leading bacteriologist, told BBC Scotland of the report: ""I'm amazed. It's not just one or two foods. ""They were breaking rules. They have a food safety system and it wasn't being followed.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Snow disruption warning stepped down,"It steps down Police Scotland advice to stage two after being escalated to stage four ""do not travel"" overnight. A yellow Met Office weather warning for snow and ice is now in place for much of the country until Saturday morning. Police asked drivers ""not to be complacent"" and to keep checking for latest updates on the situation Ch Supt Stewart Carle said: ""Road conditions have improved overnight with less snow falling than was expected. ""As a result of this, and motorists heeding our messages and driving to the conditions this morning, we are now able to advise everyone that despite there no longer being a high risk of disruption, there is still a need for all drivers to take extra caution. ""This means that you should continue to make sure you have sufficient fuel for your journey, and have supplies such as warm clothing, food, water and a fully charged mobile phone, before heading out."" He said nobody should ever put themselves at risk on the road and always give consideration to delaying travel or using public transport. ""The yellow warning for snow and ice is now in place, and with our partners we will continue to keep you updated whether conditions improve or worsen, and if there are any incidents that affect the road network,"" he said. A Met Office amber warning of snow and ice expired at 05:00 and advice from Police Scotland was edged down to the ""high risk"" level. It has now been stepped down further.

Russia: Fire kills 14 sailors aboard navy research submersible,"The crew was poisoned by fumes as the vessel was taking measurements in Russian territorial waters on Monday. The ministry gave no details about the type of vessel. But Russian media reports say it was a nuclear mini-submarine used for special operations. The fire was later put out and the vessel is now at Severomorsk, the main base of the Russian Northern Fleet. The defence ministry did not say how many crew members were aboard at the time. Reports in local media say several crew were injured and taken to hospital. An investigation into the incident has begun under the commander-in-chief of the navy. Russian President Vladimir Putin later on Tuesday pulled out of a scheduled event in the Tver region, north-west of Moscow, to discuss the issue with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Mr Putin described the incident as a big loss for the Russian Navy, and expressed ""sincere condolences"" to the victims' families. Seven captains and two service personnel awarded Russia's highest honorary title, Hero of the Russian Federation, were among those who died on board the vessel, the president said. Mr Shoigu was ordered to go immediately to Severomorsk. It's still not clear what caused the fire, which the crew ultimately brought under control; we don't know how many men survived. And there are still questions over exactly what vessel was involved. President Putin said the dead included two heroes of Russia and seven ""captains 1st rank""- which seems unusually senior - for research work. Some media in Russia are citing sources saying they could have been on board a nuclear-powered submarine, possibly even the secretive AS-12. It is thought to be used for highly sensitive missions. Mr Putin returned especially to the Kremlin from out of town to order his defence minister to oversee the investigation. The president is clearly keen not to repeat his disastrous handling of the Kursk submarine disaster in August 2000, when 118 men died. That accident was shrouded in secrecy - and Mr Putin initially stayed on holiday for several days. Submersibles are generally smaller vessels with limited crew on board supported by ships on the surface, while submarines are larger vessels capable of operating autonomously over long distances. The Kursk submarine, which was destroyed by the blasts in the Barents Sea, was also part of the Northern Fleet. Underwater tragedies Accidents involving underwater vessels are rare. Here are some of the most serious:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
How Meryl became Margaret,"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News, in Los Angeles Mark Coulier is one half of the team that transformed one of the world's most recognisable actresses into one of the most famous faces in British political history. ""You can never tell how the Academy is going to vote,"" says Coulier, when we meet at a reception for British nominees in Los Angeles two days ahead of Sunday's Oscars ceremony. ""Somebody said to me before we started on The Iron Lady that it's a career maker or a career breaker. Hopefully it'll make mine."" Prosthetics and paint Coulier and American J Roy Helland are both up for an Oscar for their work on the film. Helland has been doing Streep's hair and make-up for more than 35 years. During the course of The Iron Lady, Streep's Thatcher is seen both in her political prime and as a woman in a her mid-80s, struggling with dementia. For the younger version, Coulier used a small nose piece to alter the bridge of Streep's nose. ""We tried to keep it as subtle as we could,"" he says. But some things had to be toned down. ""Meryl's got great cheekbones and Thatcher's got a fuller face."" The biggest challenge came when the team had to turn Streep into a woman in her mid-80s. That was a job for prosthetics and paint work. But the team wanted to avoid using a full face mask. ""We started off with a plaster cast of Meryl's head,"" explains Coulier. ""We also did computer designs and took Margaret Thatcher's picture and Meryl's picture and fused them together."" Coulier then crafted latex strips from the head that were then applied to Streep's face. Damian Jones, producer of The Iron Lady, recalls the moment he first saw Streep in full make-up. ""It was haunting, I was speechless. It was pretty eerie because there was the old lady of Margaret Thatcher in front of us - and it was Meryl Streep."" The film's director Phyllida Lloyd says that getting the makeup right was one of the most crucial elements of the film. ""We worked so hard in the preparation and the planning of that. We didn't want the makeup to be 'eggy' and a barrier for the audience. ""It comes down to Roy, Mark and Meryl's painstaking attention to detail."" And what of the distinctive Thatcher hairstyle? ""Those wigs were personalities themselves, and there were many of them. And the teeth!"" Lloyd adds: ""Roy's worked with Meryl for over 35 years - it's an amazing relationship and an important part of her preparation and process. It would be very moving if he gets the Oscar.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Myanmar court finds trio guilty of insulting religion,"Philip Blackwood, who managed the VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested in December along with bar owner Tun Thurein and colleague Htut Ko Ko Lwin. They have each been sentenced to two and a half years in jail. Burmese law makes it illegal to insult or damage any religion. The poster, which was posted on Facebook to advertise a cheap drinks night, showed Buddha surrounded by psychedelic colours. It sparked an angry response online. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has seen growing Buddhist nationalism in recent years. All three men had denied insulting religion during their trial. Tun Thurein told the court that Blackwood alone was responsible for the posting. Blackwood had said sorry online and repeated his apology in court. But the judge, Ye Lwin, said that though Blackwood apologised, he had ""intentionally plotted to insult religious belief"" when he uploaded the poster on Facebook, reported AFP news agency. Blackwood, 32, said he planned to appeal against the sentence. Speaking after sentencing outside the court before being bundled into a car, he said that he was ""pretty disappointed"" with his punishment, which was ""more than the maximum sentence"". ""I have said that I was sorry so many times,"" he said. ""It was nothing to do with me."" Before sentencing he said that he had removed the image and posted an apology when he realised it was being shared online and provoking outrage. The New Zealander's family say they hope the government will intervene to deport him. Blackwood's lawyer, Mya Tway, was careful with his assessment of the ruling which has been welcomed by some Buddhist groups. ""It will be difficult to say whether this verdict is fair or not because this is Myanmar, not like other democratic countries. That's all I can say,"" he said. Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said that the three men acted in a culturally insensitive way but should not have been sent to prison. ""By using the Religion Act to criminalise these three individuals, rather than accepting an apology and dealing with it in another way, the government is, sort of, setting up more witch hunts against persons that these Buddhist groups view as being insulting to their religion,"" he said. Mr Robertson said that freedom of expression in Myanmar is under greater threat than ever as the country heads into a pivotal election year. While free speech in Myanmar has improved under the country's semi-civilian government, Buddhist nationalism has been on the rise in recent years, with extremist monks such as Wirathu growing in popularity. At the same time and Muslim minorities have been targeted, particularly in Rakhine state. About 90% of Myanmar's population is Buddhist.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Eurovision Song Contest: Ireland knocked out,"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter, Kiev Galway-born Brendan Murray, 20, had a hot-air balloon with him on stage in Kiev, but it was not enough to lift him into the all-important top 10. Bulgaria's Kristian Kostov progressed to Saturday's grand final, along with acts from nine other countries. Kostov, 17, is the youngest singer this year and is third favourite to win. Austria, Israel and the Netherlands were among the other countries who saw their representatives remain in the competition. Israel will be the first country to perform on Saturday, while Poland has been given the dreaded second slot in the official running order. The slot is considered unlucky because no song performed second in the final has ever gone on to win. Successful semi-finalists Ireland have more Eurovision wins - seven - than any other country but have not won the competition since 1996. They last made it to the final in 2013, when they finished in last place. The fates of the 18 countries involved on Thursday were decided by a combination of votes from national juries and viewers. The 10 successful countries will be joined in the final by the 10 countries, among them Australia, that got the most votes at the first semi-final on Tuesday. An additional six countries, among them the United Kingdom and host nation Ukraine, will also take part in Saturday's event. The UK's hopes this year rest on Welsh singer Lucie Jones, who will be the 18th competing act to perform in the final. Eliminated semi-finalists Singer Jana Burceska from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was another act sent home at the end of the semi-final, broadcast in the UK on BBC Four. Yet the pregnant 23-year-old did have something to celebrate after receiving a marriage proposal from her boyfriend live on air. Sammarinese performer Valentina Monetta also exited the competition after representing San Marino for the fourth time at the contest. Russian singer Julia Samoilova had been due to compete on Thursday but was barred from attending by Ukraine, prompting Russia to withdraw from the competition. Ukraine refused to allow Samoilova to perform because she made a 2015 visit to Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia the previous year. The diplomatic row followed Ukraine's shock victory at last year's contest with a song about Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.

Japan protests over China ships near disputed islands,"This is the first such protest under new PM Shinzo Abe, who was elected last month. It also comes amid reports that he wants to increase defence spending. Chinese ships have sailed near the islands many times since Japan bought them from a private owner last year. Both claim the islands, called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. The row over the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, has left ties between Tokyo and Beijing tense. The dispute over their ownership has rumbled for years but the Japanese government's acquisition of three of the islands from their private Japanese owner sparked a renewed row, triggering public protests in some Chinese cities. Since then Chinese ships have been sailing in and out of waters around the islands, prompting warnings from Japan. Japan's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Akitaka Saiki met Chinese Ambassador Cheng Yonghua in Tokyo to lodge a protest after four Chinese government ships were spotted in the area on Monday. Mr Saiki ""strongly demanded that such incidents do not happen again"", a ministry statement said. Spending plans The move comes amid reports that Japan could increase military spending this year for the first time in more than a decade. A Japanese official told Agence-France Presse news agency that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had decided to increase the budget request by more than 100bn yen ($1.15bn, Â£682.6m). The mooted increase is not large - the defence budget for the year ending in March 2012 stood at 4.65 trillion yen ($53bn). The official said that it would be used ""for research into a new radar system"" and ""maintenance costs for early-warning aircraft"". The Yomiuri newspaper reported similar details. Some of the funds would be allocated to increasing defence personnel, surveillance on the disputed islands with China and purchasing new equipment, Japan's public broadcaster NHK said on its website. The new LDP government was elected late last year, ousting the Democratic Party government of Yoshihiko Noda. New Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is known as a conservative, has pledged a strong stance on the territorial issue while also calling for dialogue with China.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ipswich Town 1981 Uefa Cup victory exhibition,"The club and Ipswich Museum have gathered together photos, video and memorabilia at the Town Hall Galleries. It includes the replica of the trophy and John Wark's two hat-trick balls, which helped him break the Uefa Cup goalscoring record. The free exhibition runs until 3 September 2011. It features gifts exchanged between clubs, grandstand seating for watching DVDs and a sound recorder for visitors to share their memories. Jayne Austin, collections manager at the museum, said: ""We really want people to feel like they're involved in the match. ""You can sit there in genuine stadium seats watching a DVD we've had custom-made for the exhibition and you can climb up the steps and join Mick Mills lifting the Uefa Cup. ""So many people have anecdotes that they want to share about those days and the ones that stick in my mind are the ones about the good behaviour of the fans at a time when English football hooliganism was infamous."" 'Battered teams' Ipswich's first foray in Europe was in the European Cup in 1962 following their League Championship victory under Alf Ramsey. After winning a preliminary tie against Floriana of Malta, they lost 4-2 on aggregate to AC Milan in the first round. Starting with the 1973-74 Uefa Cup campaign, Bobby Robson took them into Europe for nine out of ten seasons, culminating in the 1981 victory over AZ Alkmaar of Holland in the two-legged final. John Wark was the highest goalscorer in 1980-81 with 14, a record for the Uefa Cup at the time. ""[Portman Road] was a fortress,"" said Mr Wark. ""The night games brought a full house, they got behind us and we battered teams. ""They were scared and as we were coming out you could see the fear in their eyes and it was like a one goal start. ""I think the header at St Etienne is the goal that sticks out, but it's a great feat to score three penalties in one game against the same goalkeeper [against Aris Salonika in the first round]."" Ipswich captain Mick Mills was also skipper of the side that won the FA Cup in 1978. He said the Uefa Cup final second leg was almost an anti-climax: ""We basically did all the work at home by winning 3-0. ""In many respects it was almost quite a disappointing day to win the Uefa Cup in a big stadium that wasn't really full and, having lost the game as well [4-2], it wasn't so exciting. ""But round for round, winning the Uefa Cup was a far bigger achievement than winning the FA Cup.""

"Wales' child safety 'needs more co-ordination ,' says charity","The report calls for a ""whole-government approach to child accident prevention"" with road and water safety the priorities, as well as home safety. On a scale for proven methods of reducing accidental death and injury, Wales was put at 30.5 out of 60 compared with Scotland's 39. The Welsh government said child protection was a priority. The report by the charity - the organisation for voluntary, statutory and professional organisations and individuals - delivers a ""could do better"" message over Wales' approach to child safety. Its 2012 ""report card"" gives an overall mark of fair, noting that Wales has ""done a good job of addressing safety issues for children and adolescents on the road"" while safety in the home has also seen some progress, it claims. But the report says that ""stronger leadership and ownership would improve prevention measures and outcomes for children and young people in Wales"". The report shows that on a scale of 60 for proven methods of reducing accidental death and injury, Wales scored 30.5, up from 29.5 in 2009. But it gives Wales just one star out of a possible five for cycling safety and water safety/drowning prevention. It notes that 57 children and adolescents up to the age of 19 died as a result of injury in 2009. It said that if the rate of injury was reduced to that of the Netherlands, 37% of those, or 21, could have been saved. 'Significant improvements' As well as calling for a whole-government approach, the report calls on the Welsh government to do ""more to support a culture of good practice"" from national to local levels. The charity's child safety development officer, Karen McFarlane, said: ""Many of these accidents cause lifelong changes for both the children and their families. ""We shouldn't wrap children in cotton wool, but instead, understand that there are 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' risks. ""It is the 'unacceptable' risks, such as drowning, falling from windows, road accidents, that the report card is aiming to address. ""Other European countries have proved that these types of accidents are preventable and we can reduce the number of children who receive fatal, serious and disabling injuries in Wales."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The protection and safety of children is of paramount importance. ""While many of the issues identified in the report are non-devolved, we welcome the findings in the report that show improvements have been made to injury prevention. ""In terms of road safety, we have seen significant improvements in the last decade, with a 54% reduction in instances of children being killed or seriously injured by 2011.

"Avon and Wiltshire trust 'falsified records', report claims","The authors said records at Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust (AWP) records were ""undoubtedly"" changed to meet staff performance targets. The independent report, written in 2012, was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. AWP said it investigated the report's findings but found no proof that patient records had been altered. The trust added there was ""no evidence patient care had been affected"". ""When the issue of alleged falsifying of data was first brought to our attention approximately 18 months ago, we carried out a full investigation,"" an AWP spokesman said. ""Neither that investigation, nor subsequent investigations by independent parties found any evidence to support the claims and the matter is now officially closed."" He added that ""service users should be reassured that we have absolute confidence in the accuracy and reliability of data held on our systems"". 'System under stress' The 2012 report was written by three NHS workers and two independent consultants, one a psychiatrist and the other the head of safeguarding at another mental health trust. It came after 30 staff raised concerns and concluded staff were attempting to avoid ""breached performance"" targets which the trust took a ""zero tolerance approach to"". It also noted that, although the investigation only looked at records in Wiltshire, it was ""likely to have happened"" elsewhere in the trust, which also covers Bristol and Bath. But it said while senior managers did not offer ""constructive guidance about how targets might be met"", there is ""no evidence that they gave instructions or advice to falsify data"". The report said while the complaints ""probably represented a significant symptom of a system under stress"", it should not be seen in isolation. It stated that ""the majority of staff appeared as hard working and caring clinicians who were under significant duress"". The report concluded that the AWP board needed to change its culture from one that was ""target-driven"" and ""dictating"" to one which was ""open and inclusive"" where patients were ""at the heart of its business"". AWP said the claims were investigated both internally and by two independent reviewers, who previously worked at the NHS, one as a chief executive in the organisation. The trust underwent a management change in October 2012 and a subsequent report said there had been ""significant change in organisational culture"" with less of a push to ""achieve targets"".

Montenegro election: Djukanovic declares ruling party victory,"But his pro-Western party is set to win 41% of the votes, short of the majority he wanted to ensure a push to join Nato and the EU. Mr Djukanovic had presented the vote as a choice between the West or becoming a ""Russian colony"". Earlier, authorities said 20 Serbian paramilitaries had been arrested. Prosecutors said the group may have been planning to kidnap Mr Djukanovic, who has been in charge for a quarter of a century. The development, hours before voting took place, was described by opposition Democratic Front leader Andrija Mandic as ""gross propaganda"" and Serbia's prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, said the timing was strange. Serbia's former special forces commander, Bratislav Dikic, who was removed from the post in 2013 because of alleged criminal activities, was reported to be among those arrested. The men had been charged with terror offences and one Serb was still on the run, Montenegro's police chief said. Montenegro: Nato's newest and last member? Montenegro country profile Mr Djukanovic will now try to form a majority with smaller parties, and told supporters as the results came through that ""tonight we can say that Montenegro will continue its path towards a secure place in Europe"". Montenegro would formally join Nato in months and step up talks on joining the EU, he said. The Democratic Front Alliance, made up of largely pro-Serbian and pro-Russian groups, is forecast to win just over 20% of the votes. It also hopes to form a coalition among other opposition parties. Another, more moderate, opposition grouping stands at about 11%. Many Montenegrins are unhappy that Mr Djukanovic is taking the country into Nato. They remain angry that Nato bombed Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 as part of a strategy to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's then southern province of Kosovo. The opposition accuses Mr Djukanovic of corruption and cronyism, which he denies. He accuses them of receiving funding from Moscow, which they deny. Montenegro, which has a population of some 630,000, has in recent years seen an influx of Russian money, homebuyers and tourists since splitting from Serbia in 2006.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mary Lou McDonald rejects Peter Robinson's border poll claims,"The ex-DUP leader argued there could be chaos if a united Ireland was voted for in a border poll by 50% of voters plus one, but Ms McDonald denied this. ""What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,"" said Ms McDonald. ""Partition is maintained on the basis of 50% plus one and then constitutional change and a new Ireland is ushered in on that basis - that's democracy."" Mr Robinson was not in attendance at a political leaders' debate at west Belfast festival FÃ©ile an Phobail. The debate was attended by seven political figures from across Ireland. Robin Swann (UUP); Stephen Farry (Alliance); Colum Eastwood (SDLP); Simon Hamilton (DUP); Mary Lou McDonald (Sinn FÃ©in); Simon Harris (Fine Gael) and Lisa Chambers (Fianna FÃ¡il) all sat on the panel. Fianna FÃ¡il's Lisa Chambers said that if nationalists won a border poll using the current mechanism ""peace would not be preserved"". When asked if she would consider any change to the 50% plus one system, Ms McDonald said no. She also said she accepted British identity and that people who are British in Northern Ireland would still be British in a united Ireland. But DUP MLA Simon Hamilton accused Sinn FÃ©in of not showing respect for British identity in Northern Ireland. Alliance's Stephen Farry, who filled in for party leader Naomi Long, said Brexit had been destabilising and that a border poll was probably inevitable. UUP leader Robin Swann argued that the focus on such a referendum was a distraction from the need to restore Stormont, a sentiment echoed by Mr Hamilton. The devolved administration collapsed in January 2017. Before leaving the debate at St Mary's University Belfast early to catch a flight, Mr Swann he expressed his belief that Stormont could be restored if all parties - not just Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP - were given roles in talks. He said Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told him she did not have any plans for talks on restoring power at Stormont. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood said he did not believe there should be a border poll until after Brexit, while Fine Gael's Simon Harris said creating a new Ireland before restoring Stormont was missing the point.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sydney seaplane crash: Wreckage raised from riverbed,"On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage in sections from a depth of 13m (40ft). Officials said a crash involving the same plane in 1996 would form part of their wide-ranging investigation. On Thursday, the majority of the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver - including its fuselage, floats and a wing - was retrieved from the River Hawkesbury about 50km (30 miles) north of Sydney. The crash killed Compass Group chief executive Mr Cousins, 58, his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and Sydney-based pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, not far from the crash site. The businessman's brothers, Simon and Andrew Cousins, said on Thursday: ""We are fortunate and thankful for the outpouring of love and support we've received from across the world."" ""We are deeply touched by the tributes to Richard, William, Edward, Emma and Heather in the media and throughout the community."" The recovery effort, which began at 06:00 local time (19:00 GMT Wednesday), continued late into the day. Police described it as a complex operation, with divers attaching slings to the wreckage amid ""zero visibility"". What happened in 1996? According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, the same plane was involved in an accident that killed a pilot 22 years ago. Its wingtip had struck a hill amid gusty conditions ""conducive to windshear and turbulence"" in rural New South Wales, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report. Investigators said the aircraft was climbing at almost maximum weight when it clipped the ground, sending it into a cartwheel. The plane was then repaired and cleared to fly again under official safety requirements, the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority told the BBC. It had since flown thousands of trips as a sightseeing plane until the crash on New Year's Eve. ATSB executive director Nat Nagy said a ""number of factors"" were involved in the 1996 crash but it would be examined as part of a thorough investigation into the plane's history. Seaplanes Pilots Association vice-president Kevin Bowe told the Sydney Morning Herald that crashed planes were rebuilt to a condition that was ""often better than new"". How long will the current investigation take? ATSB investigators have said they will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" Mr Nagy said on Tuesday. Investigators, he added, would rigorously examine the wreckage, gather witness accounts and examine the pilot's flying history, in an effort to learn what happened.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Robin Thicke: Blurred Lines tops all-time download chart,"The song has sold 1.54 million copies since it was released last May, despite criticisms of its explicit lyrics. About 20 university student unions banned the track, saying it promoted ""date rape culture"", an accusation Thicke consistently denied. Its sales tally was revealed in a countdown of the UK's Top 100 downloads on BBC Radio 1. Compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), the chart marked 10 years of legal downloads in the UK. Thicke's song overtook the previous best-seller, Adele's Someone Like You, to take the top spot. Adele's ballad has racked up 1.53 million sales to date. Moves Like Jagger by Maroon Five was at number three, followed by Australian one-hit wonder Gotye, with 2012's Somebody That I Used To Know at four. The Black Eyed Peas completed the top five with the party anthem I Gotta Feeling. According to the Official Charts Company, more than 99% of singles are now purchased as digital downloads. Fans have bought more than 1.17 billion tracks in the past 10 years, with 27 songs passing the one million download mark. The latest to achieve the feat is Pharrell Williams' Happy, which has surpassed 1.3 million sales since its release last summer. Happy took ninth place in the all-time download chart, giving Williams three entries in the top 10. The others came from his guest appearances on Blurred Lines and Daft Punk's Get Lucky. The Top 100 was unveiled as part of a UK music industry initiative called A Decade Of Digital. It celebrates 10 years since sites like iTunes and Napster launched in the UK, helping legitimise the download market. 'Not sleazy' Blurred Lines was released 11 months ago and continues to sell, having sold 70,000 copies since January. Official Charts Company boss Martin Talbot said: ""To become one of only two tracks to have been downloaded 1.5m times - and climb to the top of the poll as the biggest download of all time - is an incredible achievement."" However, the song's lyrics - which find the 37-year-old in a club talking to a woman who may, or may not, want to go home with him - have proved problematic. ""I know you want it, but you're a good girl,"" Thicke sings. A video featuring three topless women fuelled allegations the song was misogynistic. Last September, contributors to Project Unbreakable, a photographic project dedicated to survivors of sexual assault, held up placards comparing words spoken by their attackers to lines from the song. But Thicke has told the BBC his critics didn't ""get"" the song. ""I don't want to be sleazy, I'm a gentleman, I've been in love with the same woman since I've been a teenager. I don't want to do anything inappropriate."" Upon hearing it had become the most-downloaded song in UK history, Thicke said: ""I'm so honoured, the success of Blurred Lines is a dream come true.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: North East hospitals warn over 'rapidly rising' admissions,"Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital has temporarily suspended non-urgent elective surgery to free up staff. In a joint statement, the bosses of several health trusts said they were having to deal with ""rapidly rising"" numbers of covid-related admissions. They have appealed to the public to only attend A&E if they have ""serious or life-threatening emergencies."" The statement said it was ""unknown territory"" once lockdown ends on 2 December and urged people to follow self-isolation, social distancing and hygiene rules. ""Over the past few weeks, we have seen cases in our communities increasing and, as a result, hospital admissions are rising rapidly,"" the statement added. ""Unfortunately, this is a trend we are likely to see continue going into winter."" The statement was endorsed by the leaders of the seven council areas which cover Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and County Durham. Yvonne Ormston, chief executive at Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust, said the situation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital would be reviewed daily ""in a bid to reinstate our services as soon as we can."" The North East went into the four-week lockdown as the only part of England where the number of new Covid cases was flattening, but numbers have risen in the past fortnight. 'Expect some plateauing' Prof Eugene Milne, Newcastle's director of public health, warned the city is set to be placed under the toughest tier three Covid restrictions, once the lockdown ends. He said infection rates would need to drop ""significantly"" to avoid tier three and doubted that such a rapid fall would be possible, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. In the week to 14 November, Newcastle reported 1,359 new cases, with an infection rate of 448.8 per 100,000 of the population, government figures show. Prof Milne added: ""If I were to predict what is going to happen between now and the end of the month, I would expect some plateauing or possibly a fall. But I doubt it is going to be a fall to the level that I think we would need. ""By that, I am suggesting that we would want to be down to 250 per 100,000 per week or below to think we were likely on that count to be in a position to consider lower tier status.""

Covid: Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health boards offer tests for 'flu symptoms',"People in the Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health board areas with flu symptoms or who are unwell after contact with a confirmed Covid case can get tested. Cwm Taf Morgannwg is offering mass testing for asymptomatic people, but not for a wider range of symptoms. National guidance only offers testing to those with a fever, cough or change in taste or smell. Those living in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion can now be tested if they have ""flu-like symptoms"", are ""generally feeling unwell and a history of being in contact with a known Covid-19 case"" or have ""any new or change in symptoms following a previous negative test"". A new regional testing centre has opened in Baglan, with the capacity to carry out 2,800 tests a day. The new centre joins the regional testing centre at the Liberty Stadium and a number of mobile testing units across Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. The smaller Margam testing unit will become a base for community testing of staff. The new testing regime, which is also being trialled by Hywel Dda University Health Board, will be reviewed after 28 days. Swansea Bay health board said it had capacity to offer the testing because of a fall in demand since the end of last year. Alison Shakeshaft, director of therapies and health science at Hywel Dda University Health Board, said: ""We know the wider group of symptoms do occur in Covid-19 but are not reported as often as the 'classic three' symptoms. With the very low rates of flu circulating at the moment, it is more likely that wider flu-like symptoms are due to Covid-19. ""Our aim is to find as many Covid-19 cases as possible so we can prevent the virus being passed on to others. We want to do everything we can to help bring the pandemic to a close as fast as possible and help restrictions to be lifted."" A spokesperson for Powys Teaching Health Board said: ""We use the national definitions of the Covid-19 symptoms, which remain unchanged."" Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said in a statement: ""The current national advice is that individuals should isolate and get a Covid-19 test if they have any of the following three symptoms: a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, a loss or change to your smell or taste.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Canada's 'free the beer' case loses in Supreme Court,"Canada's top court upheld a New Brunswick liquor law limiting the amount of alcohol that can be carried across its provincial border. In 2012, Gerald Comeau was stopped and fined for bringing more than the 12-pint limit of beer back from neighbouring Quebec. He took the matter to court in a case quickly dubbed ""free the beer"". Mr Comeau's legal battle was watched closely by industries across the country because any change in interprovincial trade restrictions could have had ramifications nationwide. The New Brunswick retiree liked to drive to pick up beer in the province of Quebec, where he could get a bargain on a few cases. Returning from one trip in October 2012, he had his liquor purchases seized from his car boot, and was fined C$292 ($230; Â£170). His lawyers argued the country's internal trade barriers infringed on Mr Comeau's constitutional rights by conflicting with a section of the constitution that states that Canadian goods shall ""be admitted free into each of the other provinces"". Most provinces set limits on the amount of alcohol a person can bring back from another province for personal consumption, and joined the province of New Brunswick in the litigation as interveners. On Thursday in a unanimous decision, the top court said free trade across Canada was not an absolute. It emphasised the powers of the provinces to make laws within their own jurisdictions, even if - as in the case of New Brunswick's liquor restrictions - coincidental limits were placed on free trade. Interpreting the constitution to ""require full economic integration would significantly undermine the shape of Canadian federalism, which is built upon regional diversity within a single nation"", the decision states. The court found a broad interpretation of the constitution would have had serious implications on numerous other provincial regulations, including environmental controls. Litigator Andrew Bernstein said while the ruling upholds the status quo, ""it's a very important decision when you look at the way the court is going to look at federalism"". He noted the issue of provincial jurisdiction and federal government powers has cropped up in a number of recent hot-button issues in Canada, from cannabis to carbon taxes and pipelines. Wineries and liquor producers across Canada had also been hopeful the court case would open the door to allowing them to sell and ship more of their product to clients nationwide. Mr Bernstein said the ruling does not preclude that from ever happening, just that provinces will need to co-operate ""if we want to allow Canadian businesses to expand their markets to other provinces"". ""This is going to have to be negotiated by the provinces rather than decreed by the Supreme Court,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China jails two more Tibetan monks over fire death,"Chinese authorities say the man, Rigzin Phuntsog of the Kirti monastery, immolated himself on 16 March. Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum will be jailed for 13 and 10 years respectively for ""intentional homicide"", Xinhua news agency said. On Monday, the court jailed another monk for 11 years over the death. Drongdru, Phuntsog's uncle, is accused of hiding him after he set himself on fire and depriving him of medical attention for 11 hours. The exact circumstances surrounding the monk's death remain unclear. The latest verdicts come as the US questioned whether China had followed its own legal standards in the case. ""We urge Chinese leaders to address policies in Tibetan areas that have created tension and to protect Tibetans' unique linguistic, cultural and religious identity,"" a state department statement said. Crackdown The incident happened in March in Sichuan province's Aba county, where there is a large ethnic Tibetan community. There is disagreement about how the monk died. At the time, Tibetan rights groups reported that witnesses saw police put out the flames, then begin beating the monk, at which point monks and local people took him to the monastery before taking him to hospital some hours later. After Phuntsog's death protests were then reported in the area around the monastery, followed by a heavy security presence. Rights groups accused the government of shutting the monks in the monastery and forcing them to take part in compulsory ""patriotic education"". In March 2008, Tibet witnessed a wave of violent anti-China protests - its worst unrest in 20 years. China responded to the unrest with a military crackdown, including in areas like Aba which are outside Tibet but have a large ethnic Tibetan population. Many Tibetans have complained about the growing domination of China's majority Han population in Tibet and accuse the government of trying to dilute their culture. But China says it has invested heavily in Tibet and has generated significant improvements in people's living standards. There have been a number of incidents of monks setting themselves on fire to protest against Beijing's rule. Earlier this month, a 29-year-old Tibetan monk burned himself to death in another town Sichuan. Activists said the monk, whom they named as Tsewang Norbu, had shouted slogans including ""We Tibetan people want freedom"" and ""Long live the Dalai Lama"" before setting himself alight.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jack Phillips: Boy from Godalming became Titanic hero,"By Sally NancarrowBBC News, Surrey The son of a draper, Jack Phillips operated the most modern and powerful wireless equipment of any merchant ship of the time. But before the doomed vessel sailed, he told a friend he would have preferred to be aboard a smaller ship - for Jack had a dread of icebergs. Nonetheless his actions in the early hours of 15 April 1912, as Titanic sank in the Atlantic, ensured that he was remembered as a hero of the disaster. He stayed at his post, sending out the distress calls and advising on the latest position of the ship until it foundered. His last message was picked up by another ship, the Virginia, at 02:17, three minutes before the stern sank. His body was never found and it is believed he went down with the liner. ""He was a tremendous hero at the time,"" said Alison Pattison, curator of an exhibition about Phillips at Godalming Museum. ""His messages brought the Carpathia to people in the lifeboats. ""That is the reason they survived. Otherwise they would have died of exposure."" In all, 705 people were rescued, though more than 1,500 perished. Phillips was born and grew up above the shop where his father worked in Farncombe, near Godalming, and his first job was at the local Post Office, where he learnt Morse code, before moving on to Marconi. He was 25 on 11 April 1912, the day after Titanic set sail from Southampton. But although he is remembered as a hero, his role is not without controversy. Two warning messages of icebergs from other ships in the area were not passed on to the bridge - Phillips was concentrating on handling messages for passengers. ""There is a lot of controversy about the whole sinking of the Titanic... everything from the quality of the rivets to the messages that Jack and his assistant Harold Bride received,"" said Ms Pattison. ""Something we really want to do is to put that in context and remind people that when it came to it, Jack behaved with extraordinary heroism. ""He sent messages from the moment the captain first told him the ship was going down and he stayed at his post, even when the captain told both the radio operators they should save themselves. ""Harold Bride left at that point and he did survive, but Jack wouldn't go."" Since the exhibition opened on 6 March, thousands of people have visited and learned Phillips's story. ""The reaction has been really wonderful. It is unprecedented - really remarkable,"" said Ms Pattison. Ms Pattison said children were among the most enthusiastic visitors, enjoying activities such as dressing up and trying to guess whether their outfits were for first class or steerage passengers. ""Children are fascinated,"" she said. ""It is quite an old fashioned story - about duty and how a young boy from a small Surrey village found himself in such an impossible situation and ended up such a hero.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Church of England schools tackle gay bullying,"The Bible or religious texts should not be used to justify homophobic behaviour, says the advice sent to all Church of England schools. But homosexuality is recognised as a ""divisive issue"" in the church. The guidance says that Church of England schools should not turn a ""convenient blind eye"" to prejudice. ""Schools should ensure their behaviour policies include clear expectations that homophobic behaviour and language will not be tolerated and that there can be no justification for this negative behaviour based on the Christian faith or the Bible,"" says the advice. It warns that schools of all kinds can be ""among the most homophobic social spaces"". 'Terrible impact' The guidance and accompanying report, Valuing All God's Children: Guidance for Church of England Schools on Challenging Homophobic Bullying, were published on Monday at a school in south London. The documents set out policies for how Church of England schools, which teach a million pupils, can discourage and prevent a culture of homophobic bullying. ""Less than a year ago I set out my concerns about the terrible impact of homophobic bullying on the lives of young people and I made a public commitment to support our schools in eradicating homophobic stereotyping and bullying,"" said Archbishop Welby. ""Church schools begin from the belief that every child is loved by God. This guidance aims to help schools express God's love by ensuring that they offer a safe and welcoming place for all God's children."" The guidance makes recommendations for schools to follow, including that staff are trained to deal with such bullying. And it says that pupils might have friends or family who are gay - or will have seen gay celebrities on television. ""For many children and young people living in today's UK, this is a non-issue, just a matter of fact,"" says the school guidance. ""To deny this reality is to choose to be blinkered."" But it also recognises that there are different views on sexuality - and that these should be respected. ""It is also equally important to communicate clearly to pupils and families that holding traditional faith perspectives on sexuality is not counter to the school's aims and ethos, but that expressing hatred, negativity and hostility to another is unacceptable.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: University of Exeter virtual protests over 'lost' student experience,"By Adam DurbinBBC News Online University of Exeter student Bella Enoizi's petition has more than 20,000 signatures. The petition cited ""screen-sharing malfunctions, audio loss and Wi-Fi connectivity"" in online learning as hampering their learning experience. The University of Exeter issued a message to all students with a ""no disadvantage guarantee"" on Friday. The #saveourgrades campaign saw students post on university social media feeds for more support. Ms Enoizi, a third year English literature and Italian student, said a strain on student's mental wellbeing, with most being ""stuck at home"" and a variety of issues with online learning meant better academic and mental health assistance needed to be provided. Ms Enoizi's group, Students for Academic Mitigation, has called for fairer grading for students in light of these issues. ""It goes without saying that every single student this year is facing exceptional circumstances as a result of Covid,"" she added. Ms Enoizi said her teaching had been ""cut in half"" and she was ""really struggling to make up for that myself"", citing ""active discussion"" with fellow students as a key part of learning. ""All of that has been lost really. ""Trying to learn a language over Zoom is difficult and an oral exam virtually is a really daunting prospect,"" she said. 'Supporting mental health' Commenting on Facebook, students have pointed to a decrease in contact hours and the inability to use ""basic resources like the library"" as having a serious impact on their academic performance. One wrote: ""No cohort has ever or will ever have to live through a global pandemic, much less have to focus on writing essays, reports and completing endless hours of self teaching at home at the same time."" Ms Enozi cited the lack of laboratory time for science students to refine their research skills or access to archives for humanities students working on their dissertations. She said: ""The majority of us are stuck at home, not in our university towns, some don't even have a desk or even access to reliable WiFi."" In a statement, the University of Exeter said it was offering students a ""no-disadvantage guarantee"" after discussions with student representatives. This will mean taking a ""consistent approach"" to grading, comparing marks with previous years and creating ""safety nets"" for year groups and individual students to apply for mitigation and for examiners to make grade adjustments to correct any ""significant deviation"". ""This safety net means that your year group will suffer no detriment when compared to those who came before you, and those who will follow,"" the university added.

Justin Bieber treated by doctors after O2 Arena concert,"Melissa Victor said the Canadian singer took a 20-minute rest before returning to the stage to finish the show. The 19-year-old star was performing the third out of four nights at the venue. Earlier this week he was criticised for keeping fans waiting after coming on stage late for Monday's performance. Ms Victor said after the concert: ""[Justin's] heading to the doctor now. He fainted and took a 20-minute reprieve and was given oxygen."" In a video posted by a fan on YouTube, Bieber's manager Scooter Braun was seen on stage during the show giving the audience an explanation as to why the show had come to a temporary halt. He told fans: ""Justin got very light of breath, the whole show he's been complaining. He's backstage with the EMTs [emergency medical team] and the doctor. ""They're telling him they want him to go and see somebody and find out what's going on with his lungs, he's just told me that in five minutes, if it's OK with you guys, he's going to come out and finish the show. ""So he might not be jumping around as much and everything else, you guys need to be patient with us, we're not trying to be disrespectful, we're not trying to get you guys home late, we're truly trying to put on a show for the people who love him."" Bieber did then come back on stage and completed the show, before being examined by medical staff after its conclusion. It has not been confirmed whether he needed to attend hospital. The star later tweeted a message to his 35.6 million followers on Twitter, in which he said: ""Getting better. Thanks for everyone pulling me thru tonight. Best fans in the world. Figuring out what happened. Thanks for the love."" He also sent a picture of himself, via Instagram, lying in what appeared to be a hospital bed with the caption ""gettin' better"".

Swine flu offers 'extraordinary super immunity',"By Michelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News In beating a bout of H1N1 the body makes antibodies that can kill many other flu strains, a study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine shows. Doctors hope to harness this power to make a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any type of influenza. Ultimately this could replace the ""best guess"" flu vaccines currently used. Such a vaccine is the ""holy grail"" for flu researchers. Many scientists are already testing different prototypes to put an end to the yearly race to predict coming flu strains and quickly mass produce a new vaccine each flu season. Dr Patrick Wilson who led the latest research said the H1N1 swine flu virus that reached pandemic levels infecting an estimated 60 million people last year, had provided a unique opportunity for researchers. ""It demonstrates how to make a single vaccine that could potentially provide immunity to all influenza. ""The surprise was that such a very different influenza strain, as opposed to the most common strains, could lead us to something so widely applicable."" Extraordinary immunity In the nine patients they studied who had caught swine flu during the pandemic, they found the infection had triggered the production of a wide range of antibodies that are only very rarely seen after seasonal flu infections or flu vaccination. Five antibodies isolated by the team could fight all the seasonal H1N1 flu strains from the last decade, the devastating ""Spanish flu"" strain from 1918 which killed up to 50m people, plus a potentially deadly bird flu H5N1 strain. The researchers believe the ""extraordinarily"" powerful antibodies were created as the body learned how to fight the new infection with swine flu using its old memory of how to fight off other flu viruses. Next they plan to examine the immune response of people who were vaccinated against last year's swine flu but did not get sick to see if they too have the same super immunity to flu. Dr Sarah Gilbert is a expert in viruses at Oxford University and has been testing her own prototype universal flu vaccine. She said: ""Many scientists are working to develop a vaccine that would protect against the many strains of flu virus. ""This work gives us more confidence that it will be possible to generate a universal flu vaccine."" But she said it would take many years for a product to go through the necessary tests and trials. ""It will take at least five years before anything like this could be widely available."" The number of deaths this winter from flu verified by the Health Protection Agency currently is 50, with 45 of these due to swine flu.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Quiz: Life as a woman in Saudi Arabia In pictures: Saudi women vote At the scene: The BBC's Orla Guerin in Riyadh The election is for municipal councils with few powers, but it's a milestone for Saudi women. As soon as the polls were open at 0800 local time in Riyadh, Hatoon al-Fassi rushed to cast her vote. The Saudi academic and women's rights campaigner had to be driven there. Women are still banned from taking the wheel here. She voted in an almost empty polling station, for women only. The election is segregated, like everything else in this deeply conservative society. ""It feels great,"" she said as she emerged, with a huge smile. ""This is a historical moment. I thank God I am living it."" She has been pushing for this day for more than a decade. Ms Fassi said it did not matter how many women actually get elected. ""I am not really worried about the number, or to have any women winning,"" she told us. ""The fact that we have gone through this exercise is what really matters."" Elections themselves are a rare thing in the Saudi kingdom - Saturday will be only the third time in history that Saudis have gone to the polls. There were no elections in the 40 years between 1965 and 2005. The decision to allow women to take part was taken by the late King Abdullah and is seen as a key part of his legacy. In announcing the reforms, King Abdullah said women in Saudi Arabia ""have demonstrated positions that expressed correct opinions and advice"". Before he died in January, he appointed 30 women to the country's top advisory Shura Council. There are 2,100 council seats available in Saturday's vote. An additional 1,050 seats are appointed with approval from the king. The results of the elections are expected to be announced later. Saudi women have been commenting on the elections on Twitter:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Life-extending lung cancer nivolumab drug approved,"Campaigners, including the late Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill, have repeatedly called for access to the immunotherapy, which can add months to life. Scotland already offers nivolumab to people with advanced disease who have also tried chemotherapy. England's drugs watchdog had originally said nivolumab was too expensive. More life In new draft guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has approved nivolumab through the fast-track Cancer Drugs Fund while more evidence is gathered on its cost-effectiveness. That means some patients - about 1,300 people with advanced squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (whose tumours express a molecule called PD-L1) - will now be eligible for the drug. It is not the first immunotherapy drug available for advanced lung cancer - pembrolizumab was approved for use in December 2016 - but nivolumab hit the headlines during AA Gill's final weeks. He described nivolumab as ""more life spent on Earth - but only if you can pay"". Research has shown that nivolumab increases the number of patients still alive after three years of treatment by two- or three-fold, depending on the type of lung cancer they have. The former smoker was diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to his neck and pancreas, with tumours that were inoperable and unsuitable for radiotherapy. Gill said he had been denied a drug - costing about Â£5,000 a month - that may have helped him live ""considerably"" longer and was the weapon of choice for ""every oncologist in the First World"". What is Nivolumab? Nivolumab (brand name Opdivo) is a type of immunotherapy that stimulates the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. It works by interrupting the chemical signals that cancers use to convince the immune system they are healthy tissue. Patients can have nivolumab into a vein as a drip. It is used to treat advanced melanoma, blood cancer (Hodgkin lymphoma), kidney cancer and the most common type of lung cancer - non small-cell lung cancer. It is also used in clinical trials for other types of cancer. Prof Carole Longson, from NICE, said: ""We know that nivolumab is clinically effective for some people with lung cancer, but the full extent of its benefit is not clear. ""This new deal means that we can give patients access to what we know is a promising treatment whilst more evidence is gathered on its value."" Prof Paul Workman, from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said: ""Immunotherapies are currently very expensive, but one of the ways to make them more cost-effective is to direct them to patients most likely to respond. Today's decision is a welcome step in the right direction.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK to probe Huawei staff's role at cybersecurity centre,"The news follows a report by Parliament's intelligence committee which raised concerns that staff working at the base in Oxfordshire were employed by the Chinese telecoms firm. Part of their job is to test Huawei's own equipment for vulnerabilities. US politicians have claimed that the company posed a threat because of links to China's government and military. The allegations are based, in part, on the fact that the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former member of the People's Liberation Army. But Huawei has strongly denied having close ties to the Chinese state and has stressed that it is 98.6% owned by its workers, with the other 1.4% held by its founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei. Although the firm has been prevented from bidding for many US infrastructure contracts, it has been active in the UK after striking a multi-billion pound deal to provide networking equipment to BT in 2005. A spokeswoman for Huawei highlighted the fact that the government has said it is confident that UK networks using the firm's equipment ""operated to a high standard of security and integrity"". She added that her company supported the decision to carry out a review. Trade links The UK's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) raised concerns about the company's involvement in the Cyber Security Evaluations Centre in Banbury, Oxfordshire, last month. ""While we recognise that there are some benefits associated with the current staffing arrangements for the Cell, these do not, in our opinion, outweigh the risks of Huawei effectively policing themselves,"" its report read. It added that national security was potentially being put at risk by the government's fear of jeopardising trade links with Beijing and it said staff from intelligence agency GCHQ should take over work at the centre. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""We take threats to our critical national infrastructure very seriously and need to be responsive to changes in a fast-moving and complex, globalised telecommunications marketplace. ""We have robust procedures in place to ensure confidence in the security of UK telecommunications networks. ""However, we are not complacent and as such we have agreed to the main recommendation of the report to conduct a review of Huawei's Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (the 'Banbury Cell') to give assurance that we have the right measures and processes in place to protect UK telecommunications."" The Chinese firm said that it welcomed the decision. ""Huawei shares the same goal as the UK government and the ISC in raising the standards of cybersecurity in the UK and ensuring that network technology benefits UK consumers,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Huawei is open to new ideas and ways of working to improve cybersecurity.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK government to press for European Court reform,"Ken Clarke said the government would press for changes to the way the court operated when the UK takes over the chairmanship of the Council of Europe. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, he said the European Convention of Human Rights would continue to be adhered to. Last week it was announced that a commission would be set up to examine a possible British Bill of Rights. The commission, which will be jointly chaired by Mr Clarke and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, will look at whether the UK Bill of Rights could overrule the European Convention of Human Rights. ""The government's policy is to investigate a case for a British Bill of Rights and whether that could improve the relationship between Strasbourg and here,"" Mr Clarke told the BBC. 'Improve relationship' The move follows a row over votes for prisoners and the sex offenders register. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the UK's blanket ban on prisoners voting is unlawful. In response, MPs voted to keep the ban. The House of Commons' decision is not binding, however, but could put pressure on ministers to go against the Strasbourg court's decision. The Supreme Court has recently ruled that sex offenders in England and Wales could appeal against having to register with the police for life. The UK court ruled that the lack of a review was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. ""We are considering the debate we had in the House of Commons and considering what the legal position is but everybody - the prime minister and everybody else - has said we will of course comply with the law,"" said Mr Clarke. ""It would be startling if we had a British government which said we aren't going to comply with legal judgements."" 'Range of opinions' But the justice secretary said questions remained over the way the European Court behaved and should be addressed. He said: ""How far does it go into things which legislators and national courts can determine? Are we certain that the court operates properly - it's got an enormous number of judges - could it handle its case load quicker?"" He said when the UK gets the chairmanship in November, it would take the lead in reforming the court and establishing the relationship between national courts, national parliaments and the European Court. However, Mr Clarke said, there was no question of Britain withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. He said: ""We're a coalition government with a range of opinions and we have a clearly negotiated policy. ""Only the Greek colonels have ever repudiated the convention on human rights.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Irish boy struck dumb by First Lady Michelle Obama,"The boy, named only as Billy, was dumbstruck with shyness when he met her backstage at the Gaiety Theatre. He was among scores of youngsters invited to the theatre for a special performance of Riverdance. Earlier, Mrs Obama and her daughters Malia and Sasha had visited Trinity College in the Irish capital. Rebecca Morgan, aged 11 and a pupil in Moneygall National School in County Offaly - US President Barack Obama's ancestral homeland - revealed her classmate's embarrassment. ""She is so beautiful and very tall,"" she said. ""She looks even prettier in real life than on TV. 'Like Hogwarts' ""A boy in my class was really embarrassed when she touched Billy's hand because he thinks she is so beautiful. He was so shy."" Before the performance of Riverdance began, Mrs Obama revealed her daughters' amazement during their visit to Trinity. ""I don't know if many of you have been there, it's like Hogwarts, as Sasha pointed out,"" she told the audience. Mrs Obama was introduced by Fionnuala Kenny, wife of Irish prime minister Enda Kenny, who himself admitted that he cries every time he watches Riverdance, the Irish dance spectacular. President Michael D Higgins' wife Sabina also attended the performance. Mrs Obama said it was very powerful to find out that two girls born on the south side of Chicago could trace their lineage back to the 1600s in rural Ireland. ""(The Long Room) was a huge room with shelf after shelf of books, a beautiful place, and I hope that all of you aspire to go there, if not study there but just to go there and experience what it is like to be surrounded by so much history and so much power,"" she said. Ancestors They also viewed the Book of Kells, a 9th Century gospel manuscript, and were shown the birth registry of their County Offaly ancestors and old maps detailing the family's library. Earlier on Monday, Mrs Obama addressed the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, as part of the US president's visit. She is visiting the Republic of Ireland as the president holds talks with other world leaders at the G8 summit in Fermanagh. The visit is the second time Mrs Obama has come to the Republic of Ireland in her role as First Lady. In 2011, she accompanied the president on engagements in Dublin and Moneygall, where they were met by large cheering crowds. Mr Obama has Irish ancestry and can trace his maternal great, great, great grandfather to the tiny County Offaly village. Falmouth Kearney, the son of a Moneygall shoemaker, emigrated to the United States in 1850 at the age of 19, at the height of Ireland's Great Famine.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pensioner liable for Donald Trump golf court expenses,"US tycoon Mr Trump hopes to build the ""world's greatest golf resort"" at Menie, north of Aberdeen. Molly Forbes, 86, raised judicial review proceedings at the Court of Session but has dropped her case. A judge has ruled Trump International Golf Links and Aberdeenshire Council were entitled to expenses. Lord Kinclaven said: ""On the information before me the appropriate course is to find the petitioner (Mrs Forbes) liable in expenses to date. ""There is no good reason for withholding that finding."" The judge said that the motions for an award by the local authority and golf developer were ""irresistible"". But he said the court did not have to pass decree for immediate payment and he was prepared to allow Mrs Forbes an opportunity to make further submissions on modification of her liability for expenses. Andrew Smith QC, for Mrs Forbes, earlier told the court: ""Mrs Forbes couldn't afford to meet any award of expenses."" 'Baseless claim' Trump International Scotland said in a statement: ""It is regrettable that an elderly woman has been used to front this frivolous court action. ""There are consequences for filing a baseless claim and her son and lawyers should pay the expenses."" A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council said: ""The court has fixed a further hearing for 11 January at which Mrs Forbes will be allowed to seek to have these expenses modified if her Legal Aid position has been resolved. ""The court has wide discretion regarding expenses and may modify her liability to nil, or otherwise limit the amount recoverable. ""Any decision on action to be taken by the council to enforce the award against Mrs Forbes before that hearing would therefore be premature."" Work on Mr Trump's golf course development got under way earlier this year. The billionaire has said the total cost of the project is likely to be about Â£750m. Some residents object to the plans, and have refused to sell their land. Many opponents of the development have bought a stake in a one-acre stretch of land at the heart of the resort site in a bid to disrupt it. As well as a championship golf course, the development includes a 450-room hotel, 950 holiday apartments and 500 residential homes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
City of Culture: Leicester 'disappointed but defiant',"A ""desperately disappointed"" Peter Soulsby congratulated Hull and said it perhaps needed the regeneration more. He said he had previously believed Leicester was not up for the bid but had been proved wrong in recent months. He said many of the planned events would happen anyway. ""We don't need to wait until 2017 to show ourselves off,"" Sir Peter said. ""We are going to do it now."" 'Best on earth' Sir Peter was speaking at a special ceremony at the Curve theatre in the city's Cultural Quarter. ""We here in Leicester are desperately disappointed. The first thing of course to do is congratulate Hull, we do wish them well for their year as City of Culture,"" he said. But he said there had always been a plan B which would see many of the events due to be put on during the City of Culture year of 2017 happen anyway. He also said the city had much to celebrate in the next couple of years with upcoming events including the opening of the Richard III museum and matches in the Rugby World Cup. ""I just think that perhaps, at the second time of trying, Hull were seen to demonstrate they were able to get a shot in the arm [from the City of Culture] that maybe Leicester doesn't need, in the opinion of the judges,"" Sir Peter said. ""We were saying 'yes, we are brilliant but we've got a long way to go'. I think [the judges] may have felt we can get there by other means."" Manjula Sood, assistant mayor and chairman of Leicester Council of Faiths, said she was in a ""state of disbelief"". ""Globally we are known as the best multicultural city on earth,"" she said. ""The people of Leicester will be very upset."" Martin Traynor from Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce denied losing out would hit the city's economy. ""We had great expectations of what it could bring [economically] but there is also an opportunity to build on what we have now got in the cultural events we are going to put forward,"" he said. ""It might not be as great as we were hoping for but I still think we can make a difference [to the economy].""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ex-officers rehired: Case studies,"The PSNI said the appropriate place to discuss the detail of the report was with the Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee. Here are some case studies taken from the report. CASE ONE Constable B retired in October 2001 after more than 20 years service. In early 2004 he was rehired as a transport assistant at a local PSNI station. He was responsible for ensuring vehicles were clean and in a roadworthy condition, were serviced regularly and were available for operational duties. He was initially employed for a 12-week period, described as a ""casual assignment"". The assignment ended seven and a half years later. CASE TWO Constable A retired from the PSNI in 2001. In mid-2004 he was temporarily re-employed as a porter/driver. His duties included receiving deliveries, moving furniture, removing rubbish, salting the complex in severe weather, removing health and safety hazards and other facilities management activities as required. The PSNI told the Audit Office it was planning a review of all such industrial grades and it was felt appropriate to retain the flexibility of a temporary resource. Constable A's assignment lasted for more than seven years. CASE THREE Superintendent F was re-employed shortly after his retirement. His skills were ""deemed vital"" to the continuity of the department in which he worked. He returned as a consultant on the same project that he had worked on prior to his severance, at a daily rate of Â£275. The PSNI procured his services through the means of a Direct Award contract (single tender action) for which there was no open competition, citing ""national security concerns"". CASE FOUR Inspector G left the PSNI in 2005 - and was re-employed a week later. His new title was systems and records manager, responsible for the integrity of the information on a HR system. The PSNI said: ""The complexity of the system and the sheer volume of leavers and new employees as well as the ongoing restructuring meant that PSNI judged it essential to retain the highest level of expertise at mangement level."" The assignment lasted over five and a half years, finishing in June 2011.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kent's festivals set to draw large crowds this summer,"By Andrew ParryBBC Kent In fact, we have more festivals than most down in the sunny south-east. From farms to parks, hills to zoos, no large space of land is safe from festival fever. Lounge on the Farm Festivals come and go, but the great Kent festival stalwart Lounge on the Farm (LOTF) returns for another year, with an outstanding line-up. LOTF manage the balance of local and international acts very well; over the weekend of 8 - 10 July you can see The Streets, Ellie Goulding and Everything Everything alongside Tunbridge Wells' Tom Williams & the Boat, Deal's Cocos Lovers and Canterbury's Zoo For You. Hevy, Port Lympne and Hop Farm If lounging on a farm in Canterbury isn't hardcore enough for you, try Hevy Music Festival at Port Lympne Animal Park, in Hythe, in August. Here you can see the cream of the metal and hardcore crop, including Dillinger Escape Plan and Funeral For a Friend. If big names and oast houses are your thing, then head to the Hop Farm Music Festival at the beginning of July. What must have been an incredibly expensive line-up to secure includes Prince, Eagles, Morrissey, Bryan Ferry, Brandon Flowers and Iggy & the Stooges. Music on the Hill and Unfest Music on the Hill in Kings Hill (24 - 26 June) offers a similar deal but with profits going to Demelza Hospice Care for Children and The Children's Development Trust.

Jersey States discussing local fish quotas,"Jersey currently works to the EU quota system, which restricts what can be caught in island waters. Deputy Carolyn Labey said the States were launching a consultation into marine resources, including the management of fishing quotas. She said it was not yet clear whether a change to the quota system would benefit the island's fishing industry. Part of the Marine Resources Consultation is to include talks with the UK over local stock management. She said: ""Initial discussions with the UK have been positive in respect of allowing the Island to manage quota at a local level, with the intention of ensuring sustainability but increasing fishing profitability. ""This work would be resource hungry and may not be able to deliver any further fishing opportunities to our fishermen than they enjoy under the current system,"" she said. Don Thomson, of the Jersey Fisherman's Association, wants fishermen to be able to control their own fishing quotas. He said: ""We have done some research, we are clear that our waters are not European waters and never were. ""It would be no surprise to anyone in Europe if Jersey declared fish stocks in our waters were managed by us in our own way."" Despite not being in the European Union, the island signed up to the EU fish quota system as part of an agreement with the UK over managing local fish stocks. Ms Labey said that: ""We agreed these quotas with the UK in 1996 because they help us manage local stocks and by making this agreement we were able to extend our territorial sea, with all the benefits that has brought."" Mr Thomson said if fishermen were to survive in the island they would need more government support. He claimed EU quotas had lost the island millions of pounds and had damaged its fishing fleet. Quotas limit the amount of wet fish - such as cod, bass and ray - boats can catch to protect fish stocks. Ms Labey said, once the consultation was complete, a strategy would be developed and would need approval at political level. She said areas being focussed on included helping fishermen with economic modelling, restricting unlicensed fishing and developing markets.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sunday Times Rich List suggests UK's wealthiest defy recession,"The newspaper's research found the combined worth of the country's 1,000 wealthiest people is Â£414bn, up 4.7%. It means their joint wealth has passed the level last seen in 2008, before the financial crash, to set a new record. Top spot for the eighth straight year is held by Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, 61, with Â£12.7bn. There are now 77 billionaires on the list, with individuals needing to have at least Â£72m to make the top 1,000. The richest billionaire of all, Mr Mittal, retains his position despite seeing 27% of his family fortune wiped out in the last 12 months because of a drop in the share price of their steel producing business. The Mittal family have held the number one spot in the list since 2005. Another person who has made money from the metal industry, Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov, is second with Â£12.3bn, while Chelsea owner and oil baron Roman Abramovich is third with Â£9.5bn, despite being Â£800m down on last year. The richest woman is former Miss UK Kirsty Bertarelli, who shares a Â£7.4bn fortune with her husband Ernesto, while the Duke of Westminster's property portfolio makes him worth Â£7.3bn. Several leading British entrepreneurs, who are further down the list, have seen their wealth increase this year. Diamond retailer Laurence Graff's wealth has risen to Â£3,300m while Sir Anthony Bamford, owner of the JCB earth-moving machinery firm, has seen his fortune go up to Â£3,150m. Inventor Sir James Dyson, who created the bagless vacuum cleaner, has also seen his wealth increase, to Â£2,650m. Some of Britain's best-known performers and artists have also seen their fortunes improve. Sir Paul McCartney's recent marriage to his third wife Nancy Shevell, who is the daughter of an American trucking magnate, sees him become the third wealthiest man in British music, as their combined wealth is now rated at Â£665m. The two people surpassing him are music executive Clive Calder, who is worth Â£1,350m, and theatre owner and producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, whose fortune has gone up to Â£725m. Harry Potter creator JK Rowling's worth has risen by Â£30m in the last year to Â£560m, putting her 148th on the list, and a new addition to the list is London-based founder of the Spotify music website Daniel Ek, ranked 395th with a fortune of Â£190m - the same amount as David and Victoria Beckham.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'500 killed' due to medicine shortage,"In a letter to the Secretary of Health Ministry, Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi say that the region was not provided with much needed medicine for the last four months. ""Thousands of civilian deaths could have gone unrecorded as they were not brought to hospitals,"" the letter signed by Dr. T Varatharaja and Dr. T Satyamoorthy said. Government response The bulk of the medicine supplies that arrived in Vavuniya, it said, is ""awaiting security clearance from the ministry of defence"". ""In fact, less than five percent of the combined quota of drugs and dressings that are meant for the last quarter of last year and for the first quarter of this year have been sent to us, so far,"" the doctors informed health authorities. However, the government says that enough supplies have been sent to Vanni through ICRC ships that transport wounded and send food and medicine to Vanni. Military spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara told BBC Sandeshaya that the two doctors in Vanni should take measures to send wounded to government controlled areas. ""Even yesterday 480 patients were brought by the ICRC,"" he said. ICRC spokeswoman in Colombo, Sophie Romanens told BBC Sandeshaya that the MoD gave security clearance to transport medicine on three occasions since February this year. âBut it was not sufficient for the increasing need,â she added. The ICRC has evacuated over 4000 people from Vanni since 10 February and nearly two thirds of those evacuated are sick and wounded, Sophie Romanens said. Food arrives The World Food Programme (WFP), meanwhile, said that 500 metric tonnes of mixed food commodities reached Puthumathalan on Tuesday. The food items sent mainly included rice, wheat flour, lentils, sugar and vegetable oil, a statement issued by the WFP said. There was no mention of medicine. ""The food sent to the area will be sufficient to feed approximately 100,000 Internally Displaced Persons for a period of 10 days,"" it added. The two health officials in Vanni have urged the authorities to immediately send medicine to the region. ""Any further delay in sending essential medicines would only cause more and more deaths of innocent civilians,"" they warned.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
University of Nottingham rent protesters offered 'support package',"Hundreds of University of Nottingham students called for rents to be suspended when they were unable to return due to national restrictions. Now the university has said support will be available to some students. Nottingham Trent University (NTU), which has also seen protests, said it was awaiting further government advice. As part of the package, the University of Nottingham said any students ""who are not studying on a programme that currently allows them to return for in-person teaching and are not using their room"" will not have to pay accommodation fees from the start of term on 10 January up to their return ""or the projected re-start of in-person teaching"" on 13 February. However, students who study ""courses that have been advised by government to return for in-person teaching"" or those who return before 14 February ""will be liable for their full accommodation fees"". Though the relief package only covers students staying in halls owned or leased and managed by the university, it said it was ""liaising with private and third-party accommodation providers to see if they are able to support students in a similar manner"". 'Fair for students' Organisers of rent strike protests say about 15,000 students across England have pledged to withhold rent on university accommodation they cannot use during the current lockdown. Students at NTU have called for no-penalty contract releases at halls of residence and for deposits to be fully refunded. An NTU spokesman said the rent concerns ""arise directly from decisions taken by government"", adding Universities UK was discussing the situation with politicians ""and we judge it is sensible to await the announcement of the government's position"". ""The government needs to show leadership to find a solution that is fair to all students,"" he said. ""At NTU, only a minority of our students are in accommodation operated by or on behalf of the university. ""We do not want a repeat of the situation in the summer term of 2020 where most of our students were reliant on the goodwill of private accommodation providers who did not always do the right thing.""

Covid anxiety: Child 'asking if he's going to die',"By Sarah EasedaleBBC Wales news Jane Griffiths, 47, said her four children had all been affected by the stress of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as research for a children's charity showed more than half of children believe their parents are worried about making Christmas nice. More than a third were worried about getting Covid-19 and dying. Of the 1,000 children asked, 47% said they were experiencing anxiety. Ms Griffiths, from Connah's Quay in Flintshire, said her children's stress increased after her husband Deion lost his job at the local paper mill and money became tight. ""My husband was laid off and we weren't entitled to furlough because he was with an agency,"" she said. ""It has been difficult... you have to cut back and not take the children to as many places. ""They know they won't get the same [for Christmas]. ""Christmas is all about family anyway. That's the main thing."" How is Covid anxiety affecting children? Brigitte Gater, director of Action for Children Wales which conducted the research with YouGov, said the pandemic has plunged new families into poverty. ""Where children were used to seeing their parents going to work, that new wave of parents are spending their first Christmas on Universal Credit and really struggling with making ends meet,"" she said. ""Making sure that there's toys, presents, Christmas is going to be ok, at the same time as utilities, rent having to be paid, so there's a lot of anxiety about eviction and borrowing money over this time, just to make it a nice time for children. ""Some of the parents we surveyed said that if they could, they would cancel Christmas this year."" Father Dominic Cawdell, of St Peter's Church in Holywell, runs a weekly food club where people can buy up to 15 items for Â£2 and helps find Christmas presents for children. He said people were ""anxious about getting sick, they're anxious about their children getting sick, they're anxious about their finances because many people who only work occasionally or whose work isn't particularly secure haven't been able to take advantage of government schemes"". ""Children are amazingly perceptive and they pick up on their parents' anxieties... it's even bigger for them, they don't understand it, they just know their whole world has changed,"" he added. One of the food club customers, Anita Igbinoba who has two young daughters, said there was a lot of worry in her household after her job in a holiday camp ended. ""Panicking, pressure, children asking... I can't get them as much, they feel the anxiety and the pressure of it. It is upsetting really,"" she said.

Power at Fukushima nuclear fuel ponds restored,"A power cut shut down cooling systems for four spent fuel ponds at reactors 1, 3 and 4 on Monday evening, although cooling to the reactors themselves was not affected. All cooling systems were operational by early Wednesday morning, Tepco said. Pool temperatures remained within safe levels throughout, it added. Cooling at the spent fuel ponds at reactors 1, 3 and 4 were all restored by 22:43 local time (14:43 GMT on Tuesday). The cooling system at the fourth, common, pond was restored at 00:12 on Wednesday, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said. 'Faulty switchboard' The cause of the power failure was still being investigated, as Tepco had made restoring power the priority, spokesman Masayuki Ono said, according to Kyodo news agency. A faulty power switchboard could have caused the power outage, Mr Ono said. He added that it was the first time so many facilities had been affected by electrical failure at the same time since the plant was brought under control in December 2011. Restarting cooling to the spent fuel pool at reactor 4 had been of particular urgency for Tepco as it had the highest number of fuel assemblies stored there, Kyodo news agency reported. The company has been criticised for its delay in announcing the incident, which began at 18:57 on Monday. It took Tepco three hours to announce that the cooling systems had been shut down. The ponds store spent fuel from the nuclear reactors. They cool the fuel - which generates intense heat - and provide shielding from radiation. The spent fuel remains in the ponds for a year or more. There was no immediate threat of a radiation release. But if cooling systems had not been restored, it is possible that the water in the ponds could have started to boil. That could have led to a loss of water and eventually to the exposure of the spent fuel rods to air, releasing radiation. On 11 March 2011, an earthquake and tsunami crippled the plant. Waves knocked out cooling systems to the reactors, leading to meltdowns at three of them. Engineers have since stabilised the plant but years of work lie ahead to fully contain the disaster and tackle its effects. Tens of thousands of evacuees remain unable to return home.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Demon dog Black Shuck celebrated in graphic novel,"By Nic RigbyBBC News, East Mark Allard-Will is writing the book about Black Shuck - who is said to have terrorised churchgoers in Bungay and Blythburgh, Suffolk, in 1577. The legend has been celebrated by rock band The Darkness with their song Black Shuck and inspired Sherlock Holmes novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to create the Hound of the Baskervilles. Allard-Will, who was born in Suffolk, has launched a crowdfunding campaign in a bid to fund the book The Burning Black: Legend of Black Shuck. The East Anglian legend recounts how on 4 August 1577, during a dry lightning storm, Black Shuck broke down the doors of Bungay's St Mary's Church, resulting in the deaths of four worshippers, and then vanished. The animal then reappeared in Blythburgh, where what are said to be Shuck's claw marks can still be seen, burned in to the surface of the doors to the Holy Trinity Church. Allard-Will, who is working with artist Ryan Howe, told the BBC: ""What I'm doing is something that I feel is going to be special for history buffs, folklore fans and just Suffolk folk in general that want an entertaining read. ""I'm not just giving the audience a recount of events of that night, instead I'm giving readers my idea of what a back story could possibly be for Black Shuck and then extending that out in a very slightly dramatised version of the events. ""So I really am giving readers a fully fleshed out three-act story."" He said the hardest part of writing the book was making sure his research into clothing, housing, technology and settlement types of both the Dark Ages and Tudor era was as accurate as possible. ""Because the story is in a visual medium, there's no hiding research errors, it will show if I've failed to be thorough,"" he said. Allard-Will, who previously wrote the Arkade graphic novel, was born and raised in Suffolk until he was 26 when he left to live in Canada. He said if everything went to plan the book could be published in April 2019. He is appearing at comic convention Suffolk Super Con, which is taking place at The Apex in Bury St Edmunds on Saturday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Macedonia parliament votes to start name change process,"Two-thirds of the chamber - 80 of 120 deputies - backed the start of the process, the requisite majority to start the move. Several more votes will follow before the switch is confirmed. In June, the country reached a deal with Greece on the name after 27 years of talks. Greece had vetoed Macedonia's bids to join Nato and the European Union, fearing claims on its northern region of the same name. The country said it would no longer block such moves if the name change went ahead. Greece must also back the name change should Macedonia formally change its constitution. Remarkable revival for a process on life support By Guy Delaunay, BBC Balkans correspondent This vote may not guarantee that Macedonia will eventually become North Macedonia. But it does go a long way to reversing the damage caused by last month's referendum. More than 90% of those who voted then were in favour of the name change. But a successful boycott campaign kept the turnout well below the 50% threshold which would have made parliamentary votes a formality. Now eight members of the party behind the boycott - VMRO-DPMNE - have joined forces with the governing coalition to create the two-thirds majority necessary to start the process of constitutional changes. A process which had been on life support now seems remarkably healthy. It is not clear how the government brought the VMRO MPs on board. Numerous members are facing criminal charges from the party's increasingly corrupt decade in power. The road to becoming North Macedonia still looks bumpy. There will be more votes in the coming weeks before constitutional changes can be confirmed - and the Greek parliament still has to ratify the deal. Defence minister Panos Kammenos has vowed to withdraw his small right-wing party from the governing coalition in opposition. Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had vowed to push ahead with the change after a referendum last month was rendered invalid owing to low turnout. Contention over the name dates back to 1991, when Macedonia declared independence during the break-up of Yugoslavia. The present-day country and the region in north Greece were both part of a Roman province called Macedonia. Both claim the heritage of Alexander the Great. Raw memories from Bulgaria's occupation of the Greek region and Yugoslav Macedonia in World War Two also play a role in the debate. Greece's objections forced the UN to refer to the new country as ""the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". Athens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its efforts at EU membership. If the constitutional change is eventually approved and the country adds the word ""north"", Macedonia could see those ambitions realised.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What has the UK accomplished in Afghanistan?,"By Caroline WyattDefence correspondent, BBC News This has been the case since George Bush declared America's mission in Iraq over, under a banner bearing those words, just before the killing there began in earnest. So what was the UK's mission in Afghanistan? In 2001, in response to the 9/11 attacks, it was to stop Afghanistan harbouring Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and any group that wished to attack the west. Under that narrow definition of ""security"", the mission could be argued to have succeeded, although the threat itself has moved elsewhere, while Osama bin Laden was killed in his hideaway in Pakistan. However, the mission in Afghanistan expanded to the fight against drugs and the attempt to eradicate the opium poppy harvest, which is now more productive than ever. It also grew to encompass helping to liberate Afghan women, and achieve more equality across the south of the country by ensuring that girls, too, went to school. More children - both boys and girls - do indeed now go to school in Afghanistan. And for many, life and employment prospects have improved. But the fight against the Taliban continues almost unabated, even as the west tries to encourage the Afghan government to hold meaningful peace talks with the insurgents. We hear less about it because it is the Afghan police and army who are bearing the brunt of this fight now, while UK and American forces scale back. Afghanistan itself is still riddled with corruption, inefficiency and divisions, while poverty is endemic and the drug dependent economy - or narco-economy - is now stronger than it was in 2001. Fighting continues in many areas, even though the Afghan security forces are undoubtedly stronger than they were in 2001, and more capable. But what happens after western forces leave is a question nobody, least of all in Afghanistan, can answer. The country will hold a presidential election in April, and much will depend on that new government, and what legacy President Karzai leaves behind - and whether Afghanistan will sign a deal with US and other forces to help with security after 2014. For the UK's part, the coalition government has sought to narrow the scale of its stated ambitions for Afghanistan as it promised to withdraw British combat troops by the end of 2014, along with the rest of NATO's remaining combat forces. Mr Cameron may have veered off script on Monday evening by echoing the words ""mission accomplished"" while answering journalists' questions, but he was very clear that what happens next will be up to the Afghans themselves.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New prostate therapy recommended on NHS,"It's called prostate artery embolisation. And it blocks some of the blood supply to the prostate using tiny synthetic beads, causing the troublesome tissue to shrink and die. Officials say there is good evidence that the non-invasive treatment works. And it can spare men surgery and side-effects, such as impotence. Enlarged prostate More than a third of men over the age of 50 have an enlarged prostate, which can make if difficult for them to pass urine. Drugs or an operation can help, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says men should now be offered another treatment option. PAE can be done under local anaesthetic as a day case, meaning patients can go home shortly afterwards without having to be admitted to hospital, unlike conventional prostate surgery. Doctors pass a small tube into an artery in the groin that can be guided into the small blood vessels of the prostate. About 20 centres in the UK have already been offering the treatment as part of a trial. Dr Nigel Hacking, consultant interventional radiologist at University Hospital Southampton, said: ""It is a particularly good option for men who are not yet ready to undergo more invasive prostate surgery. Maintaining sexual function and fertility is one of its main strengths. ""I hope with NICE's recommendations released today, that more centres will be able to introduce PAE services in the not too distant future."" The NICE advice is for England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can choose to implement it too. In 2016, NICE also recommended another prostate treatment - a laser therapy that can vaporise the overgrown tissue. The prostate The prostate gland is part of a man's reproductive system, and its job is to make the fluid to carry and nurture sperm. An enlarged prostate - known as BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - is very common, particularly as men get older, and will not always need treating. Left untreated, it can get in the way of emptying the bladder, meaning you have to go to the toilet more often or need to strain to pass urine. In the long term, this could potentially cause other problems such as urine infections or damage to the bladder or kidneys.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump petition: Areas most opposed to US President's visit,"By Daniel WainwrightBBC News The petition on the Parliament website passed one million signatures earlier and will now be debated by MPs. It came amid mounting protest to the President's clampdown on immigration to the United States. Constituencies with the most signatures were in London, apart from Bristol West and Brighton Pavilion. As of 10:00 GMT the single largest number of signatures came from voters in the Bristol West constituency. At that point there were more than 6,600 signatures, equivalent to 5% of people in the constituency. But it has since climbed to above 7,700. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Islington North constituency and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's Hackney North and Stoke Newington were also in the top 10. Mr Corbyn has called for Mr Trump's state visit to be postponed. However, Downing Street insisted the visit would go ahead and said the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US allows for ""frank conversations at all times"". Mr Trump is expected to visit the UK and be hosted by the Queen later this year after being invited by Prime Minister Theresa May. Constituencies in Northern Ireland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar in the Outer Hebrides were among those with the lowest number of signatories. In England, Walsall North in the West Midlands accounted for just 430 signatures as of 10:00. For more stories from the BBC England Data Unit follow our Pinterest board The petition had five times as many signatures as any other open on the Parliament website at the point it exceeded a million names. However, it still has a long way to go before it passes a petition calling for a second EU referendum. After signatures from the UK, the next highest number of names came from the United States, more than 5,000 of the total. All but about 30,000 signatures were from the UK. BBC News took a snapshot of the petition at about 10:00 GMT, just as it reached one million signatures. Since then the number of people signing it has continued to grow and the petition will stay open until 29 May.

China and US 'agree North Korea nuclear test measures',"Unnamed diplomats said a deal was agreed late on Monday and they hoped a draft resolution would be put to the Security Council on Tuesday. The details of what has been agreed have not been announced. North Korea carried out its third and most powerful nuclear test in February, sparking worldwide condemnation. On Tuesday, North Korea threatened to scrap a 60-year armistice with South Korea. The country's military said it would end the truce this month, if the South continued annual military exercises with the US which began on Friday. The Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953 - not a peace treaty - meaning the peninsula is still technically at war. Similar threats have been made before by the North, which sees the military exercises and pressure over its nuclear programme as acts of aggression. 'Tough talks' February's nuclear test was the first of its kind under new leader Kim Jong-un, who took over the leadership after his father Kim Jong-il died in December 2011. Pyongyang said the test was a ""self-defensive measure"" made necessary by the ""continued hostility"" of the US. Nuclear test monitors based in Vienna say the underground explosion had double the force of the last test, in 2009, despite the use of a device said by the North to be smaller. North Korea claimed that a ""miniaturised"" device had been tested, increasing fears that Pyongyang had moved closer to building a warhead small enough to arm a missile. The test came weeks after Pyongyang successfully used a rocket to put a satellite into space, a move condemned by the UN as a banned test of missile technology. China is North Korea's only ally and its major trading partner. Beijing has been reluctant to support tougher sanctions in the past, citing the impact of potential instability inside its secretive neighbour state. With the recent test, however, its stance appears to have changed somewhat. A UN diplomat told AFP there had been ""tough talks"" between China and the US on the issue and that a vote on the draft would happen ""soon"", though it was unlikely to be at Tuesday's session. Another diplomat told Reuters that whether a draft was circulated on Tuesday was ""up to the Americans"". The UN press office said Russia, which this month holds the presidency at the Security Council, would hold closed-doors talks on Tuesday morning. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions affecting individuals and government bodies, restricting financial activities and barring any trade or test of ballistics and nuclear technology.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Removing school bus chaperones in Birmingham 'dangerous',"Some pupils who used the free council bus service with guides to the Wilson Stuart School in Birmingham were told they did not need it. Parent Heidi Wells said her 15-year-old disabled son could choke on his saliva without a chaperone on the bus. Birmingham City Council said it prioritised children with the greatest need for a guide. About 24 of the school's pupils, on three bus routes, were told in a letter about the changes three days before the Erdington school, which caters for pupils with physical disabilities and complex medical needs, started in September, Mrs Wells said. Her son Jack has cerebral palsy, and condition dysphagia, which causes him to choke on his own saliva. She said without the guide he had last year to keep an eye on him during his journey to and from school, he could be in danger. ""The council have cut it because of cost,"" she said. ""I have had no explanation."" She added her son was now regularly late to school because she needed to drive Jack herself - as well as dropping his siblings off at other schools - because it was too dangerous to catch an unguided bus. Tanya Cleaver said her five-year-old daughter with cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease was also denied a guide on the bus, despite having one previously. The council said she would now get a guide on the bus from Friday. Ms Cleaver said: ""It is all right saying 'if there's an emergency the driver will pull over and stop', but that will be too late for children like Nadine or Jack."" Wilson Stuart executive head teacher Steve Hughes said the council had not consulted them about removing guides from some pupils. School governor and Conservative shadow cabinet member for children's wellbeing, Councillor Alex Yip, said: ""We want to know, have they done risk assessments for the children, and why was there four days' notice and no consultation?"" In September special education needs provision for pupils and young people across Birmingham was described as ""weak"" by Ofsted. A Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said it had responded to all concerns raised. It said annually reviewed travel routes pupils who qualify for assistance and, where necessary independent ,occupational therapy assessments are undertaken. She said: ""We have a finite number of guides and will always prioritise routes where the children have complex care needs that require the support of a guide.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rain in February. Meteorologists say they are amazed at the sudden switch from extreme wet to extreme dry â it is not ""British"" weather. On average the UK gets 436 hours of sunshine between March and the end of May. Since 1929, only 10 years have had more than 500 hours. And none has got more than 555 hours. Scientists say the recent weather in the UK has been unprecedented and astounding. This year we've bathed in an extraordinary 626 hours - smashing the previous record by a âstaggeringâ amount, one Met Office worker said. It is because the jet stream has locked the fine weather in place, just as it locked the previous winter rainfall in place. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC News: âWeâve swung from a really unsettled spell with weather systems coming in off the Atlantic to a very, very settled spell. âItâs unprecedented to see such a swing from one extreme to the other in such a short space of time. Thatâs what concerns me. We donât see these things normally happening with our seasons. âItâs part of a pattern where weâre experiencing increasingly extreme weather as the climate changes.â Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, said: âIf we look at the difference in rainfall thatâs fallen over the winter compared to spring it is the largest difference in rainfall amount in our national series from 1862. âThe sunshine statistics are really astounding. âThe stand out is by how much sunshine has broken the previous record - set in 1948. Thereâs been more sunshine than most of our past summer seasons. It's quite remarkable."" One of his colleagues described the figures as ""absolutely staggering"". The Met Office says this year is not an indicator of the future, because the jet stream might behave differently. Scientists suspect man-made climate change may be implicated, but it is too soon to tell. Some of them believe the rapid man-made heating of the Arctic, which has led to record temperatures and wildfires in Siberia, may be influencing the jet stream, although that is not proven. Professor Joe Smith, chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, told BBC News: ""For many people, the recent long sunny spell is simply 'nice weather'. ""In a wider context itâs a signal of the increasing unpredictability of the UKâs climate. Planning for the growing season is starting to resemble a night at the gambling tables. âThe fact remains that bold early actions to slash emissions can still cut the larger risks associated with climate change in the UK and around the worldâ.

Child sex abuse live streams loophole to be closed,"It has proposed that live video streams of abuse should be punished in the same way that recorded clips already are. It would mean that people who broadcast such footage would face up to 14 years in jail. In the past, offenders have sometimes been given lighter sentences if the authorities could not prove a recording was made. The plan was announced as part of the Queen's Speech, in which the the government set out its legislative programme for the year ahead. The change is relevant to a loophole in England and Wales' legal system, but not Northern Ireland or Scotland's. Tougher sentences The live streaming of child sexual abuse over the internet is a growing problem, according to a report published by the EU's law enforcement agency Europol last year. ""The popularisation of webcams and chat platforms that enable the streaming of live images and video has led to their exploitation by child sexual abusers,"" it said. ""Some applications allow users to upgrade their accounts by paying a fee, guaranteeing access to extended features such as broadcasts protected by passwords and extra layers of anonymity. ""It is a crime that is hard to detect and investigate since the offenders do not usually store a copy of the streamed material."" The report noted that much of the activity involved children filmed in deprived economies, typically Eastern Asia. However, there have been prosecutions involving cases in the UK. In 2013, a teacher working in Birmingham and two accomplices were arrested after broadcasting live footage of sexual abuse involving a 15-year-old girl. The teacher, William Hanna, was subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of three charges of sexual activity with a child and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life. Because there was no evidence that footage of the abuse had been recorded, he could not be prosecuted for a related offence of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, as defined by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The change to the law would give the Crown Prosecution Service the ability to seek such a conviction for other live video stream creators in the future. ""The horrors of this kind of abuse were highlighted in a recent court case where sexual assaults against babies were being streamed for paedophiles to watch,"" commented a spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children charity. ""A crackdown on this sickening type of crime is a positive step. But sex offenders will always be looking for ways to harm children, so while this will close one loophole we must be vigilant to ensure others do not open in its place."" The government also set out plans to introduce sanctions for professionals who fail to try to stop child abuse where it is their duty to act, as part of a new Policing and Criminal Justice Bill.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump aide Michael Flynn Jnr out after 'Pizzagate' tweets,"Michael Flynn, 33, left the US president-elect's transition team on Tuesday following his tweets about the so-called Pizzagate fake news story. His father, Michael Flynn Snr, Mr Trump's pick to be US national security adviser, has also shared viral hoaxes. The Pizzagate claims led to a gunman firing shots in a restaurant on Sunday. No one was injured in the incident at Comet Ping Pong in Washington DC. The suspect told police he had turned up to ""self-investigate"" online rumour-mongering that the pizzeria was the nexus of a paedophile ring involving Hillary Clinton and one of her aides, John Podesta. The bizarre and unfounded theory had been spread online by right-wing blogs. The allegations were also circulated by Mr Flynn Jr, who tweeted after Sunday's gunfire that Pizzagate would remain a story until ""proven to be false"". The New York Times reports that he was fired from the Trump transition team on Tuesday but, according to CBS News, he resigned before he was sacked. The Trump team confirmed the departure of Mr Flynn - who had reportedly been given a .gov email address - but did not confirm it was related to the tweets. Vice President-elect Mike Pence acknowledged that Mr Flynn Jnr had been helping his father with scheduling and administrative items during the transition but said ""that's no longer the case"". Asked repeatedly whether a security clearance was requested, Mr Pence refused to answer directly. Mr Flynn Snr, 57, has also tweeted out outlandish conspiracy theories accusing Mrs Clinton and her aides of child-sex trafficking. Among the retired lieutenant general's other tweets was an allegation that President Barack Obama was a ""jihadi"" who ""laundered"" money for terrorists. Critics have said Mr Flynn Snr is unfit to advise the incoming president on the veracity of national security threats facing the US. In Sunday's armed confrontation, the suspect allegedly walked into Comet Ping Pong and pointed a rifle at an employee before firing shots into the ground. Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, from North Carolina, has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon. The Pizzagate theory originated on alternative message board 4chan, based on emails hacked from the Democratic Party and leaked by Wikileaks. The restaurant's owner, James Alefantis, a Democratic Party donor, appears in the emails in relation to organising a Democratic fundraiser. Users of 4chan and another message board, Reddit, had said words in the emails such as cheese, hot dog, and pizza were code for young children and sex acts.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Yardie actor on Idris Elba proposal: I had tears in my eyes,"By Hannah MooreNewsbeat reporter The 21-year-old has said he was already overwhelmed with emotion to be at the screening of Yardie - and that's before Idris made a surprise proposal to his girlfriend.

""Yardie was the first screening I've ever been to,"" said Adnan, from south London. ""Idris came on stage and thanked everybody for their hard work. He called his now fiancee on to the stage and thanked her for being part of the journey with him, and then he proposed."" Yardie is Idris' debut as a director, and the screening at Rio cinema in Dalston was for the cast and crew. ""I was already emotional because I was about to see myself on screen, but that made me even more emotional,"" said Adnan. ""We all stood up and clapped. I'm grateful I was there to witness it. It was such a beautiful moment. And that set the tone throughout the whole film for me. ""The lights went out and I already had tears in my eyes. Sabrina was so happy."" The film tells how a young Jamaican makes it from the streets of London to the top of the drug-dealing underworld. Adnan plays Engin, a 'wannabe bad boy', who like him is British-Turkish. ""I've been acting professionally for about a year now. But this was the first time I auditioned for somebody I could relate to, somebody who came from the same place as me. ""I grew up in south London, where acting wasn't really accessible for me."" Adnan says he never planned on becoming an actor, and can't believe he has had this opportunity. ""It's been an amazing experience, being directed by Idris Elba. And because he's also an actor, he knows what help to give us. ""After the screening we all went to a private venue, celebrated the film, and the proposal.

Officials probe Missouri governor for 'blackmail and assault',"The spurned ex-husband of the woman, who has not been named in reports, secretly recorded her describing the otherwise consensual encounter. On Thursday, the man added that Mr Greitens had ""slapped her"" after she told him she had slept with her own husband. The Republican governor has admitted to being ""unfaithful"" but denies the rest. A lawyer for the man, who has also not been named due to privacy concerns, claimed on Thursday that Mr Greitens had slapped his ex-wife during a 2015 encounter in hospital while the former Navy Seal's wife was giving birth. ""When she admitted that she'd had sexual relations with her husband during a period of reconciliation, that the governor slapped her,"" lawyer Albert Watkins told CBS News. James Bennett, a lawyer that Mr Greitens says he hired without using state funds, called the allegations ""completely false"". ""It never happened. There was never any violence. Anything reported otherwise is untrue and we will explore pursuing all legal action,"" he told US media as the new allegation was revealed. He added that the claims are ""being advanced by political adversaries"". On Thursday, the circuit attorney for the city of St Louis launched a criminal investigation into the governor's alleged actions.

""If anyone has any information related to this matter, I encourage them to contact my office immediately."" The Missouri statehouse was rocked by the admission on Wednesday that the governor had had an extra-marital affair, and the claim he had taken nude images of his mistress without her consent. The woman, who was reportedly the hairdresser for Mr Greitens, told her husband in the recording that said she ""saw a flash through the blindfold and he said, 'You're never going to mention my name"".

Jimmy Carr faces crowd after tax furore,"Carr has been widely condemned for taking part in a tax avoidance scheme. In response to a heckler who called him a ""tax dodger"", he replied: ""I've got to take that, I'm afraid. I've been dishing it out for years."" On taking to the stage at the Stockport Plaza, he said he had had ""a busy week"" but wanted to perform a normal routine. ""The thing I wanted to say right at the top of the gig was I've been in the papers all week,"" he told the crowd at the first of two shows at the venue on Friday. ""It obviously produces gags, that's my job. But how about I just do a show for you. What do you think?"" he added to cheers. As the show went on, references to the controversy were peppered throughout the routine, both by Carr himself and members of the crowd. During a section where he talked to audience members, he exchanged banter with a man who gave his job as a tax inspector, while he started another segment of his ""thoughts"" with: ""Number one - get a new accountant."" 'Take my medicine' At a different point, the comedian said he would ""take my medicine"" because he had made a mistake. Finishing the show, Carr thanked the audience and said how nervous he had been beforehand and that he was humbled by the reaction. BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson said: ""It was definitely a warm crowd. The heckling was not vicious - it was good natured. No-one debated with him. There were only smart alec comments. ""He seemed quite emotional at the end. He was quite contrite."" The gig comes a day after Carr said he ""made a terrible error of judgement"" by using the K2 tax avoidance scheme. He has now ended his involvement in it. A day earlier, Prime Minister David Cameron called Carr's use of the arrangement ""morally wrong"". The K2 tax scheme used by Carr is a way of lowering the amount of tax paid. It is legal and Mr Carr made clear in his statement it was fully disclosed to tax authorities. In a series of messages on Twitter Carr said it was ""obviously a serious matter"" and would ""conduct my financial affairs much more responsibly"" in the future. More than 1,000 people, including Carr, are thought to be using the Jersey-based K2 scheme, which is said to be sheltering Â£168m a year from the Treasury. The latest episode of Carr's TV panel show Eight Out Of Ten Cats was broadcast on Friday. In response to a jibe from fellow comedian Sean Lock, he said: ""I've been dishing it out for years, it's about time I got some."" He added: ""I hate to sound like I'm passing the buck, but I'll tell you who I blame for this whole mess - me. It's entirely my fault.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Files released on 1974 'Welsh Roswell',"There was a huge bang and a brilliant light over the Berwyn Mountains in north east Wales, and there were later claims a spaceship crash was concealed. Comparisons were drawn with Roswell, New Mexico, USA, in 1947, where it is claimed an alien crash was concealed. But a Ministry of Defence (MoD) investigation said there was no UFO. The National Archives files show it was explained by a noisy earth tremor coinciding with a meteor burning up in the atmosphere. A search and rescue team was scrambled from RAF Valley on Anglesey, but found no wreckage on the mountainside. The MoD investigation found that there were five other reports of UFOs seen over the UK at about 10pm on 23 January 1974, when the Berwyn Mountains incident happened. Three sightings were in the Home Counties, one in Lincolnshire and another in Sussex. Witnesses reported seeing a bright light in the north west which seemed to fall towards the horizon. An expert who undertook independent research into the Berwyn Mountains incident for the British Astronomical Society reported that a ""fireball"" was visible over most of the UK that night. Sightings were received from Somerset, Norfolk, Manchester and Edinburgh, the files notes. The fireball descended from about 120km in the sky to about 35km before disintegrating over Manchester, the expert found. Brynmor John, who was then junior RAF minister, explained the official position in a letter to Dafydd Elis Thomas, then a local MP, in May 1974. Mr John wrote: ""As suggested by the descriptions reported, it seems the phenomena could well have been caused by a meteor descending through the atmosphere burning up and finally disintegrating before it reached the ground. ""Such a hypothesis would also explain the absence of any signs of impact. ""It has also been suggested that at 8.32pm that evening there was an earth tremor in the Berwyn Mountains which produced a landslide with noises like detonation. ""The latter aspect is however outside the field of this department,"" Mr John added. But the MoD's conclusions did not convince all those who witnessed the ""Welsh Roswell"". The files also include a letter from one local who wrote: ""That 'something"" came down in the Berwyn Mountains on that night I am certain.

Amnesty calls for GCHQ spying inquiry,"It said it was ""outrageous"" that human rights bodies were being monitored. It came after the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) informed Amnesty that GCHQ had breached rules by keeping data intercepted from it for too long - although it had been collected legally. The IPT was revising an earlier ruling that had failed to name Amnesty. The tribunal had said in June that GCHQ failed to delete data intercepted from two other rights groups on time. But it confirmed on Thursday that it was mistaken, and that one of the groups was Amnesty. In a letter to the claimants in the case, IPT president Sir Michael Burton said: ""The Tribunal wishes to apologise for and correct an error in its Determination of 22 June 2015."" Communication interception The original action was brought by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) including Liberty, Privacy International, American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty and Bytes For All - who accused the intelligence agencies of intercepting their communications. In most of the cases there was no determination given - implying the bodies were not spied on, or if they were no rules were breached. But the IPT ruled that GCHQ had not followed proper internal procedures in the cases of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and South Africa-based The Legal Resources Centre. The tribunal has now made it clear that it was Amnesty and not the Egyptian organisation that had been spied on. 'Denials and subterfuge' Amnesty secretary general Salil Shetty said: ""It's outrageous that what has been often presented as being the domain of despotic rulers has been done on British soil, by the British government. ""How can we be expected to carry out our crucial work around the world if human rights defenders and victims of abuse can now credibly believe their confidential correspondence with us is likely to end up in the hands of governments? ""After 18 months of litigation and all the denials and subterfuge that entailed, we now have confirmation that we were in fact subjected to UK government mass surveillance. ""The revelation that the UK government has been spying on Amnesty International highlights the gross inadequacies in the UK's surveillance legislation."" He continued: ""If they hadn't stored our communications for longer than they were allowed to, we would never even have known. What's worse, this would have been considered perfectly lawful."" At the time of the original judgement the government said it welcomed ""the IPT's confirmation that any interception by GCHQ in these cases was undertaken lawfully and proportionately"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Oculus anti-piracy update cracked in a day,"The update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device. It also breaks an unofficial patch called Revive that lets Oculus-only games run on rival devices. But Revive's creator found he could disable digital rights management (DRM) in Oculus titles completely to keep the patch working. That also stops software from verifying it has been legally purchased, paving the way for pirates to copy Oculus games. Technological blockades ""DRM as a means to prevent piracy is rather futile,"" said Ernesto Van der Sar, founder of news website TorrentFreak. ""If there's a demand to use a product or access a service, people will often find a way around DRM and other technological blockades. ""History has shown many examples of how it mostly inconveniences legitimate customers."" Facebook-owned Oculus has invested in exclusive software titles to encourage people to buy its virtual reality headset over competing devices. The Revive patch, created by Libre VR, translated some of the functions of Oculus games into the OpenVR language, which is compatible with HTC's Vive and other headsets. In December 2015, the company's founder Palmer Luckey said he did not mind if gamers did this. ""If customers buy a game from us, I don't care if they mod it to run on whatever they want,"" he wrote on online community Reddit. He added that his goal was ""not to profit by locking people to only our hardware"". The update to the Oculus operating system, released on Friday, introduced a new ""platform integrity check"" that let software identify whether an Oculus-approved headset was being used. Bypassing the DRM The developer of Libre VR responded with a new patch that bypassed DRM checks in some games completely. But that not only prevented software from checking whether it was being run on an Oculus headset, but also whether it had been legally purchased. ""This is my first success at bypassing the DRM, I really didn't want to go down that path,"" said the developer. He told online technology magazine Motherboard: ""By disabling the ownership check the game can no longer determine whether you legitimately own the game. ""I still do not support piracy - do not use this library for pirated copies."" Oculus has previously said people should not expect hacked games to work ""indefinitely"". ""Regular software updates to games, apps and our platform are likely to break hacked software,"" the company told technology news website Ars Technica in April. Many gaming companies including Sony and Microsoft protect their software with some form of DRM, but Ernesto told the BBC it was not a surprise the Oculus update had been cracked so quickly. ""Oculus should focus on providing a superior platform and the best games instead of focusing on piracy at this point,"" he said. ""It's impossible to defeat piracy completely, but lessons from the movie and music industry show that providing great legal options work better than anti-piracy measures.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour/Tory deal at Stirling Council ousts SNP,"Both parties said their priority would be balancing the local authority's books over the next two years. The deal comes despite the SNP returning nine councillors at last week's local election compared with Labour's eight and the Tories' four. The Nationalists ran Stirling Council as a minority administration between 2008 and May 2012. The SNP condemned the coalition deal, calling it a ""betrayal"" for the people of Stirling. Graham Houston of the SNP, who until the election was council leader, said he was ""amazed"" at the news. He said: ""The people of Stirling will be shocked that the Tories and Labour will get together to form an administration on Stirling Council, despite neither party being the biggest party after Thursday's election."" Mr Houston accused Labour members of desiring power ""at all costs"", adding: ""The dead hand of Labour will grip the levers of power in Stirling once again. ""The real losers will be the people of the Stirling Council area, who after rejecting Labour at the ballot box will nonetheless see Labour entrenched at the helm of Stirling Council. ""The people of Stirling will rightly feel betrayed by this treacherous Labour/Tory alliance."" However, the leader of the authority's Labour group, Corrie McChord said: ""After discussions with the other two parties involved with the council, Labour considers working with the Conservative group in the interests of delivering it's manifesto for the people of Stirling, the best way forward. ""There is an enormous challenge to come in the next two years in terms of balancing our budgets and developing the local economy, but with hard work and determination we can provide more efficient services."" Alistair Berrill, the leader of the local Conservative group added: ""This power sharing deal allows us to work on our key election priorities of focus on the frontline, balancing the council's books and making our school system better. ""There will be disagreements along the way, but we are confident that a good working relationship can be built between the two parties and we can truly achieve for the people of Stirling."" The new administration said it would begin the process of revising the council's objectives and choosing a new governance structure between now and August, with the key posts being appointed at a meeting on 17 May.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Minnie Lisa' unveiled at Beano exhibition in Dundee,"The portrait has been made to celebrate Bash Street's Back at the McManus Galleries, renamed McMenace, becoming the most popular comic exhibition ever in the UK. The gallery is a tribute to the Beano's 80th anniversary and has seen more than 80,000 visitors. Minnie Lisa by ""Duh Vinci"" will be in the exhibition for its final weeks. The portrait shows Minnie with a mysterious enigmatic grin, wearing a trademark red and black jumper. Visitors are being encouraged to share a selfie with 'Minnie Lisa' for the chance to be immortalised as a Beano character. With the addition of the portrait, it is hoped visitor numbers will reach 100,000 by the end of the exhibition, on 21 October. Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: ""I was optimistic we'd get a decent crowd in, probably a better crowd than United and Dundee this season, but what has actually happened has been incredible. So far that it's the most successful exhibition ever in McManus, the most successful exhibition ever Dundee and the most successful comics exhibition in the UK ever. ""We have already whizzed past the 80,000 visitor mark, now before 21 October we are dreaming of making the ton. ""To do that, not only have we uncovered this wonderful piece of art but we are further incentivising things by saying that, if you take a selfie alongside the Minnie Lisa and hashtag 'McMenace' on your social media, one of the people is going to be immortalised as a Beano character."" The current visitor figures beat the previous highest total for a comic exhibition in the UK, 54,324 for Comics Unmasked at the British Library in 2014. Visitor numbers also exceeded other exhibitions held at the McManus such as Ten Drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and Titian's Diana. Carly Cooper, curator of social history at McManus said: ""We hope the people who have come in to see the museum will come in again to see this new piece that has been unveiled. ""We have been absolutely amazed with the exhibition, it has been fantastic, it has been the biggest visitor figures in a while, probably more than we expected, it has been our summer blockbuster.

John Hartson at Maggie's Swansea cancer centre opening,"The retired Arsenal and Celtic striker, who has himself recovered from cancer, was guest of honour as the Â£3m building was officially opened on Friday. It has been built after fundraising by cancer charity Maggie's with Â£1.5m from the Welsh government. Hartson also thanked Wales manager Gary Speed's widow Louise for calling on football fans to support his charity. On the day of Speed's funeral in his home area of Hawarden, Flintshire, Hartson said he was supporting the centre through his foundation as it would help thousands of patients. He said: ""I am incredibly touched by Louise's calls for people to back my charity. Gary was always very supportive of the foundation. ""He even played in a charity match to raise money for it on his own birthday as well as running the London marathon in aid of it. That's the kind of man he was. ""It means an awful lot, especially as some of the money from my foundation will go towards the Maggie's centre, which is a cause very close to my heart. ""I spoke with Gary's father Roger last night to say I could not make it to the funeral because I was opening the centre here today - but my thoughts are with him and his family and I will be attending the memorial service in February."" The centre, which gives care and support to cancer patients and their families, was opened by First Minister Carwyn Jones, Hartson, Japanese ambassador Keiichi Hayashi and the family of the late architect Kisho Kurokawa. Maggie's has run an interim service in the city since 2006, and it is is one of 15 centres the charity has either up and running or planned. 'Lasting legacy' The centre will offer support to people from across south west and mid Wales. Maggie's chief executive Laura Lee said it had only been made possible thanks to the fundraising efforts of people in the region. ""The local community should be proud of the lasting legacy they have created for the thousands affected by the devastating consequences of cancer,"" she added. Hartson, a Wales international who underwent emergency surgery in 2009 after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and his brain, said: ""I know from my own personal experience what a devastating effect cancer can have on you, your family and friends. ""Staff at Maggie's interim centre at Singleton Hospital in Swansea helped me to find a way to live through and beyond cancer. ""I'm really delighted that we are now in a position to open this incredible new Maggie's centre which will help thousands of people in Wales who have been affected by this terrible disease.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"I'm a Celebrity: Kezia Dugdale paid Â£70,000 for appearance","The former Scottish Labour leader also declared between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 worth of travel, accommodation and living expenses, which were paid by ITV. She has donated Â£5,100 of her appearance fee, as well as Â£2,500 of her MSP salary, to charity. Ms Dugdale was formally reprimanded by Labour last month for her absence. She has now published details in the Scottish Parliament's register of interests. The entry includes estimates of the travel and accommodation Ms Dugdale received, as well as a daily payment of 150 Australian dollars which she was given for living expenses while not in the camp. This brought the total sum published in the entry to between Â£80,000 and Â£85,000, including her Â£70,000 fee. A spokesman for Ms Dugdale said she had donated a total of Â£5,100 from her fee to the charities Who Cares? Scotland, Glasgow Women's Aid, and the Archie Foundation. Prior to appearing on the show, she also donated Â£2,500 of her MSP salary to the Rock Trust, an Edinburgh-based charity which supports young people at risk of homelessness. The spokesman added: ""Ms Dugdale received a fee from ITV for appearing on the TV show of Â£70,000. ""Income Tax has been paid both in the UK and in Australia due to the nature of the earnings, which was received in instalments. After tax, this sum is around Â£45,000."" 'Drop in the ocean' Ms Dugdale said she was pleased that a number of charities who do ""amazing work across Scotland"" would benefit for her stint in the jungle. She added: ""I'm delighted to be back in the parliament serving my constituents across the Lothians."" The Scottish Conservatives said Ms Dugdale's charity donations were a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the fee she received, and described her appearance on the show as a ""shameful episode"". Her time in the Australian jungle saw Ms Dugdale crawl through a tank full of fish guts that had ""Sickola Sturgeon"" written on the side. The politician was introduced as one of two late-entry campmates on the ITV reality show in November, before becoming the second person evicted after lasting 11 days in the jungle. News that she had agreed to become a contestant broke just hours before Scottish Labour was due to unveil her successor as leader. It subsequently emerged that she had not asked the party for permission to take part. Ms Dugdale said she wanted to use her time in the jungle to promote ""Labour values"", but was heavily criticised by several colleagues. There had been speculation that Ms Dugdale faced a possible suspension from Labour when she returned to Scotland in December. But she was instead given a formal reprimand following a meeting with new Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, and was told she would face no further disciplinary action.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Meghan and Harry attend NZ ceremony to mark first votes for women,"Meghan was speaking on day one of her visit to the country with Prince Harry. It is the last stop on their tour. The duchess started with a few words of Maori, leading to applause and cheers from the audience in Wellington. She was speaking at an event to mark the 125th anniversary of universal female suffrage in New Zealand. It was the first country in the world where all adult women were allowed to vote. Meghan, wearing a necklace featuring a traditional Maori design for the evening reception, addressed an audience including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern with the Maori greeting: ""Tena koutou katoa."" There were whoops, cheers and friendly laughter at the words. She said: ""The achievements of the women of New Zealand who campaigned for their right to vote and were the first in the world to achieve it are universally admired. ""In looking forward to this very special occasion, I reflected on the importance of this achievement, but also the larger impact of what this symbolises. ""Because yes, women's suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness."" She continued: ""Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents: the basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community."" 'Bravo New Zealand' Meghan ended by saying: ""So bravo New Zealand, for championing this right 125 years ago for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and an acknowledged vote."" ""In the words of your suffragette, Kate Sheppard: all that separates, whether race, class, creed or sex is inhuman and must be overcome."" She was referring to the Liverpool-born leader of the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand, who had emigrated to the country in 1868. Meghan and Harry had been welcomed to the country with a traditional hongi - where they touched noses and foreheads with Maori elders. There was also a powhiri - a ceremony involving singing and dancing - at Government House in Wellington. Members of the New Zealand Defence Force performed a haka for the couple. They then laid a wreath and ferns at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, and saw the UK War Memorial with its intertwined trunks of the Royal Oak and Pohutakawa trees. Harry and Meghan's arrival in Wellington comes after they attended the closing ceremony of the 2018 Invictus Games in Sydney. They have four days in New Zealand. The New Zealand leg of their trip will also include visits to Auckland and Rotorua, before they leave on Thursday to return to the UK.

Thai Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn leads bike ride 'for Mom',"Wearing shirts in the queen's colour - sky-blue - and emblazoned with ""Bike for Mom"", the cyclists paraded through streets closed to traffic. Many Thais outside the capital were expected to do the same. The queen - who turned 83 four days ago - is in very frail health, like the king, and will not be seen. Commentators say the 43km (27-mile) cycle is the first event to be publicly led by the prince, who is 63. About 300,000 people registered to join the ride. The crown prince was followed by other well-known figures including Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his cabinet. With sweltering heat and unforgiving traffic Bangkok is an unpromising setting for a cycling event, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. But against the odds, cycling has taken off as a hobby in recent years, and on Sunday the heir to the throne tapped into that craze. The prime minister said he hoped it would unite a country which is still divided over last year's military coup. Analysis: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Bangkok Thai officials often quietly remind journalists that Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the undisputed heir to the throne, citing the 1924 palace succession law and his investiture in 1972. The harsh lese majeste law prevents any open discussion of the succession, but that has not stopped clandestine gossip in Thailand about ""alternative scenarios"", usually involving the crown prince's popular sister Princess Sirindhorn. This rare appearance at such a high-profile, public event by the Crown Prince - heavily promoted by the military government - will send out a clear signal that he has the backing of the armed forces, and that he can be a ""man of the people"", like his father. It also shows him as a loving and dutiful son. With King Bhumibol in increasingly frail health after 69 years on the throne, the military is pre-occupied with managing an orderly succession; indeed that may have been uppermost in the generals' minds when they launched last year's coup. On Sunday, Thais saw the heir to the throne, usually a remote figure, leading tens of thousands of eager cyclists in Bangkok, all paying tribute to his mother. Few will miss the symbolic importance of such an event. But it is the rare appearance at such a high-profile public event by the 63-year-old crown prince which will be noted by royal-watchers, our correspondent says. Many Thais are anxious about what happens after the death of 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, whose health is very frail. He is widely revered, but observers say the heir apparent does not command similar affection. This event is a chance to improve his public image and promote national unity. Organisers of the cycle ride are also attempting to set a new world record for the greatest number of people cycling at once. The record is currently held by Taiwan, with 72,919.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rajar figures: Radio news listeners fall but boost for music shows,"Today's audience dropped by 839,000 year-on-year, while 5 Live Breakfast was down 337,000, according to Rajar, which monitors UK radio listening. The BBC said a quieter news agenda in the second quarter of this year was partly to blame. Last spring saw a snap general election, the Grenfell Tower fire and three terrorist attacks in the UK. The BBC said: ""There were record figures (7.82 million) last year as the nation turned to Today during significant news events. ""Audience figures fluctuate for news programmes across TV and radio in line with news events and the latest Today figures show a sustained loyal listenership and an overall increase since 2014."" While news and speech programmes may have recorded a loss, many music and entertainment shows went up. Compared with spring 2017, Absolute's breakfast show - presented until recently by Christian O'Connell - added 306,000 listeners, while Kiss Breakfast with Rickie, Melvin and Charlie went up by 42,000. Capital saw listener figures fall compared to last year, with Roman Kemp's breakfast show losing 53,000 listeners, but the show was up on the quarter and held its title as the most listened to breakfast radio show in London. Away from breakfast, LBC attracted 2.1 million listeners across the UK, an increase of 62,000 listeners on the same period last year. Capital Xtra, the urban music station which rebranded from Choice FM in 2013, recorded its highest ever audience of 1.8 million. Other specialist music stations to record an annual increase included Radio X, which went up to 1.7 million weekly listeners. BBC specialist stations also recorded healthy figures, including R&B and hip hop station BBC Radio 1Xtra, which reached 1.03 million listeners - up on both the year and the quarter. The BBC's Asian Network recorded 672,000 listeners - also up on both the year and the quarter - while BBC 6Music reached 2.4 million - a drop on the previous quarter but an increase year-on-year.

Culture secretary questions Edinburgh tourist tax plans,"The council says adding a Â£1 charge to hotel guests' bills could raise Â£11m to fund local services in Edinburgh. Leader Adam McVey posted on Twitter that such a scheme could be ""ready for implementation"" within 12 months. But Fiona Hyslop replied saying there is ""no agreement with the Scottish government"" to make this happen. The council is keen to introduce a ""transient visitor levy"" amid rising visitor numbers. Such occupancy or ""bed tax"" schemes are common in many EU countries, and other UK cities including Hull and London have pondered the idea. However, such a move has been opposed by business groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses, who call it ""potentially damaging"". Ms Hyslop - who was reappointed as culture secretary in June's cabinet reshuffle - has previously stated that taxing tourists ""doesn't make sense"" in light of already high VAT charges on the industry. Mr McVey, an SNP councillor who leads the Edinburgh administration in coalition with Labour, said ""quite a lot of progress"" had been made on the scheme. After he posted on Twitter that plans for a tourist tax would be ""ready for implementation"" within 12 months, fellow SNP representative Ms Hyslop - who is currently in Japan on government business - replied by posting three question marks. She wrote: ""So let's be clear - you have no shared plans, no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish government."" Mr McVey replied that the council was ""in the process of business engagement"" and said there was no agreement with the government ""yet"". He later added: ""All 32 local authority leaders now stand with Edinburgh and other councils looking to pursue a tourist tax and momentum is building.

This is a key part of our programme for the capital and I'm confident we will deliver a transient visitor levy in the best interests of our tourist economy and the people of Edinburgh.""

Covid in Scotland: First screening site opens at Edinburgh airport,"Passengers and staff at the airport, as well as members of the public, will be able to pay for PCR swab tests before receiving their results the next day. Airport managers said the move could help the aviation industry ""drive Scotland's recovery"". But they urged people to continue to follow their local coronavirus restrictions. The tests are being carried out at the ExpressTest site in the FastPark car park area, in front of the terminal. Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: ""Protecting and mitigating risk to public health and providing reassurance and confidence to people who need and want to travel is incredibly important if aviation and all of the industries that rely on it are to recover. ""We have acted with ExpressTest to ensure we are in as strong a position as possible to allow aviation as a facilitator industry to drive Scotland's recovery. ""Until then, people must continue to adhere to local regulations and ensure they understand and follow government guidance to protect themselves and others."" Test results will typically be emailed or sent by text the next day, with airline passengers advised to schedule a test between two and five days before their departure as a precaution. Accuracy 'concerns' Anyone receiving a negative result will be emailed a Fit to Fly certificate authorised by a doctor. But passengers are advised before booking a test at the airport to check if their travel provider will accept the document. ExpressTest founder Nick Markham described the development as ""hugely exciting"". He added: ""The ambition is for us to have 30 locations up and running across the UK in the next few months, and this landmark facility in Edinburgh is just the start."" Passengers and staff at the airport will be charged a subsidised rate of Â£80 and Â£60 respectively to use the service, which will also be available to the general public for Â£99. When asked about airport testing during her daily media briefing the first minister said the Scottish government was working with the airports in a bid to get to a position where testing is, if not a complete alternative to quarantine, then a ""partial alternative"". Nicola Sturgeon said the UK government has already announced its plans to introduce a different system from 15 December but she is continuing to seek clarity on how it would work. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We have some concerns about the accuracy and the reliability of private testing, that's not to say we rule that out, but we are continuing to take a very careful way through coming to a considered decision here. ""I know how important this is for the airports, but it's also important that we get these decisions right so that we're not increasing the risk that travel is posing to our efforts to control the virus.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Depression: 'Mindfulness-based therapy shows promise',"By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News Scientists tested it against anti-depressant pills for people at risk of relapse and found it worked just as well. The therapy trains people to focus their minds and understand that negative thoughts may come and go. In England and Wales doctors are already encouraged to offer it. Patients who have had recurrent clinical depression are often prescribed long-term anti-depressant drugs to help prevent further episodes. And experts stress that drug therapy is still essential for many. In this study, UK scientists enrolled 212 people who were at risk of further depression on a course of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) while carefully reducing their medication. Patients took part in group sessions where they learned guided meditation and mindfulness skills. The therapy aimed to help people focus on the present, recognise any early warning signs of depression and respond to them in ways that did not trigger further reoccurrences. Researchers compared these results to 212 people who continued to take a full course of medication over two years. By the end of the study, a similar proportion of people had relapsed in both groups. And many in the MBCT group had been tapered off their medication. Scientists say these findings suggest MBCT could provide a much-needed alternative for people who cannot or do not wish to take long-term drugs. In their report, they conclude it ""may be a new choice for millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions."" Nigel Reed, who took part in the study, added: ""Mindfulness gives me a set of skills which I use to keep well in the long term. ""Rather than relying on the continuing use of anti-depressants, mindfulness puts me in charge, allowing me to take control of my own future, to spot when I am at risk and to make the changes I need to stay well."" 'Important findings' Providing an independent comment on the study, Dr Gwen Adshead, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""These findings are important from the point of view of people living with depression who are trying to engage in their own recovery. ""And it provides evidence that MBCT is an intervention that primary care physicians should take seriously as an option."" But he cautioned the research does not suggest MBCT is useful for all types of depression; nor that it should replace anti-depressant treatment for people with severe disorders who have needed hospital treatment or are suicidal. And experts caution patients should only reduce their anti-depressant medication under medical supervision. Prof Eduard Vieta, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Barcelona, Spain, said there needed to be more studies to establish how effective MBCT might be. Researchers say their next step is to tease out what the active ingredient in mindfulness therapy might be, and to check it compares favourably to other group-based approaches.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Germany trial: 'Far-right' gunman denies police murder,"Wolfgang P, 49, is accused of murdering the officer when he shot through his front door during an early-morning police raid last October. The officer later died of his wounds and three more were injured. The accused also denies being affiliated with the ReichsbÃ¼rger association of far-right nationalists. His trial, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg, is set to last for 12 days. 'Amateurish' raid It will examine a police raid on the defendant's residence in the small town of GeorgensgmÃ¼nd on 19 October. The police were trying to seize his arsenal of 31 weapons after his permits were revoked on the grounds that he had refused to allow authorities to carry out an inspection and had been deemed ""psychologically unsound"" in an assessment. A police investigation established that as officers tried to enter the property, he shot 11 rounds through the front door, hitting one in the lung and one in the forearm. The trial will now have to establish whether or not, as prosecutors argue, the defendant had learned that a raid was being planned and had prepared for it by donning a bulletproof vest. On Tuesday, his lawyer insisted her client had been asleep when the ""amateurish"" raid began and had no idea that it was a police operation. ""This can't possibly be considered an act of murder,"" Susanne Koller told the court, according to Reuters news agency. Wolfgang P also denies charges of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. He insists he does not belong to the ReichsbÃ¼rger group which rejects the legitimacy of institutions such as the police - believing in the continued existence of the pre-war German Reich. Since the killing, the German intelligence agency has taken a closer interest in the group, and now estimates that about 12,600 people identify as members, including several hundred known far-right extremists. ReichsbÃ¼rger movement The ReichsbÃ¼rger (""Reich Citizens"") group does not recognise the authority of the post-war German federal republic, seeing it merely as some sort of private company. It believes in the continued existence of a German empire, or Reich, dating back to 1937 or even earlier. Its roots are said to go back some three decades. Bavarian officials said the group's ideology was ""nationalist and anti-Semitic.... clearly extreme right"". Their circle had grown in recently years, they said, and included ""whingers, nutcases, conspiracy theorists, but also the far-right"". The diversity of beliefs and views within the group militates against a simple hierarchical structure or clear leadership. But German officials have warned that the group should not be dismissed simply as an ""association of crackpots"". Some 700 members are known far-right extremists, while others are in the police, security services believe. Others use their rejection of the authority of the German state as grounds to refuse to pay taxes or creditors.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hong Kong 'Umbrella' protesters sentenced to jail terms,"Four others received suspended sentences on Wednesday, while one had their sentencing deferred until June. The nine activists were found guilty earlier this month over their involvement in the ""Umbrella Movement"". Demonstrators paralysed Hong Kong in 2014 when they demanded the right for the territory to pick its leaders. Judge Johnny Chan handed down the sentences at the West Kowloon Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning, citing the ""excessive inconvenience and suffering"" the movement caused. Sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, and law professor Benny Tai, 54, who helped set up the Occupy Central group both received 16-month prison sentences. Retired 75-year-old Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming - the third member of the so-called ""Occupy trio"" - also received a 16-month sentence, but it was suspended for two years. The three are seen as the founders of the movement that galvanised protesters in their campaign of civil disobedience. Of the remaining six convicted earlier this month, Raphael Wong and Shiu Ka-chun received eight month prison terms, Eason Chun and Lee Wing-tat received eight-month suspended sentences, and Tommy Cheung was given 200 hours of community service. Tanya Chan had her sentencing delayed until June and her bail extended so she can undergo brain surgery. What were the protests about? The protests started in reaction to a decision made by China that it would allow direct elections in 2017, but only from a list of candidates pre-approved by Beijing. Beijing is highly sensitive about Hong Kong's status and any calls for more autonomy from China. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. In 2014, the three activists' calls for non-violent civil disobedience joined with student-led protests and snowballed into the massive demonstrations. Tens of thousands of people camped in the streets and demanded the right to fully free leadership elections. The protests became known as the Umbrella Movement after people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police to disperse the crowd. Protesters accused the Chinese government of breaking its promise to allow full democracy in Hong Kong, and of encroaching more and more on the region. But the number of protesters dwindled to just a few hundred as the weeks dragged on and they ultimately failed to achieve their goal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nearly 100 subsidised bus routes cut in Wales in 2011-14,"The figures obtained by BBC Wales reveal that nearly one in seven routes across 19 council areas have been axed. The charity Age Cymru warned of the impact this could have on older people saying they could become increasingly isolated and cut off from services. The Welsh government said it was reviewing ways of funding services. But a spokesperson also added that decisions on support for local service remained with councils. Responses to a Freedom of Information request show 93 services have been cut from 656 subsidised routes between 2011 and 2014. Some councils warned they were continuing to review bus services following cuts to transport budgets after a 25% reduction in Welsh government funding. Nineteen out of Wales' 22 councils responded to the BBC Wales questions on bus routes: Mavis Jones, a regular bus user in Brymbo, is near a bus route which is at risk in Wrexham. She said: ""I'd be stuck in the house and I wouldn't be able to go out at all because we haven't got a car and we don't drive, so the buses are very important. ""It would affect the elderly dreadfully. They wouldn't be able to go out to contact anybody, to have a chat or go anywhere at all to meet anyone. They'd be like prisoners in their own home."" In a statement, Wrexham council said: ""At this time, no services have yet been identified as being cut or withdrawn. ""The budget will be discussed by full council on 26 February and we are awaiting to see what funding, if any, will come from the Welsh government after April."" Rob Lewis, deputy leader of Pembrokeshire council, told BBC Radio Wales it was becoming more challenging for councils to provide the same level of service when faced with tough budget decisions. He said the local authority had received more than 700 responses from bus users, which it would use to design a revised service. ""What we are trying to do is provide a service, although it may not be the perfect service we would like to see, but to ensure that people do at least have an opportunity... for them to move around the county albeit on a limited basis,"" he said. The latest figures on service cuts follow a report by the charity Age Cymru last December. In it, the charity claimed there was a lack of bus services in many communities. Spokesman Iwan Rhys Roberts said: ""Older people will become increasingly isolated and cut off from services. They will not be able to access the services that they need. It's a big concern for us."" Responding to the bus service cuts, a Welsh government spokesman told BBC Wales that the transport minister was looking for ""innovative solutions"" to deliver an efficient, sustainable bus service across Wales. ""But local authorities are responsible for determining how they spend the funding we provide and identify which services should be supported and at what level,"" added the government spokesperson.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cancer awareness 'low in black and South Asian groups',"By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News The study of nearly 50,000 people found those with a black ethnic background were least likely to recognise a persistent cough as a possible symptom. And South Asians reported more than others that embarrassment could stop them seeking medical help. The research was presented at England's largest cancer conference. People across England were asked a series of face-to-face or telephone questions about the signs and symptoms of cancer and how likely they were to speak to doctors if they had concerns. Questions included: A team of researchers from eight English universities found black, South Asian and people who identified themselves as 'other ethnic group' were less likely to recognise all cancer symptoms included in the questionnaire than white respondents. While 93% of white participants said a change in the appearance of a mole could indicate the presence of cancer, just 72% of black people and 70% of South Asians recognised this as a potential sign. And black and South Asian groups were four times less likely to recognise an unexpected lump or swelling as a possible warning of cancer. In terms of barriers to seeking help, a quarter of white people said they would be worried about wasting a doctor's time, compared to 19% of South Asians and 16% in the black ethnic group. Sara Hiom at Cancer Research UK said: ""Thousands of people beat cancer every year and treatment is more likely to be successful when cancer is diagnosed in the earliest stages. ""Getting to know your body and what's normal for you will help you spot anything unusual or persistent."" Right message Lead researcher, Maja Niksic, said: ""Evidence suggests people of minority ethnic backgrounds have poorer survival rates for certain cancers and they are more likely to present when the tumour is advanced. ""We need to find ways to present the right health messages to target different needs and different gaps in awareness to give people the same chance of beating cancer regardless of ethnic background."" The authors say previous studies suggested poverty and employment levels could contribute to lower awareness among certain groups. But when they took socioeconomic status, age, education, employment and gender into account, the results did not change. Participants were asked to choose from the following categories: black (included black African, black Caribbean, black other), white (white British, white Irish and any other white), South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and other South Asian) and other (Chinese and mixed ethnicities). The research was presented at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Cancer Conference.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Durham neo-Nazi teenager detained for terror attack plan,"The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparation of terrorist acts between October 2017 and March 2018. He was sentenced to six years and eight months at Manchester Crown Court. Judge David Stockdale QC told the boy: ""These are offences of the utmost seriousness."" He also ordered the detention be followed by an extension period on licence of five years. The six-week trial heard he was an adherent of ""occult neo-Nazism"", and described himself as a ""natural sadist"". His attack preparations included researching explosives and trying to obtain the dangerous chemical ammonium nitrate. He also wrote of planning to carry out an arson spree targeting synagogues in the Durham area using Molotov cocktails. Addressing the defendant, the judge described him as a widely-read ""young man of high intellect"", adding this made it a matter of ""infinite regret"" that he had persisted on ""such a twisted and - many would say sick - ideological path"". He said the evidence in the trial ""tells its own macabre story"", and while his young age was a powerful mitigating factor, it was also a ""most disturbing"" aspect of the case. ""You suffer from an autistic spectrum disorder"", he told him, saying it was common ground between experts. The judge also said the teenager had written him a letter expressing ""remorse"". As well as being found guilty of preparation of terrorist acts, he was also convicted of disseminating a terrorist publication, possessing an article for a purpose connected with terrorism and three counts of possessing a document or record containing information likely to be useful to a terrorist. His trial heard he had visited websites on firearms and was in communication with a gun auctioneer. After his arrest in March 2019, police found him in possession of instructions showing to make bombs and ricin - and that he had distributed firearms manuals online by uploading them to a neo-Nazi website. Earlier in the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Michelle Nelson QC described it as ""a gamut of offending across the terrorism legislation"". Mitigating, Nigel Evans QC said the teenager's lack of contrition may be ""interpreted as part of his autism, his ADHD"", and his parents, who previously ""didn't believe anything was wrong"", were ""now fully engaged"". Speaking after sentencing, Det Ch Supt Martin Snowden from Durham Police said: ""It is never an easy decision to investigate, to arrest and prosecute children of this age. ""We only do this when we think it is the last resort for us to go down that line. ""Prevention is always better than prosecution - we would have always preferred to engage earlier and divert him away from these beliefs and this activity.""

Safoora Zargar: Bail for pregnant India student blamed for Delhi riots,"She was more than three months pregnant when she was arrested in April. Police called her a ""key conspirator"" in anti-Muslim riots that swept Delhi in February, in which 53 people died. Ms Zargar's family denied the allegations, saying that she had only been a part of protests against a controversial citizenship law. However, Ms Zargar was charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) - a draconian law that makes it nearly impossible for the accused to get bail. Her incarceration in the overcrowded Tihar jail had caused a lot of concern, especially at a time when India was under a strict lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Delhi High Court granted her bail in response to a plea filed by a fellow student who said that Ms Zargar was suffering from medical complications. The government, which had opposed all her bail pleas so far, said it would not oppose it this time on ""humanitarian grounds"". The court has asked her not to leave the city and also told her not to engage in ""any activity which would hamper the progress of the investigation"" in her case. She has been asked to pay a personal bond of 10,000 rupees ($132; Â£106) before her release. Her husband - who has declined to be named - told the BBC that they expected her to be released today. Ms Zargar is among a number of Muslim students and activists who have been jailed since India's lockdown began on 25 March, leading to accusations that the government is using the pandemic to crack down on free speech and dissent. As a member of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a student group at her university, she had been active in organising peaceful protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in north-east Delhi. Critics of the law have said that it discriminates against Muslims. Ms Zargar, now six months pregnant, soon emerged as the face of state repression against students and activists. ""The government of India has been exceedingly intolerant towards free speech and dissent,"" Amnesty International India Executive Director Avinash Kumar said in a statement at the time of her arrest. ""But to arrest Safoora who is in the second trimester of her pregnancy and send her to an overcrowded prison during the pandemic highlights how brutal is the ongoing clampdown in the country."" This led her to be attacked by government supporters on social media, who attempted to slut-shame her, posting vulgar comments suggesting she was unmarried and raising questions over her pregnancy.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stanford rape case Judge Aaron Persky faces recall petition,"Community leaders from Santa Clara County filed a notice of intention on Monday to collect signatures to recall Judge Aaron Persky next year. Judge Persky was accused of leniency in his June 2016 punishment of Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. Turner had faced up to 14 years, but was handed a six-month sentence. He was released after serving only three months in county jail for the January 2015 assault. ""Judge Aaron Persky stunned the world when he sentenced Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at a fraternity party,"" the notice to circulate a recall petition states. Stanford law professor Michele Dauber, who is leading the recall effort along with 50 community leaders, said at a news conference: ""Santa Clara County residents deserve a judge who will protect victims, not rapists. ""Women have had enough of rape culture,"" she added. ""We are ready to take action and recall this judge."" Judge Persky has seven days to submit a written response of no more than 200 words, said Anita Torres, a spokesperson for the county's registrar of voters. His response, which would appear in next year's guide document for voters, would be expected to set out the case for why he should remain on the bench, Ms Torres added. If activists can gather 58,634 signatures - 20% of the voting electorate - in the next 160 days, then voters in the 2018 countywide elections would vote on the recall. On a website created by Judge Persky, he argues he has ""a reputation for being fair to both sides"". ""I believe strongly in judicial independence,"" he writes. ""I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues."" After Judge Persky's controversial ruling, the California State Assembly passed a law expanding the definition of rape and increased penalties for offenders who assault unconscious victims. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen also successfully had another sexual assault case removed from Judge Persky's docket, and he has already been transferred to a civil court in San Jose. Judge Persky has been cleared of misconduct by the California Commission on Judicial Performance.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Muslim families sending children to Catholic schools,"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent For the first time an annual census of Catholic schools has collected information on the number of pupils from other religions. The biggest group of non-Catholic pupils are from other Christian denominations - but almost a tenth are from Muslim families. The government has plans to encourage more Catholic free schools to open. This analysis shows that, overall, nearly a third of the more than 850,000 pupils within the Catholic school system are not Catholic - a total of almost 290,000. Changing populations This can reflect local demographic changes and migration - with Catholic schools serving areas with a declining number of Catholic families. The Muslim pupils are the biggest non-Christian group, apart from the 63,000 who are from non-religious families. Finnuala Nelis, head of St Patrick's Catholic Voluntary Academy in Sheffield, is in charge of a school where about half the pupils are not Catholics. She says there have been changes in the local population - and that the school is now popular with parents who choose a Catholic school, even though they are not Catholics. This includes Christians from a number of African churches and also Muslim pupils. She says there are Muslim pupils who regularly attend their local mosques, but who will go to Catholic religious services at school. Talking to parents Muslim parents are able to withdraw their children from religious celebrations at the school, says Mrs Nelis, but they want their children to participate. ""It's not an uncomfortable zone"" to talk about these subjects with children or parents, she says. Muslim parents are also able to take their children out of school on Muslim festivals, such as Eid. She says that non-Catholic parents choose the school because of the ethos and ""value system"", as well as Catholic schools' reputation for a ""good standard of education"". The government wants to change the rules for free schools to encourage more Catholic ones to open. At present, free schools run by faith groups can only allocate half of their places on grounds of religion - a limit that the government has announced it will remove. The government argues that Catholic schools combine ethnic diversity with high standards. In Catholic primary schools, 37% of pupils are from ethnic minorities, higher than the national average. But opponents have warned that expanding faith schools will encourage social segregation. The appeal of Catholic schools to Muslim families might also reflect the fact that there are relatively few Muslim schools in state system. Among more than 6,800 faith schools in the state school system, only 28 are Muslim, with two more in the pipeline. Paul Barber, director of the Catholic Education Service, said Catholic schools were ""beacons of diversity and integration up and down the country"". ""Often, parents of different faiths and none value the distinctive and unapologetically Catholic ethos of the Church's schools.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Isa Muazu: Nigeria to accept UK deportee's plane,"Isa Muazu was returned to the UK after a private jet chartered to take him to Nigeria on Friday was turned back. According to officials the relevant documents for the flight had not been completed. Mr Muazu, on hunger strike for more than 100 days, has said he fears being killed by Islamic extremists. A spokesman for Nigeria's aviation ministry told the BBC that permission had now been granted for a privately chartered jet carrying Mr Muazu to land in Nigeria, although he said it was not clear if any flight was imminent. The Home Office has rejected Mr Muazu's arguments and attempted to deport the 45-year-old on Friday after he lost a series of legal challenges. 'Seriously ill' He has been detained since claiming asylum in July, saying he faced persecution from the militant Islamic group Boko Haram. Mr Muazu entered the UK on a visitor's visa in July 2007 and stayed without permission after it expired in January 2008. It is believed he then found work in south-east London and was detained on the day he claimed asylum, 25 July of this year. Duncan Lewis Solicitors, representing Mr Muazu, said his case was then fast-tracked and his application rejected in August. The firm said he had made himself ""seriously ill"" in his protest, adding: ""His hunger strike lasted for over 100 days"". A claim that his detention was unlawful was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 25 November, and two last-minute appeals were also refused, his lawyers said. 'No humanity' Labour believes the government has questions to answer over the case. After the plane was prevented from landing in Nigeria, Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ""Deportations should be carried out with competence and humanity - neither of those things seem to have happened in this case"". Mr Muazu's lawyers say he has returned to the medical wing at Harmondsworth detention centre near Heathrow. The Nigerian is 5ft 11in (1.8m) tall, weighs eight stone (53kg) and has described himself as ""looking like a skeleton"", his lawyers have said. He has said that he came to the UK ""for a better life"" and would ""rather die"" than face removal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Badger cull: Queen's Brian May praises Welsh government for halting plan,"The Queen guitarist and badger campaigner congratulated Environment Minister John Griffiths and said he had made a courageous decision. Mr Griffiths has opted to vaccinate the animals following a review. Farmers said they were not opposed to vaccination, but it was not enough on its own. Mr Griffiths revealed on Tuesday that he was scrapping the plan, saying a five-year vaccination programme will start in the intensive action area - the TB hotspot in north Pembrokeshire where the cull was due to take place. His decision disappointed farming unions and Labour's political opponents, who strongly backed the cull. May joined the campaign against it in March 2010 and told BBC Radio Wales: ""(I would) certainly congratulate John Griffiths who has made a very courageous decision here in the face of extreme pressure from the extreme end of the farmers' unions. ""Of course, there are many farmers who do take the attitude that vaccination is the answer and we strongly feel that John Griffiths has done the right thing for farmers as well as wild animals."" North Pembrokeshire organic dairy farmer Aled Rees, who has been under TB restrictions since 2002, said farmers were not opposed to a vaccination programme, but it was not enough on its own. ""Out here at the coalface, living with this disease daily like we have for 10 years, we know it's not going to be enough,"" he said. ""When we're losing cattle hand over fist every two months there's very little hope. 'Strong leadership' ""Vaccination as part of a wider package would be the answer. He (Mr Griffiths) should be going ahead, showing strong leadership, with a cull in that area and then bringing vaccination once we've taken out the diseased badgers. ""If he did that we would have confidence that this would work."" A review of the cull was commissioned after last year's assembly elections. The cull had been part of an attempt by the former Labour-Plaid Cymru coalition government to combat bovine TB in parts of west Wales. Officials hope to start vaccinating within two to three months. Badgers will be trapped in cages and marked so they are not vaccinated multiple times.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Germany strikes explained: The long and the short of it,"This week's strikes could be the first of many. So why do they matter? And what do they say about Germany in 2018? We've boiled the story down to 100 words and 400 words - you can read them individually or one after the other. Rare all-day strikes by thousands of German metal and engineering workers started on Wednesday and will end on Friday. About 260 companies are affected. Their union, IG Metall, wants an 8% pay rise spread over a few years. But they also want companies to let workers reduce their weekly hours from 35 to 28 on full pay if they need to care for children or elderly or sick relatives, before returning to full-time work after two years. This last point is the big bone of contention - companies are willing to negotiate on pay but not on the reduced hours option. IG Metall is one of the biggest unions in Europe, with 3.9 million members. So when its members decided to go on strike, it was a significant development. Thousands of members of the metals and engineering union have walked out in one-day ""warning strikes"" between Tuesday and Friday. They were the union's first such strikes in 34 years. Among the companies affected are Porsche and Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz cars. The dispute comes down to two main points. Firstly, the union wants a pay rise of 8% for its staff over the next 27 months. Employers have offered a 6.8% increase. Secondly, it also wants: IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann said: ""We need pay to be subsidised, so that children, caring for family and health don't depend on how much you have in your wallet."" But Oliver Zander, of metals industry federation Gesamtmetall, disagrees. ""The basic principle that whoever works less also earns less, must continue to apply,"" he told Die Welt. ""We can not shake it."" There's some important context here: Germany's economy grew by 2.2% last year, its fastest rate in six years. And unemployment hit a new low in January - just 5.4% of people are out of work. After a 10-year period where wages have grown by an average of only 0.81% as the economy has picked up, the unions sense it's their turn to make demands on employers. It's not clear how many people would take up the option of reduced hours if employers agreed to it. One person who would welcome the change is Souad Benchakra, who works at Geberit, which makes toilet bowls and taps. ""I switched from full-time to part-time work because of my children and now I don't have the opportunity to return to full-time,"" she told Reuters. IG Metall's Joerg Hofmann warns that open-ended industrial action is possible if the demands are not met. A wider strike over 10 days could cost industries at least â¬2.5bn (Â£2.2bn, $3.1bn), Cologne-based think tank IW says. Read more explainers like this one",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rag'n'Bone Man: New songs for Record Store Day 2018,"By Jimmy BlakeNewsbeat reporter Now in its 11th year, the event celebrates local, independent record stores. As part of his role Rag'n'Bone Man has recorded two new songs direct to vinyl. Don't Set The World On Fire and George Has Got A Friend will be among the special releases on 21 April. Speaking to Newsbeat before the session he said: ""This is one of the most amazing things I've done so far."" ""These songs don't exist anywhere else. They've never been recorded before. They're not on the last album and they won't be on the next one either."" Record Store Day has ambassadors all over the world. In the past they've included Elton John, Metallica and Iggy Pop. More contemporary acts have been getting involved in the last few years: Slaves, Kate Tempest and Izzy Bizu were among the 2017 UK ambassadors. Rag'n'Bone Man, who is the only UK ambassador this year, says there's been a shift in attitude towards vinyl, from both musicians and fans. ""It's changed a lot in the last 10 years. Now it's basically streaming and vinyl."" While the number of downloads and CD sales has steadily dropped in the last five years, streaming and vinyl have continued to grow in popularity - with 4.1 million records sold in 2017. ""I don't tend to look at my sales but I was given a breakdown of where it's [his music] being sold,"" he added. ""It's amazing how much is vinyl. I'd never release music that wasn't on vinyl. ""You get to the end of making the music, then comes the part when you think: 'How do I want this to look?' ""It's a true representation of who you are as an artist. You put a lot into it. ""There's a certain amount of that [that] is lost with digital music."" Rag'n'Bone Man recorded the new songs, which will only be available on Record Store Day, live at Metropolis Studio in London. ""They're both personal songs. I wrote one of them on tour, and the other one while my partner was pregnant. She was actually in labour at the time. ""That one's called George Has Got A Friend.

Andrew Lloyd Webber: Arts at risk over austerity cuts,"Speaking at the House of Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber said the sector was being put at risk by policies introduced in the wake of the recession. He added Britain's creative industries were being ""strangled"" due to the government's lack of funding strategy. He warned ministers could not rely on benefactors indefinitely and urged them to invest in nurturing British talent. During the debate, on whether the government had a long-term strategy in place, the composer said arts funding was under ""unimaginable strain"". He cited the end of the Film Council and the closure of the University of East Anglia's music department as evidence of the impact of cuts. ""I can't help feel that in this cult of austerity Britain, the government is turning its back on one if its most promising and extraordinary world-leading sectors,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber said. ""There is a simple truth that should lie at the heart of this debate - Britain still leads the world in the creative industries. And if Austerity Britain ignores that fact we will surely live to regret it."" 'Home truths' He added: ""We need to challenge the mind set of government. ""Without the private funding and support of many private individuals and institutions up and down the country the situation that I describe would be so much worse, in fact in many ways it would be irretrievable."" Speaking for the government during the debate, Viscount Younger praised Lord Lloyd-Webber's ""incomparable support"" for arts and culture but said he did not entirely share his views on the current situation. He said the government's overarching strategy was to see a ""thriving and resilient"" arts and cultural sector, drawing from a range of funding sources. However he stressed the need for some ""home truths"" on finance, insisting the government's first priority should be to create financial stability. ""This means, regrettably, the sharing of some pain - in some cases considerable pain - across all sectors of society. It would be unrealistic for cuts to be made in all other parts of the public sector except the arts."" Responding to the debate, a DCMS spokesman told the BBC: ""Over the life of this Parliament, the government is investing Â£2.3bn in the arts. ""We have also reformed the National Lottery, increasing the share to the arts, so the Arts Council's overall budget in 2015 will be reduced by less than 5% in real terms, compared to 2010. ""This is a remarkably good deal and part of our comprehensive strategy to set the arts and cultural sectors up for a healthy and resilient future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Emiliano Sala: No further action after manslaughter arrest,"The Argentine striker, 28, was killed in a plane crash along with pilot David Ibbotson just two days after signing for Cardiff City in January 2019. In June, Dorset Police arrested a 64-year-old man from North Yorkshire. The force said it would ""not be seeking a formal charging decision by the CPS in relation to homicide offences"". Det Insp Simon Huxter said: ""We have carried out a detailed examination into the circumstances of Mr Sala's death, this has been a complex investigation involving the examination of a large amount of evidence and in liaison with a range of organisations. ""An investigation into the operation of the flight continues and this is being led by the CAA and therefore it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment at this time."" He said Sala's family had been updated about the decision. Sala was travelling from Nantes to Cardiff on 21 January 2019 when the single-engine Piper Malibu N264DB aircraft he was travelling in lost contact with air traffic control north of Guernsey. His body was recovered in February 2019 but the body of Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, has not been found. The footballer was signed by Cardiff City for Â£15m, but never played for the club. His death sparked a row between the Bluebirds and his former club Nantes over whether the transfer fee should be paid. Last month, the deadline for Cardiff City to pay its first instalment of the transfer fee was extended until 27 February. Three months after Sala was killed, his father Horacio Sala, who had been critical of his son's treatment, died at the age of 58 after having a heart attack. After the crash, an official search was called off on 24 January 2019 after Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search and his body was recovered 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey on 6 February 2019. Sources subsequently told BBC Wales Mr Ibbotson's pilot licence restricted him to ""flights by day only"". Flight plans indicated the flight had been scheduled to leave Nantes airport at 09:00 local time on 21 January, but was postponed until 19:00 to allow the footballer to spend the day saying goodbye to his Nantes teammates. An interim report, published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said Mr Ibbotson was not licensed to carry paying passengers. In August, the AAIB said toxicology tests showed that prior to the crash, Sala was exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide that were great enough to cause a seizure, unconsciousness or a heart attack. It is likely Mr Ibbotson would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Last month, the UK government said it would look at how ""grey"" charter flights can be prevented following the crash, and the House of Lords heard the use of ""unlicensed air taxis"" was a growing problem in the aviation industry.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vodafone error sees customers hit by thousands in charges,"Customers took to Twitter, saying they were unable to use their phones and could not reach the operator. Many received alerts from Vodafone that their data had run out, despite the fact that many still had data remaining in their monthly allowances. Vodafone said the issue was caused by a technical error. Since 2017, under EU regulations UK consumers are able to use the minutes, texts and data included on their mobile phone tariffs when travelling in the EU at no extra charge. Vodafone customers posted on Twitter that their bills had risen by between hundreds and thousands of pounds within just 12 hours. 'This is a joke' Andy Pearch told the BBC that on Sunday, just 24 hours into his holiday in Malta, he had a shock when he received a text message from Vodafone informing him that he had spent Â£4,902.75 in ""additional charges"". To prevent him from incurring an even larger bill, Vodafone said it was preventing him from making any calls, sending text messages or using mobile data on his phone. But when Mr Pearch logged onto his Vodafone account using the hotel Wi-Fi, it showed that he still had 14.2GB of data remaining out of his 20GB monthly data allowance. ""Stress is not the word for it,"" Mr Pearch said. ""My service was cut off from 22:00 last night till about 08:00 this morning."" Regional sales manager Kevin Navette is currently abroad, but he has been blocked by Vodafone from using his work phone. Mr Navette told the BBC that he has been charged Â£3,000 and his service stopped working on Sunday. However, despite contacting Vodafone on Twitter on Sunday and Monday morning, his service is still not working. ""This is my professional phone so it's big trouble for me,"" he said. Vodafone said: ""We are very sorry that some customers could not use their phones yesterday, when roaming abroad. This was due to a technical error, which we have now fixed. ""Some customers are receiving billing messages in error; we are working through these as an urgent priority and are removing any errors from customer accounts. Customers will not be charged and do not need to worry about contacting us as we are proactively checking accounts."" In August, a similar issue affected Three Ireland. The mobile operator had to apologise after a system upgrade error added bogus roaming fees to customers' bills and suspended their services.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Savile: Knighthood committee 'told about abuse in 1998',"The head of the Honours Committee also resisted pressure from Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s to knight Savile, according to letters seen by the probe. Savile sexually abused at least 72 people, including eight who were raped. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is investigating both institutions and public figures. Savile, who died in 2011, was ultimately knighted in 1990 in recognition of his charity work. The Westminster strand of the inquiry heard civil servants were wary of Savile as early as 1984. In letters exchanged with then prime minister Mrs Thatcher's secretary, committee head Lord Robert Armstrong cited interviews with Savile published in the Sun the previous year in which the BBC DJ boasted about sleeping with hundreds of girls, having people assaulted, and telling a suicidal man how he could take his own life. ""My committee did not feel that sufficient time has elapsed since Mr Savile's unfortunate revelations in the popular press in April of this year,"" Lord Armstrong wrote. ""He is much in the public eye and it is unlikely that the lurid details of his story will have been forgotten. I fear it would be best if Mr Savile were to wait a little longer."" He later refused to include him in the birthday honours list, saying time had ""served only to strengthen the doubts felt about a knighthood for Mr Savile"". He had been advised awarding a knighthood to Savile would bring the honours system into ""disrepute"", he wrote. In 1998, the committee received an anonymous letter that said ""reports of a paedophilia nature"" could emerge about Savile and allegations about his involvement with boys. It said: ""While within limits and bounds homosexuality can be rationalised in a modern society, we must not lose sight that paedophilia goes beyond any boundaries which right-minded people of whatever political persuasions find abhorrent."" Giving evidence to the inquiry, senior civil servant Helen MacNamara - who currently heads the Honours and Appointments Secretariat - said such a letter would now be passed to police immediately. She added that she did not know how the letter was dealt with at the time or if any concerns were raised with authorities. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces, and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. The inquiry is being led by Prof Alexis Jay, a former director of social services who headed the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. The inquiry's public hearings consist of 13 separate investigations, which are expected to last until 2020.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Insurers warn of travel premium rise,"By Simon GompertzPersonal finance correspondent, BBC News Drivers going on holiday could need also need extra paperwork, the Association of British Insurers said. Next Thursday Prime Minister Theresa will try to win agreement on a Brexit transition period. The Department for Exiting the EU said it was ""focused on getting a good outcome"" for the UK and the EU. It's only two weeks until the annual policies insurers sell will need to provide cover beyond Brexit day, the 29 March next year. If there's a transition period, perhaps to the end of 2020, the process is expected to carry on as before. But if there's no agreement next week, insurers say they will have to fear the worst. They could start warning motor policyholders that they will need a Green Card - an international document proving you have insurance - when they drive their cars into the EU after Brexit. And if travellers can't depend on their European Health Insurance Cover (EHIC) cards, which entitle them to medical treatment across the EU, the price of travel insurance will be affected. Hassle on the horizon Huw Evans, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""It's very important that the government reaches agreement next week with our European partners."" ""Travellers and motorists could easily be disrupted if we don't have an agreement for what happens when we leave the EU in March 2019,"" he said. It would mean extra costs and extra hassle. Of course insurers will make sure that motorists and holidaymakers are covered and are protected in the way they need to be. But if you're a motorist it would mean that you may need to show green card documentation at a border crossing. And if you are a holidaymaker it means that you will have a to buy a travel insurance policy that covers you for things that are currently covered by the EHIC card, which will probably cost you more. The government appears optimistic that the situation won't arise. The Department for Exiting the EU said it was increasingly confident about a deal with the EU and that the prospect of leaving without one had reduced significantly. Deal or no deal? A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are focused on getting a good outcome - one that works for the people and businesses of the UK and EU."" After a last-minute deal struck in December, the spokesperson said the government was ""increasingly confident that we will secure a deal with the EU and that the prospect of leaving negotiations with 'no deal' has reduced significantly. ""We want our future relationship with the EU to be a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation. ""We do not want or expect a no deal outcome,"" the spokesperson added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Austria election: 'Grand coalition' can rule again,"There was a surge in support for the Eurosceptic right-wing Freedom Party (FPOe), which got 21.4%. The Social Democrats (SPOe) came top with 27.1% and the conservative People's Party (OeVP) got 23.8% in Sunday's election. The conservative leader warned that the result was a ""wake-up call"". Michael Spindelegger said ""we can't simply go on as before"" - and he did not rule out a coalition with the FPOe. Chancellor Werner Faymann, leader of the SPOe, said he was against any ""experiments"" and called for coalition talks with Mr Spindelegger's OeVP. Swing to right Turnout was 74.4%, which was 4.4% down on the last election in 2008. The anti-immigration and Eurosceptic FPOe, led by Heinz-Christian Strache, added nearly four percentage points to its 2008 result, winning four new seats and bringing its total to 42. Its 21.4% still falls short of the shock 27% the party achieved under Joerg Haider in 1999. The SPOe lost four seats, and the OeVP lost five. They still got 99 seats in total - enough for a majority. They have ruled jointly for much of Austria's post-war history. Austrians, with an electorate of six million, were choosing 183 deputies for the lower house of parliament. A party must cross a 4% hurdle to be represented in the chamber. Mr Faymann appears set to remain at the head of the coalition as chancellor. The governing parties had each claimed credit for keeping unemployment low during years of economic difficulties for the European Union. The Social Democrats also focused on pensions, pledging a tax on ""millionaires"" and cuts for low earners. Meanwhile, the OeVP campaigned for measures to free businesses from red tape, rejecting the proposed wealth tax. Scandals and inertia A series of scandals and perceived inertia have hit the ruling parties' popularity among the voters. The Freedom Party appears to have benefited from this slump. The party has accused the coalition of bloating the public sector, corruption and permitting too much immigration. The Eurosceptic Team Stronach of Austro-Canadian billionaire Frank Stronach gained a foothold in parliament, winning 5.8%. The liberal New Austria party - Neos - is also a newcomer to parliament with 4.8%. The Greens are on 11.5%, a rise of one percentage point. In addition to their traditional environmental themes, they have sought to capitalise on a funding scandal involving the coalition.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cilla Black encouraged me to be an actress - now I'm playing her on stage,"Hayworth followed her instruction. Now 28, she has won her first major role appearing as the star on stage. She will play the late singer and TV host in Cilla The Musical, which will use songs like Anyone Who Had a Heart and Alfie to tell her life story. It will open in Liverpool, Cilla's home city, in September before a UK tour. Hayworth, from Watford, tried out at one of a number of open auditions that were held around the country. She won the role at a final round of auditions at Liverpool's Cavern Club, where Cilla started out. Hayworth said: ""When I was 11 I was shopping with my mum and bumped into Cilla and asked her for an autograph. ""I told her I wanted to be an actress - she laughed and said, 'It's a tough industry, but if you really work hard and go for it, you'll be just fine'. ""She was a huge inspiration to me as a child. I grew up watching her on Blind Date every Saturday night with my nan. To be chosen to play her is such an honour and I'm so excited to take on the role."" Hayworth trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Cilla's son Robert Willis said: ""We wanted somebody who wasn't going to impersonate my mum but someone who could capture her spirit. ""Kara came in with her huge personality and amazing voice - when I saw the response of the audience at the Cavern, I knew she was the one my mum would have wanted!"" The show is being adapted from the 2014 three-part ITV drama that starred Sheridan Smith in the central role. Cilla Black was one of Britain's biggest singing stars of the 1960s before switching to TV and achieving national treasure status as the host of Blind Date and Surprise, Surprise.

Coronavirus: Homebirths to restart with new safeguards,"The arrangement in the Lothians includes a limit of one birthing partner and the need for a separate changing space for midwives. The move follows fears resuming the homebirth service would put midwives at extra risk of catching Covid-19. Homebirths were suspended in most areas at the start of the pandemic. Frances McGuire, chief midwife for NHS Lothian, said: ""We have been working hard to ensure that we can deliver the safest possible home birth service for mums, their newborn babies and our midwives. ""We are confident we now have systems in place and the service will resume on 29 June."" The service had been due to resume in the Lothians on 1 June but stalled until midwives were given guarantees about their safety in other people's houses. The agreement brokered by trade unions means only one partner is allowed through the labour and birth, and if the home has two toilets then one must be for the sole use of the midwife. A separate area for the midwife to get changed into protective clothing, as well as take breaks from the rest of the household, must also be provided. 'Once you go into labour you just go into that zone' Louise and Alfie Day desperately wanted their second child to be born at home and thought that chance had escaped them when the coronavirus lockdown saw the suspension of midwife-supported homebirths. But the couple decided to press ahead anyway and Louise delivered baby Eilidh herself three weeks ago. ""I really wanted my baby at home from the start, before Covid I thought it was the safest place and when Coronavirus struck I just thought I don't want to put my family at risk by going into hospital, so I just decided to go ahead and just try it,"" she said. ""I was quite worried about it, but once you go into labour you just go into that zone. ""Labour's hard but it was made more relaxed by being at home with my husband."" Louise later wrote on Facebook that the birth was ""hands-off and instinctive"" but after it she decided to go to hospital to get checked. She had a third-degree tear and required surgery and an overnight stay.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Unions call for end to local authority pay freeze,"Unison, Unite and the GMB have lodged their annual pay claim, saying a ""living wage"" of Â£7.20 an hour should be brought in. They have also asked for a Â£1,000 flat rate payment for workers, aimed at benefiting those on the lowest incomes. Local authority body Cosla said the issue of pay was settled until 2013. Dougie Black, of Unison, said those who were the lowest paid in Scotland's councils had been hit the hardest as the cost of living rose. He said: ""Families are already struggling to make ends meet and if their pay is frozen for a second year and costs remain high, whole families will be pushed further into poverty."" Mr Black said a promised Â£250 payment by the government to ""soften the blow"" of a pay freeze for the lowest paid had been denied to local government workers. He added: ""While other low-paid public service workers have had this flat rate increase, yet again council workers go without."" 'Bottom line' Jackson Cullinane, from Unite, said: ""The pay claim lodged today is fair and affordable and will make a big difference to low paid workers who have been bearing the brunt of government cuts for too long."" Eleven councils already pay their staff the living wage of Â£7.20 and six councils have now confirmed they will pay it from April this year, while another two have indicated their intention to introduce the measure. However, a spokesman for Cosla said that while the employers organisation was ""appreciative"" that local government workers has acted with ""restraint"" in pursuing pay awards, he said councils were still facing the prospect of delivering services in difficult economic times. He added: ""The bottom line is that pay in local government across all of the workforce is settled until April 2013. ""We acknowledge the financial pressures this has created. The majority of councils have responded by introducing the Living Wage of Â£7.20 an hour benefiting those at the lower end of the pay scales. ""Additionally, about one third of the workforce will have benefited from pay increments as they move up pay scales, where this applies."" The spokesman said that talks with the trade unions were planned to begin this week to examine the prospect of ending the current freeze on pay from April 2013 onwards.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Greece 'may need 10bn euros more' in aid - Stournaras,"Yannis Stournaras said: ""If there is need for further support to Greece, it will be in the order of about 10bn euros (Â£8.6bn; $13.4bn), or much smaller than the previous programmes."" Greece has already received two bailouts totalling about 240bn euros. Meanwhile, Angela Merkel has warned about writing down any more Greek debt. Germany's chancellor said a so-called haircut of Greek debt would be bad for the stability of the eurozone, which has seen a return in investor confidence after years of worrying about the future of the single currency following bailouts of several nations - most recently, Cyprus. ""I am expressly warning against a haircut,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""It could trigger a domino effect of uncertainty with the result that the readiness of private investors to invest in the eurozone again falls to nothing."" Her comments come after Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said - for the first time - earlier this month that Greece will need another bailout to plug a forthcoming funding gap. The issue of bailouts is a sensitive one in Germany, where Mrs Merkel faces elections for a third term on 22 September. Many Germans feel they have already contributed enough to European bailouts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last month estimated Greece would need around 11bn euros in 2014-15. 'No more austerity' On Sunday, Mr Stournaras told Greek newspaper Proto Thema that any further bailout would be smaller than the previous two. But he also warned that Greece would not accept any more forced spending cuts from its partners. ""We are not talking about a new bailout but an economic support package without new [austerity] terms... until 2016, the targets - our obligations - have been set and other measures or targets cannot be required."" The Greek economy has shrunk further than any other in Europe, with bailout money only released on condition that the government imposes cuts and implements restructuring. It comes after most of the 18-member eurozone countries came out of recession earlier this year. Greece's troika of lenders - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - will review the aid programme in the autumn.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Crossing Divides: Do you live in a social bubble?,"We asked people in an international poll how they felt about their choice of friends. See how you compare in our interactive quiz: The results of the survey, conducted among people with internet access across 27 countries, suggested respondents felt their social circles to be much more diverse than is generally recognised by academics. ""The research shows that people like to remain optimistic, they like to feel they are diverse and tolerant,"" says Ipsos Mori's Glenn Gottfried, who oversaw the fieldwork. ""It is a very positive finding, even if... we may not do as much as we think we should to escape the 'social bubble' we live in."" Note on quiz methodology The answers to each survey question are categorised according to where they fit on a spectrum between comparative isolation from people with different backgrounds and points of view to strong connections with them. The result assigned at the end of the quiz is based on an aggregation of the position on the spectrum for each answer given, so people who click the most socially isolated answer for each question will end up in the ""bubbling over"" category, and those clicking the opposite answers will get ""bubble free"", with middling answers steering readers towards the corresponding middling categories. But the categories at the end of the quiz are defined by the responses people gave to the survey, rather than any arbitrary definition of what it means to be in a social bubble. So, if an answer corresponds to one end of the spectrum but was also a common response in the survey, then this will steer the reader towards the relevant category less than if it were an unusual survey response. For example, when asked whether it was ""important to listen to people who are different"" from themselves, many people in the survey sample answered ""very much"" - in fact this was the most common answer. Therefore answering this way in the quiz would mean that a reader would still be heading towards the ""bubble free"" category, but to a lesser extent than the opposite answer (""not at all"") would steer a reader towards the ""bubbling over"" category.

Mayor considers Hoo peninsula in Kent as airport option,"Mr Johnson wants to increase flight capacity around London without expanding Heathrow. He has also been considering building an airport in the Thames Estuary. A spokesperson for the Mayor said it was vital that a location for extra runway capacity was found for London to remain one of the leading world cities. Wintering birds In 2002, a new airport at Cliffe on the Hoo peninsula was one of several options being considered by the government for airport expansion in the South East. However, in December 2003, the government decided to leave Cliffe out of its airport expansion plans. The latest proposal for the Hoo peninsula has been put forward by John Olsen, the British former head of Cathay Pacific. The site is renowned for its populations of wintering birds, while in summer it is an important breeding ground for birds such as avocets, marsh harriers, Mediterranean gulls and little terns. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Johnson's spokesperson said: ""The Mayor has kickstarted a debate about the best way to increase airport capacity in and around London and every extra contribution to that discussion is welcome. ""The Deputy Chairman of Transport for London, Daniel Moylan, is working on a review that will certainly take Mr Olsen's proposal into account. ""But whatever conclusion is eventually reached it is vital that a location for extra runway capacity is found for London to remain one of the leading world cities."" 'Absolute madness' Paul Clark, former Labour MP for Gillingham and Rainham, in north Kent, described the proposal as ""absolute madness"". ""The government back in 2002/2003 went through a big exercise of commissioning numerous reports to look at how we coped with the expansion of air demand in the South East,"" he said. ""One of those proposals was exactly this one that seems to have resurrected itself out on Cliffe. ""The costs involved, let alone environmentally the damage that is done, and the threat that it would give to the safety of passengers through bird strike and so on, makes it a very dangerous plan to proceed with."" Mr Clark urged the government to ""do a U-turn"" and accept that Heathrow ""is really the only practical solution to expanding our hub airport... to accommodate the demands of both business and pleasure aviation requirements in the future"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: People 'have got the message' and stayed home,"The Welsh Government responded by imposing severe curbs on people's lives, with fines for disobeying.

One mountain rescue leader described the flood of people a week ago as like a ""bank holiday on steroids"". Snowdonia National Park Authority said last Saturday was ""its busiest ever visitor day in living memory"". But one councillor in Bala, which is inside the national park, said it was a different story this weekend. ""It seems to have gone quiet this weekend, at long last,"" said Councillor Dilwyn Morgan. ""I think that people at last have got the message."" On Saturday, Dyfed Powys Police set up check points and patrols at popular sites such as Storey Arms, near Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons. ""There's been a lot of partnership working between the police, Gwynedd Council, the national park and local people to be fair,"" Mr Morgan added. North Wales Police Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said the force had the power to arrest people not adhering to the rules, but said doing so is ""a last resort"". ""We want people to do the right thing and change their lifestyle approach, change what they are doing,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. He said patrol officers turned around ""small numbers"" of people coming into North Wales to go camping and fishing on Friday.

Bat virus clues to origins of Sars,"By Keeren FloraBBC Radio Science Unit Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats which are closely related to the pathogen that infects humans. Critically, the viruses infect human cells in the same way, binding to a receptor called ACE2. This suggests coronaviruses could transfer directly from bats to humans, rather than via an intermediate species like civets as was previously thought. The results are reported in the journal Nature. According to Gary Crameri, virologist at CSIRO and an author on the paper, this research ""is the key to resolving the continued speculation around bats as the origin of the Sars outbreaks"". This Sars-like coronavirus is around 95% genetically similar to the Sars virus in humans, the research shows. And they say it could be used to develop new vaccines and drugs to combat the pathogen. The Sars outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003 resulted in more than 8,000 worldwide cases and more than 770 deaths. This, along with the ongoing endemic of the Mers-coronavirus demonstrates the threat to humans from novel coronaviruses. Dr Peter Daszak is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance and an author on the paper published in Nature. He said: ""Coronaviruses evolve very rapidly. The ones we are seeing are exquisitely evolved to jump from one species to another, which is quite unusual for a virus. So the big question is why are they emerging now?"" At wildlife markets in China other animals and humans come into close proximity with bats, creating an ideal environment for the virus to jump between species. Also, those hunting in or living near bat caves have a significant risk of infection from such viruses, which are excreted in bat faeces. Understanding the origins of infectious diseases like Sars could help scientists tackle future infectious viruses before they emerge, through knowing where they are likely to arise and which families of virus we are most vulnerable to, and taking action to prevent initial infection. Dr Daszak said it would cost ""about $1.5bn to discover all the viruses in mammals. I think that would be a great investment because once you have done it, you can develop vaccines and get ready with test kits to find the first stage of emergence and stop it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Alex Salmond launches Â£103m renewable energy fund,"The Renewable Energy Investment Fund (REIF) aims to attract more private investment to the sector. Its priorities include wave and tidal energy, and renewable district heating. Mr Salmond also announced plans to set up an advisory group to support those seeking finance from the new UK Green Investment Bank and Â£4.3m funding for SSE's offshore turbine test facility. He said the Scottish government would invest the cash in the firm's Hunterston offshore wind turbine test facility. 'Good ideas' The first minister said: ""This fund will help leverage further significant private finance into key areas of the renewables sector where specific funding gaps have been identified. ""The planned advisory group will provide expert advice for people who have good ideas and projects to put to the Green Investment Bank, but who need a helping hand to make them ready for investment. ""The group will help those people to refine and pitch their proposals - by doing so, it should enable the Green Investment Bank to make decisions quickly, and to start investing in projects which will deliver real benefits."" The REIF has been set up following a deal between the UK Treasury and the Scottish government over the release of funds from the fossil fuel levy. The levy was introduced in Scotland in 1996 in order to raise money from traditional energy sources to invest in renewable power. 'Vital catalyst' The new fund aims to complement existing public and private sector finance schemes available in Scotland, providing loan guarantees and equity finance alongside co-investment partners. REIF will be delivered by the Scottish Investment Bank on behalf of the Scottish government and its enterprise agencies, with the first deals expected to be completed by the end of the financial year. Niall Stuart, chief executive of trade body Scottish Renewables, said: ""This Â£103m fund will inject much-needed investment into the development of the next generation of renewable technologies, such as marine energy and renewable heat. ""This kind of support can be a vital catalyst in attracting even greater levels of private investment."" He added: ""Scotland is already at the forefront of developing and testing emerging wave and tidal technologies and, with the correct level of government support, we can become a global centre of excellence in both the deployment of these technologies and their accompanying supply chains."" A UK government spokesman said: ""In November last year, the chancellor and chief secretary announced the Â£103 million of additional funding to be made available to the Scottish Government to support development of renewable energy in Scotland, through the Fossil Fuel Levy fund. ""This has huge potential to create jobs and drive growth, and we are pleased that the funding is being used as announced at the time.

Twitter abuse and bomb threat claims probed by police,"The Met said its central e-crime unit would investigate the claims, including three that were made outside London. On Wednesday, four female journalists, a student and a social media manager said they had received bomb threats. A Labour MP and a feminist campaigner were separately threatened with rape. Police have made two arrests in connection with the rape threats. In a statement, the Met said a centralised investigation of all eight allegations, even though outside its ""operational remit"", would ""make the most effective use of resources, avoid duplication by separate investigation teams and use the expertise and national reach of the [e-crime unit]"". The Guardian's Hadley Freeman, the Independent's Grace Dent and Time magazine's Catherine Mayer all said they had received identical bomb threats on Wednesday. 'Puny' Anonymous tweets warned that bombs would explode outside their homes. The Telegraph's Emma Barnett revealed the following day that she too had received the same threat, and had responded by shutting down her computer and ""rushing out of the office to meet an old contact down the pub"". The anonymous Twitter accounts were suspended and the threatening tweets deleted shortly after they were reported, but not before screen-grabs of the threats had been widely circulated online. Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully fought for a woman's face to appear on Â£10 bank-notes, were threatened on Twitter with rape in separate incidents last weekend. Two men arrested on suspicion of harassment in connection with the allegations have been released on bail by police. A 25-year-old was held by Northumbria Police on 30 July in connection with both allegations, while a 21-year-old was arrested in Manchester on 28 July over the threat against Ms Criado-Perez. Twitter has said it plans to make reporting abuse easier, by bringing a ""report abuse"" function already available on the iPhone app version of the micro-blogging site to other phones and platforms. Ms Mayer said at the time of the threat she had been tempted to ignore and delete the ""not very credible-sounding"" tweet. ""Dick Dastardly might have scripted the threat,"" she wrote later.

Liberia warlord 'Jungle Jabbah' jailed for 30 years in the US,"Mohammed Jabbateh was found guilty of immigration fraud for falsely telling US authorities in the 1990s that he had never belonged to an armed group. One witness told the court how he had ordered the heart of a captive to be cooked for his fighters. Around 250,000 people were killed in Liberia's brutal 14-year civil war. Campaign group Amnesty International has welcomed the verdict as the ""first case to provide some justice for victims of Liberia's civil war"", even though he was not convicted of the atrocities he and his men allegedly carried out. ""It must not be forgotten that there has still been no accountability for these crimes in Liberia itself,"" said Amnesty's West Africa researcher Sabrina Mahtani. ""The Liberian authorities must urgently establish a criminal court to try crimes under international law and ensure those responsible are held to account."" The 51-year-old moved to the US in the late 1990s, living in Pennsylvania in a community in Philadelphia known as ""Little Liberia"" until his arrest in April 2016. The trial was told how he had been a commander in two armed groups - the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (Ulimo) and later the Ulimo-K - during fierce fighting in the early 1990s. Witnesses were flown over from Liberia to give testimony about the allegations of killings, rapes, mutilations and cannibalism committed by him or by fighters under his command. In total there were three accounts of hearts being removed, including how the wife of a town chief was told to cook the heart of a murdered villager and then one of her own husband, a US Department of Justice statement said. Liberia's civil war Is ex-warlord pulling election strings from UK prison? Ex-footballer George Weah faces his toughest challenge US prosecutor William McSwain said: ""This man is responsible for atrocities that will ripple for generations in Liberia. He thought he could hide here but thanks to the determination and creativity of our prosecutors and investigators, he couldn't. ""This prosecution was our only option under the law and his sentence achieves at least some measure of justice for his victims."" According to Civitas Maxima, a Swiss organisation that works to ensure justice for victims of war crimes, many suspects still hold powerful positions in Liberia. Liberian campaigner Hassan Bility says Jabbateh's conviction shows Liberian victims want to be heard. ""Our post-war politicians have not listened to the victims' cries. This will have to change. ""Our hope still remains to see these trials take place in Liberia, so victims of war crimes from all over the country can witness the proceedings.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pakistan rules out offensive against Punjab militants,"By M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad His remarks came hours after he told a parliamentary committee that ""Punjabi Taliban"" were entrenched in southern parts of Punjab. Mr Malik said they were planning to destabilise the country. Few Pakistani officials have acknowledged the existence of militant bases in Punjab despite media reports. Over the past few years Pakistan has been waging a bitter battle against militants in the north of the country. Any suggestion that the war is now spreading to the rest of Pakistan would raise concerns about the country's stability - both at home and abroad. 'Effective action' Mr Malik's comments come days after militants killed more than 90 people in attacks on two mosques of the minority Ahmadi Muslim community in Lahore. The attacks are being blamed on what are called the Punjabi Taliban, a loose alliance of militant groups linked to Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in Pakistan's north-western tribal areas. The Punjab Chief Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, accused Mr Malik of ""provincialism"" for his use of the term ""Punjabi Taliban"". This is the first time a top government minister has acknowledged that militants have bases in southern parts of Punjab province, which houses more than half of the country's population. ""No military operation is planned against banned [militant] outfits in Punjab... [but] effective action would jointly be taken [with the Punjab government] to eliminate them,"" Pakistan's official APP news agency quoted him as telling journalists on Wednesday. Earlier, while briefing a parliamentary interior committee meeting, Mr Malik said groups of ""Punjabi Taliban"" had been involved in attacks in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and elsewhere in Punjab province. He said these groups were entrenched in Punjab and were becoming increasingly dangerous. Most parliamentarians from southern Punjab have been reluctant publicly to admit the existence of militants there, presumably due to reasons of personal security. The ruling party of the Punjab province, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has also sought to dispel media reports that Taliban fighters hailing from Punjab province may have hideouts there. A top minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah, recently attracted criticism for seeking the support of a militant organisation, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, during a by-election in March.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Belfast to host Gradam Ceoil trad music awards until 2021,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The announcement was made as the city hosted the awards and concert for the first time in its 21-year history. Sunday night's ceremony was staged at the Waterfront Hall and was attended by Irish President Michael D Higgins. Participants included Matt Molloy of The Chieftains, members of Altan and De Dannan and the actor Stephen Rea. The Field Marshall Montgomery Pipe Band was among the award-winners, and its members performed at the Gradam Ceoil for the first time. 'Very honoured' The band's pipe-major, Richard Parkes, said their presence sent out an important message about the breadth of traditional music. ""We're the first pipe band to have received an award like this and it's great respect from the traditional music community,"" he said. ""A lot of the tunes that we play are traditional tunes - either traditional Irish or traditional Scottish. ""We're all very pleased and very honoured to receive this award."" The County Armagh-based singer PÃ¡draigÃ­n NÃ­ UallachÃ¡in received a special contribution award, presented by Stephen Rea. 'Unifying force' She also performed two songs during the ceremony and said it was significant that it was being held in Northern Ireland for the first time. ""The awards are the pinnacle for a lot of musicians,"" she said. ""I think for too long the north has been forgotten in the story of traditional music. ""The Troubles had something to do with that but traditional music has been such a unifying force between two sides of the divide in the north. ""I'm not even sure in traditional music there's any divide at all. ""The tradition is a common tradition among Catholics and Protestants - for want of better terms. The same tunes are played and the same songs in English are played. ""So, to celebrate that tradition that kept going through those hard times, it's wonderful to have this in Belfast."" 'Time to grow' The director general for TG4, Alan Esslemont, was in the Waterfront Hall to oversee the live broadcast of the ceremony on the channel. ""We call these the Oscars of traditional music with very good reason,"" he said. ""Over the 21 years, it's really grown. In the same way that the Irish language used to be quite backward-looking, maybe traditional music seemed to have an old-fashioned cache. ""It's now the thing that lots of young people do, both in Ireland and Scotland. This is the right time to come to Belfast."" ""We've never really been invited but we sat with the city council and Northern Ireland Screen and we think this is the right time to come north. ""Being here for four years gives us time to grow into Belfast but also to grow with Belfast and I'm really looking forward to that."" Among the other award winners at Sunday night's ceremony were Frankie Gavin, who was named musician of the year, and Clare Friel who was named young musician of the year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tories and SNP clash over wind power support,"The YouGov poll suggests that a majority of supporters of every party - including Tories - support wind power. But anti-wind farm campaigners arranged a protest at the SNP conference. More than 44,000 objections to wind farm applications in the past five years showed public alarm, they said. The Conservative Party said that figures obtained from 23 of 32 Scottish local authorities showed that about 34,000 objections were submitted to councils. This ranged from an estimated 9,421 in Aberdeenshire, to two objections in East Dunbartonshire. Six other councils have received more than 1,000 objections, ranging from 3,333 in Argyll and Bute to 1,342 in South Ayrshire. 'Ludicrous goals' Around two-fifths of the 44,000 total were received in 2012, the Conservatives claim. Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser, convener of the Scottish Parliament's energy committee, said: ""The tens of thousands of objections right across the country show the sheer level of public alarm at the SNP's wind farm obsession. ""And, what's worse, all too often these concerns are completely ignored by an SNP government intent on fulfilling their own ludicrous renewable energy goals, whatever the cost. ""People aren't just concerned about wind farms ruining their landscape and quality of life, they don't want Scotland's electricity supply dependent on a source that is unreliable and intermittent."" Mr Fraser complained that the Scottish government's SNP administration was disrespecting local views when overturning decisions against wind farms made at council level. However, Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse highlighted the poll suggesting that 77% of SNP supporters, 76% of Liberal Democrat supporters, 68% of Labour supporters and 55% of Conservative supporters ""support the continuing development of wind power as part of a mix of renewable and conventional forms of electricity generation"". Earth Hour The MSP said that a majority of the supporters of each party were also in favour of wind farm developments even when they were in their own area. When asked if they would be for or against the development of large-scale wind energy projects being built in their council area, 77% of SNP supporters, 71% of Liberal Democrat supporters, 64% of Labour supporters and 53% of Conservative supporters said they were in favour. Mr Wheelhouse pointed out that the poll coincided with thousands of people around Scotland taking part in events on Saturday evening in support of WWF's Earth Hour. ""Given that, this year, WWF have chosen the focus of Earth Hour to be renewable energy, I am delighted that new You Gov polling shows cross-party support for wind energy,"" he said. ""Even Tory supporters are in favour of wind power. Clearly, it is time for the Tory politicians to listen to their supporters."" Mr Wheelhouse said that Scotland was a world leader in tackling climate change and in renewable energy - and that the government would continue to pursue its target for renewable energy to produce the equivalent of 100% of electricity from renewables by 2020.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Havelock House: Residents welcome rejection of demolition plans,"The building, on lower Ormeau Road, was vacated in 2018 ahead of a UTV move to new offices on City Quays. London company Olympian Homes bought it in the same year. Its plan was to replace the 150-year-old linen warehouse with an eight-storey apartment building. However, 13 councillors across all parties on the planning committee blocked the demolition at a meeting on Tuesday night. Welcoming the decision, Stephanie Green of the Donegall Pass Community Forum said: ""Residents are so relieved and happy this morning that across all parties, they were listened to and supported."" She explained that the community's objections were on a number of different fronts. 'Sense of belonging' ""This was more than just the fact that a large building would be overshadowing the homes of Donegall Pass, and the fact that only 40 car parking spaces were going to be provided for 500 odd residents, while our area is already overrun by cars parking in every inch of space. ""This was also about the community's connection to this building, the sense of history. ""We've all got our own memories of it, some of us worked there, drivers picked up and dropped off there, it was a place that gave locals a sense of belonging and was seen as something positive in an interface area down the decades."" Before UTV went on air in 1959, the building was the former site of a hemstitching warehouse before becoming a billet for World War Two troops who provided cover for Belfast's bridges. The campaign group 'Save Havelock House', which aims to protect the landmark building, said it holds ""considerable cultural and historical importance"". Media historian Ken Griffen, who leads the group, said it holds ""considerable cultural and historical importance"". ""It played a key role in the birth of Northern Irish television and is the last surviving small station from the pioneering days of UK television,"" said Mr Griffen. ""Somehow, the developers convinced the city's planners that the building has no heritage value. So there's been no consideration of its historic worth or a proper public consultation or advertisement process."" Olympian Homes have been contacted for a response.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dog's dinner: DNA clue to how dogs became our friends,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Our canine companions developed the ability to digest starchy foods during the farming revolution thousands of years ago, according to DNA evidence. Scientists think dogs may have been domesticated from wolves when they came into settlements, scrounging for food. Modern dogs can tolerate starch-rich diets, unlike their wolf cousins, which are carnivores. A study of DNA extracted from the bones and teeth of ancient dogs at archaeological sites in Europe and Asia suggests their ability to eat starchy foods goes back millennia. Lead researcher Dr Morgane Ollivier of ENS de Lyon, France, said human cultural development has influenced the first domesticated animal, the dog. DNA samples from 8,000 to 4,000 years ago show the dog's ability to digest starch is ancient - hailing back to a time when hunter-gatherer societies adopted agriculture. ""As it was absent in samples coming from hunter-gatherers' contexts, we linked it to the development of agriculture in early farming society,"" Dr Ollivier told BBC News. ""This probably constituted an important selective advantage for dogs feeding on human leftovers within a farming context. ""It's a lovely example of parallel evolution of human culture (emergence of agriculture) and the dog genome."" Taming wolves Scientists are divided over how dogs became domesticated from wolves. One suggestion is that ancient hunter-gatherers used wolves as hunting companions or guards, gradually training and taming them. But others argue that domestication started later, when wolves stole food leftovers from settlements and began to live alongside people. The new research, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, looked at ancient DNA from dog bones at eight archaeological sites in Europe and Turkmenistan. It adds weight to the idea that dogs became domesticated when they crept into human settlements to steal food, gradually evolving the ability to thrive on a human diet. A previous study found that modern dogs have genes for digesting starches, setting them apart from wolves. The dog is estimated to have split from the wolf around 15,000 years ago. Exactly how and when humankind's relationship with dogs began is still a matter of debate. And some propose that domestication of dogs may have happened several times during history.

South East hospitals charged Â£1.5m for ambulance delays,"Patient handovers should not take longer than 15 minutes. Hospitals are charged Â£2.44 for each extra minute. Jonathan Fox, from the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, said delays kept crews from other jobs. But Rob Way, a consultant nurse at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, said its waiting times were improving. The charges are from South Central Ambulance Service. It serves hospitals in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire. 'Life-threatening emergency' Mr Fox said calls to the service had increased by 12% in the past year, from 432,000 to 495,000. ""The more calls you respond to the more patients you take to hospital and obviously the law of unintended consequences is you end up with significant delays. ""What the delays are doing is making it more difficult for ambulance staff to become available for the next emergency, which could be a serious or life-threatening emergency."" Chris Ringwood, from The Patients Voice, said: ""I would like to see the hospital and the ambulance service do a little bit of joined up thinking. ""The ambulance service is there to take people to hospital. It's up to the hospital to take charge of the patient as soon as possible."" The John Radcliffe Hospital said it had recently changed its procedures to bring delays down. 'More efficient' Patients previously went through two handovers which have been reduced to one. Mr Way said it had brought average times down from 20 minutes to 12. He added: ""It's made the process more efficient so that the ambulance crews are able to hand over to the nurses co-ordinating the emergency department so they can go and respond to the next calls that are coming in to them."" The John Radcliffe Hospital said it would be helping other trusts to bring their handover times down too. Southampton General Hospital was charged for 3,059 hours of waiting time during the 2010/11 period. The John Radcliffe Hospital delays amounted to 2,249 hours, the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth 2,168 hours and the Royal Berkshire Hospital 2,063. Delays have more than doubled at North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke and Horton Hospital in Banbury in the past two years.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fire-hit Harrington Junior School to be rebuilt on site,"Harrington Junior School, in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, was gutted in the blaze on 28 May, started accidentally during refurbishment work. No children were inside at the time and everyone got out safely. The head teacher said there was no timescale for rebuilding but all pupils would be back on site in September in temporary accommodation. The school was built in the 1960s and 1970s and has 235 pupils. After the fire, it was revealed the school did not have sprinklers but recently had fire doors fitted. At the time, Derbyshire County Council, which oversees Harrington, said the school was not fitted with sprinklers ""in line with building regulations due to the age of the building"". Andy Dark, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) assistant general secretary, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service regulations over fire safety were not tight enough. ""Loose regulation has left companies and councils able to take shortcuts that, ultimately, put lives at risk,"" he said. ""We cannot allow that to continue happening in our schools. It's essential that the prime minister makes clear that safety is the highest priority in the building and refurbishment of schools and further education colleges and that the fitting of sprinkler systems becomes the norm."" The FBU added ""just 105 sprinkler systems were fitted in the 673 new schools built in England last year"" but they are mandatory in Wales and Scotland. 'Will be rebuilt' A Department for Education spokesperson said all schools are required to have ""an up-to-date fire risk assessment"" and conduct regular fire drills. ""Where sprinklers are considered necessary to protect pupils and staff, they must be installed,"" the spokesperson added. Head teacher Rachael Wilmot said over the past few weeks, pupils had been taught in the family centre in Long Eaton as the search continued for further temporary premises. Mrs Wilmot said: ""In the long-term, Harrington will be rebuilt and we will have a new school. There is no time scale for this at present as we are just in the early stages of planning.""

New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague,"The former foreign secretary warned of the risk of a ""hate-filled"" campaign if the government attempted to revisit the issue and tell people ""they were wrong"" when voting to leave in 2016. He said he would be ""more likely"" to vote leave if there was another poll. ""You can't go around in circles. We have to stick to the decision."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the UK's negotiations with the EU had taken a ""fairly predictable"" course up to now and it was incumbent on both sides to try and secure a breakthrough. Lord Hague, a Remain supporter who left frontline politics in 2015, said that while quitting the EU without a deal could not be ruled out, he believed it would not be a good outcome. Neither the Conservatives nor Labour support another referendum on the terms of the UK's exit but MPs are demanding a vote in Parliament on the deal negotiated by Theresa May's government - although this is unlikely to prevent the UK from leaving in March 2019. The Lib Dems have said the public are entitled to change their mind and should be given a final say on the withdrawal agreement in what they have claimed would be the ""first referendum on the facts"". But the former Conservative leader suggested that would be calamitous for the country, given that more people had voted to leave the EU in June 2016 - when 17.4 million people, or 51.9% of those turning out, backed Leave - than had voted for any government in British history. ""It would be the most divisive event in this country since the arguments over Irish home rule at least, to try and go back over this issue,"" he said. ""Imagine going back to the people of this country and saying 'you got this wrong in the referendum, you may have turned out in record numbers and most of the country voted to leave but nevertheless we think you got it wrong and we are going to run it again'. ""Imagine the hate-filled campaign that would divide this country. I do not think that is a price worth paying.""

MSPs back Scottish smacking ban proposals,"A bill lodged by Green MSP John Finnie is designed to give children the same protection from assault as adults. MSPs voted by 80 to 29 in favour of the proposals - with the Conservatives voting against - after its first stage debate. The bill has been backed by the Scottish government, which had previously opposed an outright ban. It will now go to a Holyrood committee, where it will be considered in greater detail before MSPs are asked to give their final approval so it can become law. Parents in Scotland are currently able to claim a defence of ""justifiable assault"" when punishing their child - although the use of an ""implement"" in any punishment is banned, as is shaking or striking a child on the head. Mr Finnie's bill would end that defence, meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, parents are currently allowed to use ""reasonable chastisement"", but can face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches. The Welsh government is also considering an outright ban on smacking. Mr Finnie said 54 countries across the world already prohibit the physical punishment of children, and his bill would bring Scotland into line with international best practice. He told the debate that it was ""time for action"" as he said: ""A growing body of international evidence shows that physical punishment of children is harmful to their development and not an effective means of discipline."" He added: ""We often in Scotland talk about zero tolerance for domestic abuse and violence, but we allow the use of physical punishment for children. ""This sends a message to our children that hitting someone is a way of resolving a dispute, or if you don't like their behaviour."" A public consultation on the issue in 2017 received more than 650 responses, with about 75% being in favour of the ban. Mr Finnie's proposals have also been backed by children's charities and the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents. Two SNP MSPs - Christine Grahame and Richard Lyle - abstained in the vote. And the Conservatives argued that banning smacking is unnecessary and risks criminalising parents for disciplining their own children. Tory MSP Oliver Mundell stressed that violence against children was wrong, but argued that the bill was an ""assault on family life"" as it would see the state intervene in cases where a child's welfare is not at risk. However Children's Minister Maree Todd said the government's intention was not to criminalise parents, but instead to end the ""antiquated"" defence of justifiable assault. Ms Todd also said the concept that it can sometimes be reasonable to strike a child was ""completely at odds with our aim for Scotland to be the best place in the world for children to grow up"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Algerian army 'kills jihadist behind Herve Gourdel beheading',"Abdelmalek Gouri and two associates were shot dead late on Monday in the town of Isser, a statement said. His group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS) in mid-September. Days later, it seized Mr Gourdel in the Djurdjura mountains and killed him in response to French air strikes on IS. The Algerian army subsequently launched a major operation to track down members of Jund al-Khilafa, which has seen several of them killed. 'Explosive belts' The defence ministry statement said the operation in Isser began at 22:30 (21:30 GMT) on Monday after intelligence was received and a vehicle carrying militants was seen entering the town, 60km (37 miles) east of Algiers. After Gouri and the two other members of Jund al-Khilafa were killed, troops recovered two automatic rifles, explosive belts, a large quantity of ammunition and mobile phones, it added. No other people were reported injured in the clashes. On Saturday, the army announced that it had killed three other militants in a mountainous area near the village Sidi Daoud, 25km (15) miles to the north-west of Isser. It said one of them was a ""dangerous criminal"". And on 11 December, the justice ministry said soldiers had killed two members of Jund al-Khilafa implicated in the murder of Mr Gourdel. The newspaper Ennahar cited security sources as saying the group mostly comprised former members of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). On 14 September, Jund al-Khilafa broke away from AQIM, accusing it of ""deviating from the true path"", and pledging allegiance to IS leader and self-proclaimed ""caliph"" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group kidnapped Mr Gourdel in Djurdjura National Park on 21 September. Three days later it published a video that appeared to show him being beheaded after its demand that France end its air strikes on IS positions in Iraq was not met. Gouri, also known as Khaled Abou Slimane, was once considered the ""right-hand man"" of AQIM leader Abdelmalek Droukdel and was part of the cell behind suicide attacks on the government's headquarters and the UN compound in Algiers in 2007, Ennahar said. He was also behind an attack in Iboudrarene in April that left 11 soldiers dead, the newspaper added. Who are Jund al-Khilafa?

"Wage inequality lowest in Wales, says ONS figures","By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent The highest paid 1% of Welsh workers earn on average Â£41.20 an hour, seven times the wage of the lowest paid Welsh workers on Â£5.91 an hour. The inequality gap has narrowed since 1998, when the highest paid earned nine times as much as the lowest. Across the UK, the richest employees earn 10 times more than the poorest. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has analysed earnings across the UK and across 25 years. It found that the average employee earns 62% more in real terms than they did in 1986. The average full-time employee in the UK earned around Â£12.62 per hour excluding overtime, in April 2011. That's a cash increase of 226% since 1986 when the average wage was Â£3.87 per hour. Wales not only has the lowest ratio of wage inequality in the UK, according to these figures. But also the wage gap in Wales has narrowed since 1998 when the highest paid employees earned more than nine times the rate of the lowest earners. London has the greatest wage inequality with top earners getting more than 16 times that of low earners. The statistics also show the jobs where you can earn the most - and least. The highest paid are airline pilots and flight engineers, with average pay of Â£44.49 an hour. Not far behind are chief executives and senior officials (Â£39.24 per hour) and advertising and public relations directors (Â£33.43). Wales has fewer of these top jobs than other parts of the UK, notably London, which may explain the smaller gap between the earnings of our highest and lowest paid employees. The ONS point out there may be individuals, such as sports stars and entertainers, who earn considerably more. Self-employed people also aren't covered in the statistics. The lowest paid occupations in the UK economy in 2011 were waiters/waitresses and bar staff, where the average gross hourly pay was Â£6.25 excluding overtime. The third lowest paid occupation is kitchen and catering assistants (Â£6.30 an hour). The ONS says the average pay for these occupations reflects the skills needed and the numbers competing for jobs in these areas, which drives down wages. Jobs that pay the most are usually being done by older people, who have developed skills over a number of years to become a senior official or chief executive. The occupations paying the least have a higher concentration of younger people working in them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Birmingham voters reject elected mayor plan,"Birmingham was among 10 English cities voting in mayoral referendums on the same day as the local council elections. In Birmingham 57.8% voted no. Eight other cities have rejected plans to replace local council cabinets with directly elected mayors. People backed the idea in Bristol, where the contest for the new job will take place in the autumn. A total of 120,611 people voted no, while 88,085 backed the proposal, Birmingham City Council said. Former Labour MP Sion Simon, who quit his Birmingham Erdington seat before the 2010 general election to stand as an elected mayor, said on a personal level it was ""a massive gamble"" and he was ""very disappointed"". Mr Simon added: ""Sometimes you do things, take a risk, because you believe in something and it doesn't come off. ""But it was never really about me. It was about the city and it was about the change that we need in Birmingham."" 'Accountable democracy' The new leader of the now Labour-controlled council, Sir Albert Bore, who had announced his backing for would-be mayor Liam Byrne, said he had always taken the view it was for residents to decide on the governance of the city. He said: ""For 12 years I've argued for an elected mayor for Birmingham and I've maintained that, even though I gave up the idea of becoming myself the first elected mayor of Birmingham."" Mr Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said an elected mayor for Birmingham was now ""off the table"", according to BBC Midlands political editor Patrick Burns.

Covid: Highest weekly deaths in Wales since pandemic began,"There were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before. This was nearly 40% of all registered deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Both Betsi Cadwaladr and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards saw their highest weekly numbers, more than experienced during the first wave. Betsi Cadwaladr had 74 deaths while Cwm Taf Morgannwg had 116. Unlike during the peak in the first wave in 2020, Wales is also now seeing higher numbers of deaths in north Wales and west Wales. In north-east Wales, where there have been the highest case rates of Covid-19 in recent weeks, there were 30 deaths of Flintshire residents, including 25 in hospital. In Wrexham, there were 27 deaths - with 21 in hospital. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board saw 49 hospital deaths in Bridgend - the highest weekly number in Wales. There were also 33 patients who died in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and six in Merthyr Tydfil. All counties recorded at least three deaths involving Covid-19 and the total number of deaths in Wales, up to and registered by 15 January, was 5,884. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is now a total of 6,074. RCT, with 752 deaths, has the largest number in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 637, up to the latest week. When looking at crude mortality rates, the highest number of deaths - when taking into account the size of populations in England and Wales - are Welsh areas: RCT, followed by Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent. What about 'excess deaths'? So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell from 1,198 in the previous week - the highest recorded during the pandemic - to 1,170. But this was still 314 (36.7%) higher than the five-year average for that week. This means deaths have been more than the peak in the first wave of the pandemic - 1,169 deaths in the week ending 17 April 2020 - for two weeks in a row. The highest proportion of excess deaths was 84.1% in London. Related Internet Links ONS",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Belarus: Journalists covering protests stripped of accreditation,"Two journalists with the BBC's Russian service are among those affected. In a statement, the BBC said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this stifling of independent journalism"". Fresh demonstrations against the government broke out on Saturday. Belarus is gripped by mass protests, triggered by an election widely believed to have been rigged in favour of the long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko. On Saturday, several thousand women - many in national dress - rallied in the capital, Minsk, waving flags and flowers in what they called a ""march of Solidarity"", urging Mr Lukashenko and the government to resign. Riot police were out in force and made several arrests. Smaller rallies took place in other parts of Belarus, and come on the eve of what is expected to be another turbulent Sunday of post-election protests. The BBC has urged the Belarusian authorities to allow access to its reporters. ""We believe it is vital for the people of Belarus to have access to impartial, independent information about events in their country. BBC Russian, which reaches more than five million people a week, has been a major source of news for people in Belarus and Russia during the post-election unrest,"" it said. Government spokesman Anatoly Glaz told AFP news agency the action was taken following a recommendation from the country's counter-terrorism unit. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he condemned the move and had raised his concerns with Belarusian officials. Austria's foreign ministry described the action against journalists as a blatant attempt to suppress objective reporting. At least 10 local and several Russian journalists lost their accreditation on Saturday, with Radio Liberty, AFP, and Deutsche Welle among the other outlets affected. The announcement came days after multiple journalists - including a BBC team - were detained in Minsk ahead of a protest. The interior ministry said they had been taken to a police station for identity checks. However, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg, who was among those detained, said it was a ""clear attempt to interfere with coverage of events"". What's the background? Unrest in Belarus was triggered earlier this month by an election widely believed to have been rigged in favour of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. The leading opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, fled to Lithuania following the vote and has since called for protests. The country has seen unprecedented opposition demonstrations and workers have staged walkouts at major state enterprises. Thousands have been arrested and there have been numerous reports of police brutality. At least four people have died and hundreds have been injured. The European Union and the US are among those to reject the election as neither free nor fair. The EU is preparing sanctions against officials it accuses of rigging the result to deliver Mr Lukashenko's victory and of cracking down on the opposition movement.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Over 300 patients refuse ambulance over Covid-19 fears,"Toby Lewis, chief executive of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, said hospitals are now ""much clearer"" about how to manage the infection. The number of cases related to patients visited by West Midlands Ambulance Service in early April. A new service will be put in place next week to make sure a follow-up is made. Speaking at the weekly West Midlands Combined Authority briefing, Mr Lewis said it was important not to give people with acute conditions the sense it is ""more risky"" to go to hospital than to stay at home. ""We are open for people who do not think they have Covid-19, but they may be concerned about a stroke, a heart attack... ""Over 300 patients in the last little while, who were asked by an ambulance crew to go to hospital, declined to be transported. ""We are following up each of those individuals to make sure they are being looked after. ""But it's really important that in the messaging about social distancing and staying at home, we do not create a sense that it is more risky to go to hospital than it is to nurture your condition and become progressively more unwell."" The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Mr Lewis' comments follow the news Birmingham City Councillor Mohammed Aikhlaq MBE was too scared to call 999 because two close friends with the illness had died after being admitted. The 60-year-old father-of-two, who has heart problems, diabetes and high blood pressure, became ill with a sore throat and coughing after returning to Birmingham following a four-week trip to Pakistan. His symptoms became worse and he went on to develop breathing problems. He was advised to stay in isolation but to call 999 if it got worse, but said he did not want to go to hospital. At one point he was on the verge of calling his daughter to say goodbye, he said, but after a month of isolation he has made a slow recovery.

Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision',"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off due to mistakes in the care of Jack Adcock, six, after a criminal trial. The Court of Appeal heard her removal for a ""one-off mistake"" had robbed the NHS of a ""young and talented"" doctor. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said any other sanction undermined its rules and her manslaughter conviction. Jack died from septic shock at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011, hours after being admitted with sickness and vomiting. Dr Bawa-Garba's 2015 trial heard Jack, who had Down's Syndrome and a heart condition, was the subject of a ""catalogue"" of errors including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking he was under a do-not-resuscitate order. She was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence and sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years. Subsequently Dr Bawa-Garba was suspended from the medical register for 12 months by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal (MPT) in June 2017. However, the General Medical Council (GMC) appealed, saying this was ""not sufficient to protect the public"", and erasure was substituted for the lesser sanction of a year's suspension. The move was upheld by the High Court in January. At the Court of Appeal, Dr Bawa-Garba's counsel, James Laddie QC said the case was ""something of a lightning rod for the dissatisfaction of doctors and medical staff in this country"". Medics had been ""baffled and angered"" by the dismissal of Dr Bawa-Garba ""who, it is agreed, poses no risk to patient safety,"" he said. Mr Laddie suggested the MPT's decision to suspend rather than strike off Dr Bawa-Garba was ""humane and balanced"". He also paid tribute to Jack's parents who had campaigned for justice in the case and attended the hearing. ""Our arguments are not intended to diminish their sense of loss, but we submit in this sensitive area that public confidence in the medical profession demands, or at least permits, a sanction other than erasure to be applied,"" he added. In written argument, Ivan Hare QC for the GMC, said the appeal should be dismissed because the High Court was correct to decide the MPT ""undermined the 2004 Fitness to Practise Rules and the jury's verdict by reaching its own conclusion on Dr Bawa-Garba's individual culpability"". The hearing continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
EasyJet hopes to reopen 75% of route network by August,"The airline is already starting limited services this month, as it adjusts to the coronavirus collapse in air travel. Customers and cabin crew must wear face masks, and no food will be served. EasyJet is axing 4,500 jobs, and could be ejected from the FTSE 100 this week because its share price has tumbled. However, news of a slow return to services, along with what the airline claimed was its biggest ever summer promotion, helped to push EasyJet's share price 2.75% higher on Tuesday. EasyJet said half of its network would be reopened by the end of July, increasing to 75% during August. ""Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September,"" the airline said. The carrier said services would operate from all its UK bases. EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, with flights mainly restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France. Rival Ryanair has operated a very limited schedule of flights during the pandemic, and has said it is planning to resume 40% of its ""normal flight schedules"" in July. EasyJet is introducing a series of safety measures, including requiring passengers to wear face masks at airports and on aircraft. It has produced thousands of face mask covers inspired by comic books to be handed to children flying on selected routes in an attempt to ease their anxiety about the new rule. Spain doubts Other steps to boost hygiene include not selling food during flights, enhanced cleaning of planes, and disinfection wipes and hand sanitiser being provided. Passengers will be invited to sit away from people not in their party on flights with empty seats. EasyJet's chief commercial and planning officer, Robert Carey, said: ""We are delighted to announce that we will be flying the majority of our route network across Europe, meaning customers can still get to their chosen destination for their summer holidays this year."" The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors since the UK and other countries went into lockdown. Aviation bosses are in talks with the UK government about controversial quarantine measures And on Monday, Spain's tourism minister cast doubt on the prospect of an early return by UK holidaymakers to Spanish beaches. MarÃ­a Reyes Maroto said British coronavirus figures ""still have to improve"" before Spain could receive tourists from the UK. EasyJet says its planned destinations include Spain and other major European tourist hotspots, but the final list and timings will only emerge as various country restrictions are eased and customer demand increases.

Why we need internet jokes and memes more than ever,"By Will ChalkNewsbeat reporter But how closely are the two linked and what does that say about our mindsets, the internet and our society? Yeah. We're tackling some big questions. And, while we're at it, we might as well look at some funny pictures. The week's biggest political meme came in the form of Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Leader of the House of Commons was royally told off by other MPs for his posture during a Brexit debate. It prompted mash-ups with everything from The Simpsons to 17th Century art. ""We're in a very complex political moment and we're trying to find where we fit in it and who's with us and who's not quite so much with us - to put it nicely,"" Dr Richard Clay tells Newsbeat. He's a professor of Digital Cultures at Newcastle University and recently made a documentary about memes. He says we use them to learn, to share - and to find out who's on our side. ""If you use The Simpsons, for example, some people are going to think it's really funny and get the reference to The Simpsons as well as to Rees-Mogg - and they're going to be part of your tribe. ""Whereas others are going to really resent it and see it as diminishing a member of parliament they regard as a great leader of the Brexit mission. ""Transforming an old master painting into a Jacob Rees-Mogg meme creates yet another tribe."" Of course, Jacob Rees-Mogg isn't the only part of what's been a frankly incredible week that has got attention online. Many people have used the whole situation as their source material. ""You get an upsurge in meme production when people are particularly intense about their feelings and their thoughts about what's going on at the time,"" Richard adds. ""It's a kind of steam valve that releases the pressure and the tension and allows people to calm down. That's what satirical humour has always done. ""There's a really interesting, huge body of evidence that's being produced daily worldwide that gives us an insight into what's going on right now."" He says it's an ""exciting"" time because ""pretty much anybody can leave a mark which future generations will be able to find"". ""In 50 years time historians will be looking at the memes that were being produced during Brexit or the Trump campaign and they'll be using it as evidence to give us an insight into how people thought about these struggles at the time.""

Belfast floods: Response to ordeal comes under fire,"Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy said the ""flood line did not perform as it should have"". The flood incident line is operated by the Department of Finance and Personnel, headed by Sammy Wilson. Mr Wilson admitted staff had been ""overwhelmed"". SDLP MLA Conall McDevitt said parts of south Belfast had been a ""scene of devastation"". He said although it was an exceptionally bad night, he criticised both Northern Ireland Water and the Roads Service and said they had been ""caught off-guard"". ""The response was totally inadequate, the call handling facility collapsed,"" he said. Mr Wilson apologised to people who were unable to get through to the flooding helpline on Wednesday evening. ""The speed and the volume of rainfall last night was unprecedented by any account, and with no warning from the Met Office, we did not have the necessary people in place,"" he said. ""The department tried to rectify this as quickly as possible and arranged for staff to come in to take the calls - unfortunately a significant number of calls were abandoned and this is not an acceptable practice."" He said there needed to be a ministerial discussion about how any response could be co-ordinated. First Minister Peter Robinson, who was at Belfast City Hall on Wednesday night, was briefed by officials but said Northern Ireland's infrastructure needed to improve. ""This is soul destroying for the people who have been affected,"" he said. ""This is the kind of weather we can expect year on year and I think we need to have the kind of infrastructure that's going to deal with it. ""That will require very significant funding. It will require the executive to look at its priorities but I think a very strong case can be made."" Sara Venning of Northern Ireland Water has defended its response. ""Across Northern Ireland and across Belfast the NI Water infrastructure was operational,"" she said. ""So this flooding did not occur because of equipment failure, this flooding occurred because of extremes of weather conditions."" Meanwhile, Belfast City Council is co-ordinating the response to the crisis in the city and is operating a free flooding advice line. The number is 0800 707 6965 and the council has inspectors on stand-by to respond as soon as possible. It said that while water levels were currently reduced there were still a number of specific sites around the city that remained affected, particularly in the east of the city and a ""high alert"" was in place to deal with further downpours as the day progresses. Dr Anne Wilson, Public Health Consultant for the Public Health Agency, said the main risk in relation to flooding was ""caused by hidden dangers under the water such as missing manhole covers or people falling into fast flowing waters"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Big Bang Theory scoops Critics' Choice TV Awards,"The show was named best comedy series, while its stars Simon Helberg and Kaley Cuoco were named best supporting actor and actress respectively. There was a tie for best drama, with Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad sharing the award. Bryan Cranston was named best actor in a drama for the latter series.

The awards were handed out by the Broadcast Television Journalists Association. A full list of winners is on the Critics' Choice website.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police inquiry over white-tailed eagle nest claim,"By David MillerBBC Scotland environment correspondent Conservationists said it was the first nest made by white-tailed eagles in the east of Scotland in about 150 years. Officers are looking into claims that a tree containing the nest was felled on the Invermark Estate in January. White-tailed eagles, and their nests, are protected by law. It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly damage or destroy nests being built or in use. RSPB Scotland claimed the estate had been warned that eagles were nesting in the tree. It was also claimed the nest was lined with moss and fresh down. The organisation said the loss of the nest meant there would be no breeding pairs of white-tailed eagles in the east of Scotland this year. Duncan Orr Ewing, of RSPB Scotland, said: ""I was totally appalled and I think most right-minded people would have the same reaction. ""Here is a species that is being brought back as part of international conservation efforts, and we appear to have one individual or a couple of individuals who are undermining that conservation effort."" Invermark Estate has rejected the allegations, and insisted it is proud of its conservation record. A spokesman said: ""Any suggestion that the estate or its employees, who are highly trained and implement extensive conservation programmes, would jeopardise or disrupt species that have made this estate their home, is disputed in the strongest possible terms."" A spokesman for the landowners' organisation, Scottish Land and Estates, said: ""There is a worrying trend in these matters that certain people take the irresponsible view that accusations can be made anonymously through the media, in the middle of police investigations, with the objective of hoping that mud sticks and an estate can be portrayed as being guilty until proven innocent."" In a separate development, Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse MSP, told BBC Scotland he is set to introduce new measures designed to tackle the persecution of birds of prey. He said: ""Even those stakeholders who represent landowners and the sporting interests recognise that there are those who seem hell bent on ignoring the law and the clear will of parliament and the people of Scotland to protect our natural environment. ""We are reaching the point where we do have to take further steps to reinforce that message and ensure that while we don't want to punish those that are doing good things, we target our efforts at those who are clearly ignoring their responsibilities.""

Census 2020: US adds controversial citizenship question,"A dozen US states are suing to block the move, saying it will deter immigrants from participating. Trump administration officials say the data will help the government allocate resources and enforce voter laws designed to prevent discrimination. The census is mandated under the US constitution and takes place every 10 years, counting every resident. What are political implications? Census data helps the US government calculate funding distribution and draw up districts for state and local elections. Democratic states with large immigrant populations argue a citizenship question will produce undercounts because fewer people will participate. They fear losing congressional and state legislature seats along with federal funding. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Reuters news agency the question exposed ""xenophobic and anti-immigrant policy positions from [the Trump] administration"". What does Trump administration say? The US Department of Commerce , which oversees the census, said on Monday night it had added the question after a request from the Department of Justice. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the 1965 Voting Rights Act required a tally of citizens of voting age to ensure minority groups were not discriminated against. He said even if the citizenship question had an effect on responses, ""the value of more complete and accurate data derived from surveying the entire population outweighs such concerns"". Mr Ross' agency pointed out that other, smaller population surveys also ask respondents whether they are American citizens. His agency has until the end of this month to submit a final list of 2020 census questions to Congress. ""The purpose is to determine individuals who are here,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. ""I think that it is going to determine the individuals in our country and provide information that allows us to comply with our own laws and procedures,"" she added. President Donald Trump has previously argued, without providing evidence, that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 presidential election. What do critics say? New York and California, which have large immigrant populations, are among at least 12 states taking legal action to block the move. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra applied early on Tuesday for a court to rule that such a census question would violate the US constitution. He argued it would interfere with the US government's obligation to conduct a full count of the population. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the citizenship question would ""create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities"". He also said it would ""make impossible both an accurate Census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars"". The top law enforcement officers of 19 states wrote to the commerce secretary in February to oppose the ""tremendous harms"" that they say the question would have.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
No cause of death for Eric Garner after New York arrest,"Eric Garner, 43, was forcibly detained on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes on Thursday. Video of the incident shows Garner complain he couldn't breathe as a police officer appeared to put his arm around Garner's neck. Two officers and four emergency responders have been placed on modified duty pending an investigation. ""At this time, no determination has been made by the medical examiner's office as to the cause and manner of death of Eric Garner,"" medical examiner spokeswoman Julie Bolcer told US media. ""The cause and manner of death are pending further studies, and no findings will be released until the investigation is complete."" The 350lb (159kg) man had reportedly been sitting down outside a beauty salon in Staten Island when police approached him and said they had observed him selling loose cigarettes. ""Before they even grabbed him, he told them he wasn't feeling good and that's why I pulled the camera out and started recording,"" witness Ramsey Orta told the Associated Press news agency. In a video of the incident, obtained by the New York Daily News, Garner can be seen arguing with officers as they attempted to detain him, saying: ""Do not touch me."" An officer put his arm around Garner's neck and several other men forced him down on to the sidewalk, where he could be heard saying: ""I can't breathe."" Garner is said to have been arrested 31 times since 1988 on charges including drug possession and assault. Following his death, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD [New York Police Department]"". Prosecutors and police investigators also launched inquiries into Garner's death. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer identified as putting Garner in a chokehold, was stripped of his badge and gun pending results of the investigations. Another unidentified police officer, said to be Mr Pantaleo's partner, was also placed on desk duty according to police officials. Four emergency responders, said to be employees of an ambulance service which responded to the incident, have also been placed on modified duty pending an inquiry. The Reverent Al Sharpton spoke at a rally in Harlem on Saturday, saying: ""There is clearly no reason, when a man is saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' that you maintain this chokehold.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Health regulator problems 'persist',"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News The Care Quality Commission (CQC) was only created in 2009 but has been under fire virtually ever since. The House of Commons' Health Select Committee said the CQC had still failed to grasp its primary role to ensure patient safety. Previous reports have found recruitment problems have meant the quantity and quality of inspections have suffered. Now the new review by the cross-party group said despite some recent improvements it was was not yet back on track. Eighteen months ago the committee had produced a report which said the CQC had developed a ""tick-box culture"" and lost sight of its main role - to protect patients. The report prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to criticise the organisation and this was followed by another attack by the National Audit Office a year ago and an official performance review by the Department of Health. Its work also came under scrutiny after abuse at the Winterbourne View residential home near Bristol came to light. Since then the CQC has lost its chief executive, while its chair is due to leave soon. Public confidence The MPs acknowledged the organisation was now aware of the changes it had to make, while new inspectors have been taken on. But the committee said the CQC had not yet successfully defined its core purpose or earned public confidence. It suggested its inspections needed to be more challenging and that when problems were identified ensure providers of care were addressing them rapidly. Committee chairman Stephen Dorrell said: ""The CQC's primary focus should be to ensure that the public has confidence that its inspections provide an assurance of acceptable standards in care and patient safety. ""We do not believe that the CQC has yet succeeded in this this objective."" David Behan, the CQC's new chief executive, said the regulator had carried out a strategic review and was in the process of making changes. ""We will ensure that openness and transparency are at the heart of the way we develop. ""We are focused on protecting and promoting the health, safety and welfare of people who use health and care services."" Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, said feedback from his members showed many did not have confidence the CQC would be fit for purpose this year. But he said the new leadership at the regulator had brought ""strong expertise"" for the future. ""It is in everybody's interest to have a strong and respected regulator for health and social care in place,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Royal Cornwall Hospital 'neglected' woman who died in A&E,"Katy Lowry, 30, who had chromosomal abnormalities and learning difficulties, was taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital on 13 December 2016. She had been vomiting every 15 minutes for nearly 24 hours. Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon concluded Miss Lowry died of natural causes, contributed to by neglect. She said the failure to carry out basic observations and adequate assessment on Miss Lowry when she arrived at the hospital had ""led or contributed to her death"". Her fatal collapse happened about two-and-a-half hours after arriving at the hospital and she could not be resuscitated. More Cornwall stories here Expert witness and consultant surgeon Andrew Wyman said if observations had been taken and treatment of IV fluids and antibiotics had been started Miss Lowry would not have died. Nurse Simon Taylor, who had been on triage duty, said he decided not to take Miss Lowry's observations as she would have needed to have taken some of her clothing off - something he felt would be ""inappropriate"". The inquest heard Mr Taylor had said in an interview following the incident he had very little time to triage each patient and undressing Miss Lowry would have taken ""a lot of time"" because she was in a wheelchair. In evidence he denied he had said this. 'Gross failure' The inquest heard a number of opportunities were missed to take the observations. The omission was described as a ""gross failure"" by the hospital's chief nurse Kim O'Keefe, who apologised ""unreservedly"" on behalf of the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust for Miss Lowry's death. Miss Lowry's medical cause of death was recorded as pulmonary aspiration due to hiatus hernia and acute cholecystitis - inflammation of the gall bladder. In a statement, Miss Lowry's brother Christopher said the family had wanted to know the true cause of his sister's death. ""Was this detectable, treatable and her death preventable, and sadly we know now the answer is 'yes' to all three,"" he said. He added: ""Katy, we miss your laughter, your singing, your sparkly shoes and socks and your pennies left all over the house, we even miss the sound of your noisy toys. All of our lives are less colourful now."" Vaughan Temby from DisAbility Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, said: ""Katy would still be here if she had not been viewed as a disabled person first but as a patient first."" In a statement after the hearing Mrs O'Keeffe said Miss Lowry's death ""should not have happened"". She said: ""Over the past 12 months we have been strenuously working to be an Improving Trust in safety, governance and delay and we are committed to learning from the investigation into Katy's care.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: France warns UK of bitter trade negotiations,"French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" as they strove for advantage in the negotiations. He also said it would be tough for the UK to achieve its aim of agreeing a free trade deal by the end of the year. The UK government said it wanted a deal based on ""friendly co-operation between sovereign equals"". Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator is expected to give more details of the UK's negotiating aims in a speech in Brussels later. David Frost is expected to say the UK will be happy with a trade deal based on that agreed by the EU with Canada in 2016 but to rule out any form of regulatory alignment with the bloc from 2021 onwards. The UK formally left the EU two weeks ago but still trades like a member under a transition period which ends on 31 December. Talks on their future relationship are set to begin next month once the EU's 27 members have agreed the bloc's negotiating mandate. Speaking at a security conference in Munich on Sunday, Mr Le Drian said the two sides were far apart on a range of issues. He said: ""I think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations, which we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart. ""But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests."" Mr Le Drian, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, is the latest senior EU figure to warn that the negotiations will be difficult. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and chief negotiator Michel Barnier have both cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year. The EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards. Last week the European Parliament called for the UK to follow EU rules in a host of areas, such as chemicals regulation, food labelling and subsidies for companies, as part of a process of ""dynamic alignment"". But UK ministers have repeatedly ruled out such a close regulatory relationship. There is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights, with the EU insisting continued access to UK waters must form part of any agreement. Mr Johnson, in turn, has said the UK will act as an ""independent coastal state"" taking control of its own fisheries. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Our approach is clear - we are not asking for anything special, bespoke or unique, but are looking for a deal like those the EU has struck previously with other friendly countries like Canada. ""We want a relationship based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, one centred on free trade and inspired by our shared history and values.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Shakespeare's skull 'probably stolen' from Stratford grave,"The discovery gives credence to a news report in 1879, later dismissed as fiction, that trophy hunters took the skull from his shallow grave in 1794. A team used a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) scan to look through the grave at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford in the first archaeological probe of the site. It allowed investigators to see below ground without disturbing the grave. Archaeologist Kevin Colls of Staffordshire University, who carried out the project with leading geophysicist Erica Utsi, concluded: ""We have Shakespeare's burial with an odd disturbance at the head end and we have a story that suggests that at some point in history someone's come in and taken the skull of Shakespeare. ""It's very, very convincing to me that his skull isn't at Holy Trinity at all."" The investigation was carried out to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. The documentary Secret History: Shakespeare's Tomb will be shown on Channel 4 on Saturday 26 March at 20:00 BST. The playwright's final resting place has long been the subject of argument among historians and archaeologists, because it is too short for an adult burial. It also carries no name, only the chilling curse: ""Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, To dig the dust enclosed here. Blessed be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones."" Key findings of the investigation Investigators went to another church, St Leonard's, in Beoley, Worcestershire, where legend has it a mysterious skull in a sealed crypt is that of Shakespeare's. A forensic anthropological analysis revealed it to belong to an unknown woman who was in her 70s when she died. Mr Colls said: ""It was a great honour to be the first researcher to be given permission to undertake non-invasive archaeological investigations at the grave of William Shakespeare. ""With projects such as this, you never really know what you might find, and of course there are so many contradictory myths and legends about the tomb of the Bard. ""The amazing project team, using state-of-the-art equipment, has produced astonishing results which are much better than I dared hoped for, and these results will undoubtedly spark discussion, scholarly debate and controversial theories for years to come. Even now, thinking of the findings sends shivers down my spine."" The Rev Patrick Taylor, of Holy Trinity, said he was ""not convinced that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that his skull has been taken"". ""We intend to continue to respect the sanctity of his grave, in accordance with Shakespeare's wishes, and not allow it to be disturbed. ""We shall have to live with the mystery of not knowing fully what lies beneath the stone.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Edinburgh trams: Leith Walk may be hit by 18 months of disruption,"The closure of three lanes on Leith Walk would begin when construction on the Â£165.2m project, if approved, gets under way in 2019. A business case details extending the line by 2.8 miles (4.6km) from York Place to Newhaven. A compensation and support scheme would be set up for businesses on the route. Businesses have expressed concerns about the impact of the project. The plan is for services to be running on the line by spring 2022. Segregated cycle lanes It also shows the extension would have segregated cycle lanes. Edinburgh medical student Zhi Min Soh, 23, was killed in May in a collision with a minibus after her wheel became caught in tram tracks on Princes Street. The business case estimates the extended tram line will have a positive economic impact on the city, with every Â£1 spent providing a return of Â£1.64. The council approved in principle the option of completing the existing tram line to Newhaven in December 2015. The report will now be considered at a meeting of the local authority's transport and environment committee on 4 September before going to full council on 21 September. It seeks authority to begin identifying a potential contractor for the project, with a final decision on whether to go ahead to follow in autumn 2018. Adam McVey, City of Edinburgh Council's leader, said: ""Edinburgh is growing faster than any other city in Scotland and our current road network and public transport provision simply aren't sustainable given the number of new residents we're expecting to welcome here over the next two decades. ""Rather than exacerbating traffic problems on our already-congested roads, trams allow far greater numbers of people to travel while creating employment during construction, boosting development along the route and connecting people to centres of employment, leisure and retail."" Public hearings The consideration of the business case will coincide with public hearings in the inquiry into the original Edinburgh trams scheme. The probe, set up in 2014 by the then first minister Alex Salmond and led by Lord Hardie, is examining why the project went significantly over budget and was delivered years later than originally planned. The new business case suggests that a process is put in place to ensure all recommendations from the inquiry are taken into account before contracts for the new construction works are signed. Transport convener, councillor Lesley Macinnes, said: ""Given the experience of the last tram project, we're acutely aware of the need to scrutinise this business case as rigorously as we possibly can - residents deserve nothing less. ""We won't take any decision on completing the line to Newhaven until we are 100% confident that the project can be delivered, financed and managed effectively.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US warned Sri Lanka about Iran - wikileaks,"The revelations published by the Telegraph newspaper in London on Tuesday say the US Embassy in Colombo had expressed its concerns to the Governor of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal and the then Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Dr. Palitha Kohona.

Sri Lankan authorities have asserted that it does not intend to purchase arms from Iran and the trip by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in November 2007 would be focused on trade and investment. ""Both Governor Cabraal and Secretary Kohona replied that Sri Lanka does not intend to purchase arms from Iran,"" reveals the leaked cable message. Oil for Arms According to the secret cable leaked to The Telegraph by Wikileaks, the Ambassador has told Cabraal that the United States urged Sri Lanka ""to be very scrupulous"" in entering into additional trade or investments with Iran. A source that the US embassy describes as 'well-connected and reliable,' had reported to the US authorities, about the government minister responsible for human rights affairs speaking of an oil for arms deal. Minister for Human Rights Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights at that time, Mahinda Samarasinghe was quoted by the source saying, ""Sri Lanka would try to negotiate a contract for $200 million worth of oil from Iran at below-market prices, in exchange for which Sri Lanka would order a significant quantity of arms"". The Embassy source has said that Minister Samarasinghe 'explicitly' noted that the Sri Lankan government hopes the transaction would ""send the U.S. a message."" The Sri Lankan government declined to comment on earlier Wikileaks cables. The US embassy in Colombo stressed in January that cables reflected ""daily analysis and candid assessments,"" and should not be seen as representing US policy.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stone Roses film âhas bandâs blessingâ,"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News, in Cannes The film is part of a slate of projects announced by BBC Films in Cannes. It tells the story of a gang of young teenagers who try to get to the concert without tickets and features extensive use of the band's music. Writer Chris Coghill told the BBC: ""Mani, the bass player and Ian Brown said, 'Whatever we can do to help.'"" He added: ""Essentially, it's my love letter to the Stone Roses and being 16 years old in 1990 in Manchester. There's a little bit of me in all the boys."" The Stone Roses' outdoor concert at Spike Island in Widnes, Cheshire, on 27 May 1990 was attended by around 27,000 people. Although it was badly organised by today's standards and there were complaints about the poor sound quality, it has since become something of a legendary event. ""I never went to Spike Island,"" Coghill admitted. ""I got let down with a ticket the day before, which is what happens to the lads in the film. ""But I just sat on my mum's sofa all day in a mood, whereas these lads go and try to blag their way in."" The film stars Shameless actor Elliott Tittensor, Game of Thrones' Emelia Clarke and actress Lesley Manville. ""It's a coming of age story, all the lads have issues that they're dealing with. It's set over three days and they're all running away from things,"" said Coghill. New songs The trailer, which was shown to journalists in Cannes, is accompanied by several tracks from The Stone Roses' debut album. Former EastEnders actor Coghill said the band jumped at the chance to have their music used in the film. ""I'm mates with Mani and I know Ian a bit, and when we first started talking about it, I emailed them both an outline of what we wanted to do and they said, 'You have our support, you have our blessing, whatever you need.'"" The Stone Roses are due to reform for a world tour this summer, and Coghill said he hoped to have the film ready by November. He also said the band ""have at least three or four new tracks recorded"". Other BBC films unveiled in Cannes include Shadow Dancer, in which Andrea Riseborough plays an IRA informant, and Now Is Good, in which former child actress Dakota Fanning plays a determined teenager living in the shadow of a terminal illness.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
There's now a word for nails on a blackboard - but it's not in English,"By Sarah TijouNewsbeat reporter It's a word to describe the feeling we get when we hear the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard, or a knife scratching a plate. Now psychologists in Spain are suggesting it should be considered its own emotion. Describing what ""grima' means to them, Spanish speakers said it was an ""unpleasant sensation"", ""shivering"", ""sounds"" and ""repulsion"". We're not the only culture who doesn't have this word Some societies don't even have a word for worry, whilst others have 15 words for fear. Prof Vyvyan Evans, who specialises in language and communication, tells Newsbeat this phenomenon relates to something called ""untranslatable words"". ""Emotions can be expressed in a range of ways, and emotions are universal,"" he says. Professor Evans says the reason English-speakers don't have a word for ""grima"" is because ""languages reflect their culture and words help to reinforce culture too"". But this doesn't mean that a particular culture is better or worse at expressing an idea. It's not all about the actual words we speak ""Language is very adaptive,"" says Prof Evans. ""There is a range of ways in which we express emotion. ""In face-to-face spoken interaction, between 60% and 70% of our emotional expression actually comes, not from language, but from non-verbal communication. He says the tone of your voice, or how high or low your pitch is, can also affect how you communicate and express your emotions. ""The face can produce over 10,000 expressions, many of which are associated with emotional experience,"" he adds. So, although we don't have an English word for ""grima"", we can all recognise the horrible faces you make when someone drags their nails down a blackboard. Nine more words for emotions we could use in English Hygge (Danish) - This is the pleasant, intimate feeling associated with sitting around a fire in the winter with close friends. Tartle (Scots) - That panicky hesitation just before you have to introduce someone whose name you can't quite remember. Mamihlapinatapai (Yaghan language of Tierra del Fuego) - That special look shared between two people, when both are wishing that the other would do something that they both want, but neither want to do. Iktsuarpok (Inuit) - That feeling of anticipation when you're waiting for someone to show up at your house and you keep going outside to see if they're there yet. Greng-jai (Thai) - That feeling you get when you don't want someone to do something for you because it would be a pain for them. Gigil (Filipino) - The urge to pinch or squeeze something that is irresistibly cute. Koi No Yokan (Japanese) - The sense upon first meeting a person that the two of you are going to fall in love. Boketto (Japanese) - Gazing vacantly into the distance without thinking. Schadenfreude (German) - Famous for its meaning, this refers to the feeling of pleasure gained by seeing another person's misfortune.

Bowie: Every tour and studio album,"He was a prolific writer, toured extensively and released his last album days before he died. We take a look at the David Bowie's career in numbers - from world tours to numbers of platinum-selling albums. David Bowie's touring history, 1972-2004 David Bowie propelled himself to international superstardom with his epic theatrical Ziggy Stardust tour, which took in the UK, the US and Japan, with approaching 200 shows over 18 gruelling months from January 1972. At the tour's climax in July 1973 at London's Hammersmith Odeon Bowie announced that ""this is the last show we'll ever do"" to the astonishment of devoted fans. While Stardust was no more, Bowie's limitless capacity for genre-hopping and self-reinvention was just beginning, and his appetite for touring in each of his many guises continued unabated - with periodic pauses - until nearly the turn of the millennium. The Heathen tour of 2002 was comparatively modest in scale by Bowie's standards, but still included four transatlantic trips, while the A Reality tour from 2003 to 2004 was his biggest since Ziggy Stardust. It would also prove to be his last. David Bowie in numbers In a career spanning 51 years Â£135m estimated net worth* 140 million albums sold since his first release in 1967 111 singles - averaging more than two a year during his career 51 music videos, along with a number of film roles including The Man Who Fell to Earth and Labyrinth 25 studio albums, including Blackstar, which was released two days before his death Studio albums David Bowie was a prolific writer, producing 25 studio albums (two more if you include albums as part of the band Tin Machine) and dozens of other compilations, live albums, video albums and EPs. His biggest selling album in the UK was his 1972 release The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars, according to the Official Charts UK. Bowie's image appears on every single one of his album covers - except the UK release of The Buddha Of Suburbia and his final album, Blackstar. Blackstar reached number one on 15 January, days after his death.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Wrexham custody conditions criticised, amid praise","A report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons says the custody suite was ""dark and dirty"" and there was inadequate access to toilets for detainees. However, excluding Wrexham, the report said custody facilities in north Wales were ""good overall"". North Wales Police said they welcomed the report. The report says: ""The force had invested in the estate which was generally in good condition with the exception of Wrexham. ""The Wrexham custody suite was a concerning contrast to the good provision we found elsewhere and needed urgent attention. ""Conditions in Wrexham were very poor - the custody suite was dark and dirty; there was limited in-cell sanitation; call bells were taped over (as they were at two other locations); and there were inadequate arrangements to ensure detainees had access to the toilets when required."" The findings were published in a report by Sir Denis O'Connor, chief inspector of constabulary, and Nick Hardwick, chief inspector of prisons. The inspection - part of a wider programme - covered custody suites at Mold, St Asaph, Holyhead, Dolgellau, Caernarfon and Wrexham. 'Some excellent practice' Inspectors found that North Wales Police had a ""good strategic grip on custody"" and there were ""some areas of excellent practice"". The force was praised for ""positive and appropriate interactions between staff and detainees"", as well as ""excellent nursing provision and good clinical care"". However, general criticisms included ""some delays in response times for forensic medical examiners"" and custody staff at times being ""too risk-averse"". The chief inspectors said: ""Overall, North Wales Police provided good custody facilities. ""The financial climate means it will be a challenge to maintain these standards but the strategic approach the force has taken means it is well placed to meet this challenge. ""Conditions in Wrexham were the exception - and required urgent attention."" Assistant chief constable Gareth Pritchard said: ""We recognise the facilities at our busiest suite in Wrexham are not as modern as those in other areas of north Wales. ""As with all the custody suites officers and staff at Wrexham had positive and appropriate interaction with detainees, but the physical condition of the building is in need of improvement. ""Some work has already been done to improve the general cleanliness and overall appearance of the suite, but the style and age of the building makes it difficult to improve further without major capital investment."" He added: ""We are continuing to work on improving how we deal with people in custody.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Met office says 2016 'very likely' to be warmest on record,"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent This year has already been provisionally declared the warmest on record thanks to a combination of global warming and a strong El Nino. The Met Office believes that temperatures in 2016 could be 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. Last week in Paris, countries agreed that the world should pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C. The new forecast, a combination of computer models and statistical methods, says that the global average temperature for the next 12 months is likely to be 0.84C above the 1961-1990 average. When compared to the pre-industrial levels, the forecast predicts that next year's temperature will be 1.1C above the 1850-1899 average. This is edging closer to the 1.5C level that governments agreed last week they would do their best to keep under in the long term. Last year, the forecast for 2015 predicted a central estimate of 0.64 above the average. Observational data from January to October this year shows the global mean temperature so far this year is running at 0.72 above 1961-1990. ""The forecast for next year is on the back of some other strong years,"" said the Met Office's Prof Adam Scaife. ""In 2014 we had 0.6 which was nominally a record, 2015 so far we've had 0.7 which is also nominally a record, and next year we are talking about 0.8 - so you can see that very rapid rise over three years and by the end of 2016 we may be looking at three record years in a row."" 'Unprecedented events' The impact of the strong El Nino that started this year continues through the first half of next year. It's already been responsible for a reduced monsoon season in India, it's also weakened the Atlantic hurricane season and been involved in the early winter storms in Northern Europe in the past few weeks. The forecasters at the Met Office say it is responsible for up to 0.2C of next year's value. In combination with continuing climate change, the forecasters believe it will lead to new records. ""There is an uncertainty range, the bottom end of the range for 2016 is very close to the current value for 2015, so it's not impossible that it will come out the same as 2015 but it is very likely to be higher,"" said Prof Scaife. The Met Office says that the rise in temperature predicted for next year may not continue indefinitely - and may slip back under 1 degree over the coming years. But they argue that the growing warming signal can combine in unpredictable ways with smaller natural fluctuations leading to ""unprecedented events"". ""It's when the natural variability rides on top of the climate change and gives us something we have not seen before,"" said Prof Scaife.

Blood test 'detects cancer relapse',"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found traces of breast cancer eight months before doctors would normally have noticed. In the trial, the test found 12 cancers out of the 15 women who relapsed. Experts said there was still some way to go before there was a test that could be used in hospitals. Surgery to remove a tumour is one of the core treatments for cancer. However, a tumour starts from a single cancerous cell. If parts of the tumour have already spread to another part of the body or the surgeon did not remove it all then the cancer can return. Relapse Fifty-five patients who were at high risk of relapse because of the size of the tumour were followed in the study published in Science Translational Medicine. The scientists analysed the mutated DNA of the tumour and then continued to search the blood for those mutations. Fifteen patients relapsed and the blood test gave advanced warning of 12 of them. The other three patients all had cancers that had spread to the brain where the protective blood-brain barrier could have stopped the fragments of the cancer entering the bloodstream. The test detected cancerous DNA in one patient who has not relapsed. None of the women in the study were told that cancerous material had been detected as it would have been unethical to base decisions on such an unproven prototype. But the hope is that detecting cancer earlier means treatments including chemotherapy can start sooner and improve the odds of survival. Dr Nicholas Turner, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""The key question is are we identifying that these women are at risk of relapse early enough that we could give treatments that could prevent the relapse? ""That is unknown from this research and we hope to address it in future studies. ""[But] we're really talking about a principle that could potentially be applied to any cancer that has gone through initial treatment for which there's a risk of relapse in the future."" More work needed The analysis of the blood is relatively cheap. However, investigating the DNA of the tumour for mutations in the first place is still expensive. The price is coming down as the field of cancer medicine moves from treating tumours in whichever part of the body they are discovered, towards drugs that target specific mutations in tumours. Dr Nick Peel, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Finding less invasive ways of diagnosing and monitoring cancer is really important and blood samples have emerged as one possible way of gathering crucial information about a patient's disease by fishing for fragments of tumour DNA or rogue cancer cells released into their bloodstream. ""But there is some way to go before this could be developed into a test that doctors could use routinely, and doing so is never simple.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Extra Â£40m for green spaces in England, Boris Johnson pledges","By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The government says the cash will fund thousands of jobs in conservation. The prime minister also promised new national parks and greater protections for Englandâs iconic landscapes. Environmentalists welcomed the investment but said it was a fraction of what is needed to restore Britainâs depleted wildlife. Boris Johnson said the scheme was part of his 10-point plan for combating climate change, which Downing Street said would be unveiled this week. The plan has been widely leaked and it is thought to include a commitment to: The natural environment funding will go to environmental charities creating or restoring important habitats like peatland and wetland; preventing or cleaning up pollution; creating woodland; and helping people connect with nature. Mr Johnson said this will in turn create and retain skilled and unskilled jobs, such as ecologists, project managers, tree planters and teams to carry out nature restoration. The projects could give a home to species that flourished in similar initiatives across the country, including the curlew, nightingale, horseshoe bat, pine marten, red squirrel and wild orchids. Mr Johnson said: âBritainâs iconic landscapes are part of the fabric of our national identity - sustaining our communities, driving local economies and inspiring people across the ages. âThatâs why, with the natural world under threat, itâs more important than ever that we act now to enhance our natural environment and protect our precious wildlife and biodiversity.â There are currently 10 national parks in England - including the South Downs, Lake District and Peak District - as well as 34 areas of outstanding national beauty (AONB). The government says the process for designating new national parks and AONB will start next year. And 10 long-term ""landscape recovery"" projects will be initiated between 2022 and 2024 to restore wilder landscapes. 'Enormous task' Craig Bennett, from the Wildlife Trusts, said: ""Of course this is welcome, but itâs a tiny amount compared with whatâs needed. âA previous promise of Â£40m was over-subscribed seven times over. âThe government has pledged to protect 30% of the countryside by 2030, but at the moment only 5% is protected for wildlife. We need Â£1bn every year for this enormous task."" Tony Juniper, head of government agency Natural England, said: ""I warmly welcome this as part of the delivery of the National Nature Recovery Network - and Iâm really pleased to have all this coming from the PM.â The government has slashed funding for his organisation and earlier this week he told MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee that its current funding is below the level required to carry out statutory duties to a good standard. Mr Juniper said taking action to protect species at risk of extinction, ceasing management duties for National Nature Reserves and engaging only a small number of planning authorities to support landscape and biodiversity activities are some of the areas where Natural England has had to scale back support.

Anna Sorokin: Fake heiress released from US prison,"Anna Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy socialite named Anna Delvey, was released from prison on Thursday, according to US media reports. She was found guilty in 2019 of theft of services and grand larceny, having scammed more than $200,000 (Â£145,000) from banks and luxury hotels. It is thought Sorokin could now face deportation. Her release comes months after she reportedly apologised at a parole hearing in October last year. ""I just want to say that I'm really ashamed and I'm really sorry for what I did,"" the New York Post, who obtained a transcript, quoted Sorokin as saying. ""I completely understand that a lot of people suffered when I thought I was not doing anything wrong."" A lawyer for Sorokin previously told Insider that she was trying to appeal against her conviction, despite her planned parole release. 'Fake it until she could make it' During her trial prosecutors told how Sorokin, under the assumed name of Anna Delvey, pretended she was worth about $60m with a trust fund in Europe. Maintaining the scam for several years, Sorokin used her phony persona to facilitate a luxury lifestyle where she lived in a lavish New York hotel and ate out at stylish restaurants. Prosecutors said she used forged financial documents to maintain the charade and even managed to get a $100,000 overdraft loan from one bank. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, argued in court that Sorokin had tried to ""fake it until she could make it"" and had been ""easily seduced by glamour and glitz"" of life in New York. Headlines about her trial often focused on her fashion choices after she employed a courtroom stylist and one day refused to appear in front of the judge because of her outfit. Ultimately Sorokin was found guilty of eight counts and acquitted of two others. 'Inventing Anna' Her story came to international attention in 2018 after a hit New York Magazine feature by writer Jessica Pressler. That story is now being turned into a Netflix series produced by Shonda Rhimes, behind hit TV shows Grey's Anatomy and Scandal. Last month Insider reported that Sorokin had used most of the $320,000 fee she was paid for the show to pay restitution to banks and other fines. Another project about Sorokin's con, based on a book by a former friend, was previously announced by HBO.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Top universities in Russell Group fees review protest,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent They are angry that the Russell Group, which represents their universities, is refusing to publish evidence it submitted to the official fees review. Students are to deliver a protest letter on Monday to the offices of the Russell Group. The Russell Group says it does not want documents to be seen ""out of context"". The students want the Russell Group to publish its evidence given to the review and to give a date for the publication of its report on fees. 'Confidential' ""It is completely unacceptable that a document from our universities that so directly impacts on our students is being kept hidden,"" says Emmanuel Akpan-Inwang from the students' union at the London School of Economics. The Russell Group rejects any claim of secrecy, saying that the submission to the fees review was always intended as part of a wider report on student funding - and that this will be published in the next few weeks. Mr Akpan-Inwang is chair of the Aldwych Group - which represents students at Russell Group universities. They are angry that the Russell Group has asked the cross-party review of fees to keep its submission confidential. This review, chaired by Lord Browne, is considering whether fees and interest rates for student loans should be increased. Students want the views of the influential Russell Group to be made public, alongside the views of other university groups which have been published. Attempts by students from Oxford University to use freedom of information requests to force the publication of the Russell Group's submission were rejected by the government. The students accuse university leaders of trying to ""stifle debate"". ""As student representatives, we find it disingenuous and underhand that the UK's elite universities have refused several freedom of information requests asking for its submissions to be published,"" says Mr Akpan-Inwang. ""The outcome of the Browne Review may represent the most significant change to higher education funding in decades, and students deserve to know what is being said by an organisation representing our universities. ""It is completely unacceptable that it has been withheld until after the election and clear that the Russell Group are attempting to stifle debate."" The Russell Group has rejected suggestions that there is anything being concealed from students. The group says that it did not want to publish the submission to the fees review out of context - when it forms part of a wider report. ""We submitted our early findings for this report to the Browne Review in time for their first deadline and asked the review team to treat our advice as confidential, pending the publication of our final report.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Car immobiliser easy to crack, say researchers","They found the encryption system used in many car immobilisers can be cracked, potentially letting a thief steal the car. Vehicles made by 26 separate car firms including Volkswagen, Porsche and Honda use the ""weak"" security system. The researchers first released their findings two years ago but legal action prevented publication. Security hacks Security researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio Garcia, and Baris Ege from Radboud University in The Netherlands investigated the encryption system used by the Megamos immobiliser. This stops a car engine being started if the correct radio chip in a key fob is not close by. These systems can be fooled with boosters that amplify the signal on the corresponding chip but the researchers took a different approach that tackled the data passing between car keys and the Megamos system. Eavesdropping on the exchange of data between the car key and crypto system a couple of times gave the trio useful hints about which secret key was being used to scramble the data. This helped them find which cryptographic key was being used in about 30 minutes. Some car makers were using very weak secret keys that could be found in just a few minutes using a laptop. In a paper describing their work, the three researchers said it was ""trivial"" to accomplish the attack on the immobiliser system. The research was completed three years ago but legal action by Volkswagen and French defence group Thales initially prevented publication. The restrictions on publication have now been lifted after the paper was edited. The BBC has contacted Megamos for a comment but the company has not yet responded. Fixing the flaws in the cryptographic system overseeing the data exchange will be hard as it involves replacing radio chips in car key fobs and the corresponding hardware in affected vehicles. The team said it had been talking to car makers about its findings, and measures had been taken to prevent some of the attacks working. The paper comes after several other security researchers revealed ways to take over in-car computer systems. Some researchers have attacked the Tesla Model S while others found a way to send a text message that can disable cars using a specific onboard modem. In one of the most dramatic hacks, hackers from security firm IOActive stopped a Chrysler Jeep from many miles away via its infotainment system.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cocaine smuggling: The bizarre tactics used to hide drugs,"But sneaking drugs under the noses of authorities can be a risky business, as a Colombian cocaine smuggler discovered this week. The man was caught at Barcelona's Josep Tarradellas Airport with 0.5kg (1.1lb) of cocaine, estimated to be worth around â¬30,000 (Â£27,000), police said. Officers did not have to look hard for the package, which was nestled under his ill-fitting toupee. Suspected drug traffickers in Brazil didn't have much luck this week either. Unwitting customers bought soap boxes containing cocaine at a supermarket in Sao Paulo. Those customers tipped off police, who later seized an estimated 80kg (176lb) of the drug from the shop. Detectives believe soap powder boxes stuffed with the drug were put on the shelves by mistake. There have been many other brazen drug smuggling tactics down the years which have also failed to fool the authorities. Smarty pants A Brazilian man made an outlandish bid to smuggle drugs into Portugal in 2018 and was arrested at Lisbon's international airport, accused of carrying 1kg (2.2lb) of cocaine inside a pair of fake buttocks. The two cushion-like implants, which were attached to swimming trunks, contained at least 5,000 individual portions of cocaine. Cocaine pineapple ring The Iberian Peninsula is a major entry point for cocaine to Europe. But drug smuggling operations are regularly disrupted. In 2018, police in Portugal and Spain seized 745kg (1,642lb) of cocaine hidden inside fresh pineapples. The drugs had been transported from South America. Sister act Given their pious commitment to religion, nuns are not typically associated with drugs smuggling. Hence, in 2013, three women from Colombia attempted to take advantage of nuns' squeaky-clean reputation. The women, who were disguised as nuns, were arrested with 2kg (4.4lb) of cocaine each strapped to their bodies at a Colombian airport. The fake nuns were searched after police saw them acting suspiciously. Suspicious cargo In 2018, a large container ship carrying meat from Brazil was due to dock in Algeria's western port of Oran. For three days the ship's captain refused to make port, arousing the suspicion of Algerian authorities. Acting on a tip-off, the Algerian coastguard forced the boat - the Liberian-registered Vega Mercury - into port. On board, authorities found more than 700kg (1,543lb) of cocaine in boxes marked ""halal meat"". The art of the drug deal In 2010, Colombian police found 16kg (35lb) of cocaine inside replicas of three sculptures by artist Fernando Botero. The cocaine, which was being shipped to Spain, had been mixed into the clay of the sculptures as they were being cast, police said. A police statement described the smuggling attempt as a ""sophisticated concealment system"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Singer Ruth Keggin 'breathes life' into ancient language,"By Mark EdwardsBBC Isle of Man Ruth Keggin's debut solo album features new arrangements of traditional and contemporary folk songs, most of which are sung in the Gaelic language. The 25-year-old said: ""Manx never died out - the language revival started decades ago."" There are currently around 1,700 Manx speakers on the Isle of Man. In 2009, United Nations cultural body Unesco was forced to change its classification of the language from ""extinct"" following protests from islanders. Several letters were sent from children at the island's Bunscoill (Manx language school) in St Johns, which has taught all lessons in the Isle of Man's native tongue since 2001. The children wrote: ""If our language is extinct then what language are we writing in?"" 'Vibrant and alive' Bunscoill head teacher Julie Matthews said: ""The Isle of Man language is having something of a renaissance."" Currently 71 children attend the school. The language itself has similarities with the Gaelic tongues spoken in the island's neighbours, Ireland and Scotland. Mrs Matthews said: ""It is going from strength to strength and having young and exciting musicians like Ruth can only help to inspire future generations. ""We want to make Manx relevant in the future, not something we are simply preserving from the past. ""A great deal has been done over the past 30 years to resurrect the language and Ruth's music is certainly going to help keep it vibrant and alive."" 'Manx never died' The singer began work on the album, funded by Culture Vannin, in November 2012. She said: ""There is such an international interest in the language these days - I'm happy to be a small part of that and share these songs with people around the world."" ""I'm hoping the music goes down well and people like the songs. Generally, I think there is a very positive attitude towards Manx music,"" she added. Culture Vannin's Manx language officer Adrian Caine said: ""This is a modern interpretation by an extremely talented singer which can do nothing but good for the language. ""She is breathing new life into the language with her music,"" he said. The Port Erin singer will launch her album by singing tracks at the Centenary Centre in Peel on Saturday. BBC Radio 3 broadcaster Mary Ann Kennedy recently described her as ""the pure and passionate Gaelic voice of the Manx music renaissance"". The Scottish musician said: ""Ruth is a real talent and her music will unquestionably help what is a fragile language. It is very special. ""I have been following the Manx music scene for a number of years and there is a new generation taking it forwards. ""The music is being played but until now the language was not necessarily attached. This could be a real breakthrough.""

Chinese doctors jailed for illegal organ harvesting,"The group had tricked the families of the deceased into thinking they were making official organ donations. Between 2017 and 2018 they removed the livers and kidneys from 11 people at a hospital in Anhui province. China is grappling with a huge shortage of organs and has struggled to meet demand through public donations. According to local reports, the trafficking ring included four high-ranking doctors, some of whom worked in organ procurement in hospitals. Local media said they would target car crash victims or patients who suffered from cerebral haemorrhage at the Huaiyuan County People's Hospital in Anhui. The hospital's head of the intensive care unit, Yang Suxun, would approach a patient's family members and ask if they would consent to donating their loved one's organs. The family members would sign what would later turn out to be fake consent forms. The person would then be wheeled out of the hospital in the middle of the night, and put into a van made to look like an ambulance where doctors would remove the organs. The organs would then be sold to individuals or other hospitals which members of the trafficking ring contacted secretly, according to reports. They were eventually found out when the son of one of the victims grew suspicious. Several months after his mother's death in 2018, Shi Xianglin rechecked the documents his family received when they agreed to her organ donation, and found several discrepancies - including blank sections in the forms. He then discovered there were no records of his mother's donation held either with provincial authorities or the China Organ Donation Administrative Centre in Beijing. He told local news outlet Dazhongwang that when he asked Yang about this, he was immediately offered a large sum of money to ""keep mum"". You may also be interested in... ""That's when I was sure that something very strange was going on,"" Mr Shi said. He promptly alerted the authorities. The six men in the organ trafficking ring were sentenced in July for the crime of ""deliberately destroying corpses"". They received jail terms of between 10 and 28 months. The case only appears to have come to light now after Mr Shi spoke to local media. For years China harvested the organs of executed prisoners to help meet demand, a practice that came under widespread global criticism. It was officially stopped in 2015 but authorities at the time said it would be tough to ensure compliance. The country now relies on public donations to its national organ bank. Donor rates in China have increased in recent years but are still much lower than in other parts of the world - 4.4 donations per million people, compared with 49 per million in Spain. In 2015 the BBC reported on the thriving black market trade in organs where traffickers arranged sales online.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Times and Sunday Times readership falls after paywall,"Times Online was registering about 21 million unique users a month to its front page earlier this year but the figure fell to 2.7 million last month. The papers said in addition 100,000 people had a joint subscription to read the newspapers in print and digitally. Times editor James Harding said the papers were ""hugely encouraged"". Publishers of the Times and Sunday Times have revealed for the first time how many people are paying to read their newspapers online or on mobiles. They said that figures stood at 105,000. The subscription figures have been eagerly awaited by publishers and advertisers since the two papers went behind an online paywall four months ago. The figure for unique users for their websites comprises two million for the Times and 700,000 for the Sunday Times. BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said many people in the industry had been sceptical about the paywall move, and that there would be intense analysis and debate over the significance of the figures. 'Suicidal economics' Times executives said they had expected to lose 90% of the papers' online readers when they started charging Â£2 a week, or Â£9.99 for a four-week iPad subscription. Mr Harding told the BBC: ""It's very early days but we're hugely encouraged by what we've seen. ""We're seeing that those people who are reading the digital editions of the Times and the Sunday Times really like them, if they sign up for a trial they tend to stick with us. ""We'd engaged in a quite suicidal form of economics - which was giving our journalism away for free. We knew that if we continued to do that we couldn't invest in reporting. ""Our concern was would we be cut off from the 'internet conversation', and the truth is we haven't been."" 'Very pleased' The publishers now say the total paid audience so far is close to 200,000, allowing for duplications in subscriptions. About 50,000 are paying a monthly subscription, either for the website editions or to read the papers on an iPad or Kindle. Many others are buying a Â£1 day pass. The figures include subscribers to the print version of the papers who receive an online subscription as a result. Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News International, said: ""We are very pleased by the response to our new digital services. ""These figures very clearly show that large numbers of people are willing to pay for quality journalism in digital formats.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mexico: We will not pay for Trump border wall,"Enrique Pena Nieto said he ""lamented"" the plans for the barrier, but made no mention of changing a scheduled trip to Washington to meet the US president. Mr Trump responded saying ""it would be better to cancel"" the 31 January meeting if Mexico is unwilling to pay. He has signed an executive order for an ""impassable physical barrier"" and insisted Mexico will reimburse the US. Read more In a televised address, Mr Pena Nieto told the nation : ""I've said time and again; Mexico won't pay for any wall. ""I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us."" He added that ""Mexico doesn't believe in walls"". But Mr Pena Nieto said his country offered ""its friendship to the American people and its willingness to reach accords with their government"". President Trump took to Twitter following his statement, suggesting Mexico owed the US for the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). ""The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers of jobs and companies lost,"" he wrote. ""If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting."" Earlier Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray - in Washington to lead a delegation that has held talks at the White House - told the Televisa network Mexico's president was still weighing next Tuesday's visit but said ""the meeting stands for now"". Mr Pena Nieto met Mr Trump - then a presidential candidate - in Mexico City in September and came under intense criticism at home and his current approval ratings are low. Mr Trump said in an interview with ABC News that Mexico would ""absolutely, 100%"" reimburse the US for his wall. But Congress would have to approve funding for the structure, which is estimated to cost billions of dollars. Building a 2,000 mile (3,200km) barrier along the Mexican border was one of Mr Trump's key pledges in the election campaign. He spoke of a ""crisis"" on the southern US border as he signed the directives during a ceremony at the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. The orders also called for hiring 10,000 immigration officials to help boost border patrol efforts. ""A nation without borders is not a nation,"" he said. ""Beginning today the United States gets back control of its borders."" The executive orders are among a flurry expected on national and border security this week. Elon Musk: I'm Trump's voice of reason Mr Trump is next expected to announce immigration restrictions from seven countries with Muslim-majority populations in the Middle East and Africa.

Tiananmen crash: China police 'detain suspects',"Police have described the incident as a ""violent terror attack"", the Xinhua news agency says, for first time. All three people in the car had names from the Muslim Uighur minority in the restive western region of Xinjiang. Two bystanders died and 38 people were injured after the vehicle crashed into a crowd and burst into flames. The police said that what happened at Tiananmen Square was a ""violent terrorist attack"" which was ""carefully planned and organised"", Xinhua says. The jeep that crashed into a bridge in front of the Forbidden City was driven by a man who was with his wife and mother, police said in a statement. The three ignited petrol inside the car, they added. Police said the vehicle they found on Monday had a container for petrol, two knives and what they describe as a flag with extremist religious slogans on it. They added that the car's number plates were registered in Xinjiang province. They said they also found more knives and another flag at a location in Beijing. On Wednesday, a number of news agency reports said a police notice was being circulated among hotels in Beijing, asking information about eight suspects. Seven have names typical of the Uighur ethnic group and the other, although seemingly from China's majority Han ethnicity, has an address in Xinjiang, reports say. A tourist from the Philippines and a tourist from Guangdong province were among those killed in the incident. Another 38 people were injured, including three tourists from the Philippines and one from Japan. Uighur complaints Police shut down the scene of the incident - at the north end of the square at an entrance to the Forbidden City - shortly after it occurred, temporarily closing a subway station and a road. A BBC crew attempting to record footage at the location were briefly detained, while on Chinese social media some pictures of the scene appeared to be quickly deleted and comments were heavily censored. Xinjiang is home to the minority Muslim Uighur group, some of whom complain of cultural and religious repression under Beijing's rule. There have been sporadic outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang, including in both Pishan and Shanshan counties. China says it grants the Uighurs wide-ranging freedoms. In June, riots in Xingjian's Turpan prefecture, which is in Shanshan county, killed 27 people. State media said police opened fire after a mob armed with knives attacked police stations and a local government building. In April another incident in the city of Kashgar left 21 people dead. The government said the violence was linked to terrorist activity, but local people told the BBC it involved a local family who had a longstanding dispute with officials over religious freedom.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
National Videogame Arcade opens in Nottingham,"The Â£2.5m National Videogame Arcade (NVA), in Nottingham, celebrates the industry through interactive exhibits and vintage arcade machines. The NVA follows the success of Game City, an annual videogame festival held in Nottingham since 2006. Games entrepreneur Ian Livingstone said it was about time the country had a centre devoted to videogames. He said: ""We only have to see the evidence all around us, on public transport you see people playing games on smartphone devices, in the home, everywhere we go, it's pervasive. ""The games industry is worth $100bn alone. ""It's not just guys making games for guys, there's cultural and diverse content and also diversity in creation, which is more important."" Analysis: Neil Heath, BBC News Online It is apparent when you visit the centre how, whether you like it or not, videogames are a huge part of our lives. The question is why has it taken so long for a national centre to be set up? For me memories came flooding back of afternoons spent in seaside arcades by the appearance of vintage arcade games like Track and Field and Donkey Kong. The staff at the National Videogame Arcade are passionate about the industry and are on a quest to show that it is just as important to the UK as art, film and theatre. The centre lies in the heart of Nottingham's creative quarter, in Hockley. It has five floors and boasts vintage arcade machines, interactive exhibits, a cinema, cafe and an education space. Jonathan Smith, one of the centre's directors, said the building would be a ""cathedral"" for the art form and a unique visitor attraction. The industry has often come under fire for the content of a number of 18 certificated titles including Grand Theft Auto. However, Mr Smith said criticism of gaming was unfair and he hoped the NVA would help change people's minds. ""Videogames are fantastic learning tools for children, they encourage creativity, experimentation and social play with others,"" he said. ""They are part of a healthy diet of different learning techniques and of different activities which of course includes going outside, running around and making things with your hands, but within that rich landscape I think [videogames] play a really important role."" The NVA is set to open on Saturday morning. Why Nottingham? It was a question asked by national media during the press day at the NVA and several reasons were given. Ian Livingstone, who co-founded Games Workshop, which is based in Nottingham, said games had a ""long legacy"" in the city. ""Games and Nottingham sit hand and hand,"" he said. However, the NVA has not emerged out of nothing. Game City, a festival celebrating videogames as cultural works, began in 2006 in partnership with Nottingham Trent University. The event is still going strong after nine years and has always been backed by Nottingham City Council.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
MEPs vote for universal charger for smartphones,"The resolution passed with 582 votes in favour to 40 against. MEPs will now urge the European Commission (EC) to adopt the new rules. The MEPs want to make it possible for consumers to use a single charger for all smartphone and tablet models. But the devices themselves could still, in theory, use different ports. The idea behind the move is to ""decouple"" the sale of a charger from that of a new mobile device, and instead encourage consumers to re-use those they already own. From A to C At present, Apple packages most of its iPhones with charging plugs that have a USB-A port for their Lightning cables. By contrast, some Android phones - such as Google's Pixel 4 - come with a wall charger that features a smaller USB-C port, for use with a corresponding USB-C cable. Apple does sell a cable that has a USB-C connector at one end and a Lightning one at the other, so in theory could easily switch its adapters to the new technology. In fact, its top-end smartphone - the iPhone 11 Pro Max - comes bundled with a USB-C power adapter. The move would, however, mean that most existing Lightning cables - and indeed other types of cable with USB-A connections - would require an adapter to work with the new chargers. It could also prevent companies having the freedom to move to a follow-up type of port in the future when the next standard emerges. European politicians have been campaigning for a common standard for the past decade, with the EC estimating that obsolete cables generate more than 51,000 tonnes of waste per year. They acknowledged, however, that the situation is at least better than in the past, when some proprietary charging cables came hard-wired to their plug, meaning the adapter had no use beyond the device it came with. ""In 2009, there were more than 30 charging solutions, while today there are three charger types,"" a press release from the European Parliament said. But Apple has previously said: ""We want to ensure that any new legislation will not result in the shipment of any unnecessary cables or external adaptors with every device, or render obsolete the devices and accessories used by many millions of Europeans and hundreds of millions of Apple customers worldwide."" Ben Wood, an analyst with research firm CCS Insight, said: ""Given the current trend towards sustainability and a reduction in e-waste, this seems like a sensible move. However, the EU needs to be careful not to stifle innovation by mandating a certain technology indefinitely."" With an eye to the future, MEPs have also said they want the EC to ensure that different wireless chargers are interoperable with different mobile devices. Correction 1 February: This article has been amended to clarify that the vote was about creating a common charger and not a common cable.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Oil prices slump on Saudi comments,"The comments by deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman are seen as a challenge to Iran. It has vowed to increase oil production following the lifting of Western sanctions. In the Bloomberg interview, the prince also spoke about his plan for a giant public investment fund. Worth more than $2 trillion, it would be designed to reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on income from oil. Part of the plan would be a sale of shares in the state-owned oil firm Aramco, which could start as soon as next year, according to the interview. Production freeze Iran will not take part in a conference in Doha on 17 April, where the freezing of oil output is due to be discussed. ""If all countries agree to freeze production, we will be among them,"" the prince told Bloomberg. When asked whether Iran needed to be among those countries he said ""without doubt"". Oil prices, which had edged into positive territory, fell after the Prince's comments. Brent crude fell $1.63 cents, or 4%, to $38.70 a barrel. Prices rose 6% in the first three months of this year - the first quarterly increase since a 15% rally between April and June 2015. Hopes dashed PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said there had been high hopes about the impact of a possible production freeze, but he added: ""It is hard to see how sticking to the January output level would be supportive for oil prices. There will be no rebalancing this year."" Shailaja Nair, of energy information provider, said the market was still oversupplied with crude and there was no possibility of demand increasing in the short term. ""Considering the amount of crude already in the market, a freeze is not going to make much of a difference,"" she said. A monthly survey by Reuters this week showed that oil output from the 13 Opec members rose in March on higher production from Iran and near-record exports from southern Iraq. Iraq reported Opec's biggest supply growth last year, producing more than four million barrels per day - making it the cartel's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia. In February, Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would freeze oil output at January levels if other producers followed suit. Oil prices have plunged from their recent peak of $116 in June 2014 because of oversupply and sluggish demand.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
HMRC claims victory in film tax battle,"The Ingenious scheme tried to use artificial losses arising from backing a range of films, said HMRC. They included Avatar, Life of Pi and Die Hard 4. The Icebreaker scheme attempted to create artificial losses from limited liability partnerships. Ingenious called the Tax Tribunal decision ""arbitrary and subjective"". ""In our opinion, the assumptions on which this conclusion is based reflect an arbitrary and subjective view of future film performance at the moment of greenlighting, and are unreasonable,"" it said in a letter to investors. The company said it was ""pleased"" that the tribunal had recognised the schemes as ""bona fide businesses run for profit"". HMRC said both schemes saw users claim more in tax relief than they had invested, something disputed by Ingenious. It is thought Ingenious will appeal against the decision, contained in a judgement running for more than 300 pages. The Ingenious scheme members claimed to have financed 100% of the cost of producing films or games. The bulk of the cost was written off in year one, giving the partners large losses which were set against other income. But only 30% of the expenditure was actually funded from the partners' cash, the other 70% was routed through the partnership on paper only. Ingenious said it remained a major investor in film and television, both in the UK and internationally, and said it had recently backed successes such as Brooklyn, Carol and Suffragette. The Icebreaker scheme members claimed tax relief on losses many times higher than the actual amount they invested in the partnerships. The return on the partners' ""investment"" was the tax relief, which was considerably larger than their cash contribution. 'Big bills' Users of the Ingenious scheme were given the opportunity to settle on similar terms nearly four years ago, said HMRC. They now face big bills for interest on top of the Â£43m in unpaid tax resulting from the scheme. The HMRC's decision follows an earlier case in 2014. The total tax at stake then was Â£134m, taking HMRC's total in reclaimed monies to more than Â£1.2bn. Jennie Granger, Director General of Enforcement & Compliance, HMRC, said: ""These were some of the biggest films of all time, and the schemes involved people claiming far more in tax than they invested in the first place. ""We always say that if something is too good to be true then it probably is. And in this case, the long legal battle will mean that investors face even bigger bills."" However, Neil Forster, Ingenious CEO, said: ""HMRC appears to be deliberately confusing the Ingenious case with other proven tax avoidance schemes and making assertions which are factually wrong. The Ingenious investors received no more tax relief than the cash they invested.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims,"Colonia Dignidad was founded by former Nazi soldier Paul SchÃ¤fer in 1961. The commune, which was located 350km (220 miles) south of Santiago, was run as a secretive cult and dozens of children were sexually abused there. Hundreds of German and Chilean survivors will now be eligible for compensation. The decision to pay the victims was made by a government commission in Berlin on Friday. A fund of â¬3.5m will be set aside to do so. It comes a week after prosecutors dropped their investigation into a German doctor who worked at the commune. A court in Chile had found Hartmut Hopp guilty of complicity in child sex abuse committed by SchÃ¤fer, but he fled to Germany before he could be jailed. German prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to uphold the ruling. What was Colonia Dignidad? Colonia Dignidad was a colony set up by SchÃ¤fer in the remote Maule area. He ran it as a secretive cult with members living as virtual slaves and prevented from leaving by armed guards with dogs. At its peak, 300 Germans and Chileans were living in the 137 sq km (53 sq mile) compound surrounded by wire fencing and overlooked by a watchtower with searchlights. Children were forced to live separately from their parents and dozens were sexually abused by SchÃ¤fer. What else happened there? It was not just members of SchÃ¤fer's sect who suffered abuse. Under the military rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet, Colonia Dignidad became a clandestine detention centre. About 300 opponents of the regime were interrogated and tortured in its underground tunnels both by members of the Chilean secret police and SchÃ¤fer's associates. At least 100 people are thought to have been murdered there. One of those believed to have been killed at the site is US academic Boris Weisfeiler, who went hiking in Chile in 1984. In its report, released on Friday, the German commission said SchÃ¤fer ""tore families apart, abused countless children and actively collaborated with Pinochet dictatorship henchmen on torture, murder and disappearances. ""The survivors still suffer massively from the severe psychological and physical consequences after years of harm caused by violence, abuse, exploitation and slave labour,"" the report read. The compensation would be paid ""exclusively out of moral responsibility and without recognition of a legal obligation,"" it added. SchÃ¤fer fled Chile in 1997 while facing a number of lawsuits over the sexual abuse of children. He was arrested in Argentina in 2005 and convicted of serial paedophilia. He died in prison aged 88 in 2010. Colonia Dignidad changed its name to Villa Baviera in 1991 and has become a tourist resort with a German-themed restaurant and hotel. More than 100 people, many of them former members of the commune, live at the site with many saying it is the only home they have ever known.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hungary government proposes same-sex adoption ban,"The proposed amendment would specify that ""the mother is a woman, the father is a man"" and permit only married couples to adopt children. Same-sex marriage is illegal in Hungary, but adoption has been possible if one partner applies on their own. The draft legislation has been condemned by human rights groups. The proposal was sent to parliament by the governing right-wing Fidesz party late on Tuesday. It would require children to be raised with a ""Christian"" interpretation of gender roles. ""[It] ensures education in accordance with the values based on Hungary's constitutional identity and Christian culture,"" it reads. Hungary's government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has made sweeping changes to the constitution since coming to power in 2010. The document already defines ""the institution of marriage as between a man and a woman"" as well as ""the basis of the family and national survival"". Under the latest proposed amendment, single people could only adopt with special permission from the minister in charge of family affairs. For this reason, the proposal is also being viewed by critics as an attack on single-parent families as well as LGBT people. Government pushes its definition of family These proposals are the latest move by the Fidesz government to reinforce its definition of a family as a union of husband and wife and their children. It reasons that the traditional family is under attack worldwide from ultra-liberal ideologists, and must be defended. The amendments are likely to be voted into force by the two-thirds Fidesz majority in early December. Meanwhile, the Equal Treatment Authority, which has criticised and even fined government ministers in the past, will be abolished. The immediate effect of this change in the constitution will be to make it almost impossible for any individuals, including a small number living in a same-sex relationship, to adopt children. At least 500,000 children in Hungary live in single-parent families, and opposition parties have accused the government of discriminating against them in the family allowance and tax system. LGBTQ groups said it was deliberately drafted at a time when mass protests were not possible due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""The timing is no coincidence,"" a statement from the HÃ¡ttÃ©r Society rights group said. It added: ""The proposals that severely limit legal rights and go against basic international and European human rights ... were submitted at a time when... protests are not allowed."" In May, Hungary's parliament approved a law that banned transgender people from changing the sex they were assigned at birth on official documents. At the time, rights groups said it would worsen discrimination against LGBTQ citizens. ""People are in panic, people want to escape from Hungary to somewhere else where they can get their gender recognised,"" said Tina Korlos Orban, vice president of the advocacy group Transvanilla Transgender Association.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
A83 Rest and Be Thankful reopens after landslip,"Workers have been clearing 1,000 tonnes of debris from the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83 after a series of landslips. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has been trying to deal with concerns from local politicians and businesses that the local economy is suffering. Landslips have closed the Rest and Be Thankful five times in five years. A long diversion - running via the A83, A819, A85 and A82 and adding up to 50 miles to some journeys - was put in place following the landslide earlier in the week. The closed section of road has been reopened using a single lane, controlled by traffic lights. The Scottish government's infrastructure secretary, Alex Neil, who met Argyll business leaders and politicians, said progress with solving the landslide problem would be monitored by a new task force. He said: ""Having met and spoken to local business owners, community representatives and councillors today, I fully appreciate their frustration at the ongoing disruption to the local economy, especially at such an important time of the tourist season. ""We have already allocated significant funding to tackle the problem and, weather permitting, and if we can finalise a deal with private landowners, work will get underway on the emergency route in the coming weeks.

Flooding and storm warnings across England,"The Environment Agency has issued flood alerts in 50 areas - 42 of which are in south-east England. Six flood warnings are in place; five for the South East, including parts of the River Mole on the Surrey/Sussex border, and one in the Anglia region. The Met Office is warning of heavy rain in London and south and east England. BBC Weather said rain would affect many southern, central and south-eastern parts of England overnight and become persistent and very heavy in places, particularly in the South East. It said further outbreaks of rain would affect parts of Scotland. There are no severe flood warnings - the highest alert - which means there is an immediate danger to life. Four people were rescued from their cars in two separate flood-related incidents in one Hampshire village. At 14:24 BST, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service were called to Portchester Lane in Southwick where a car had become partially submerged. Two people were taken to safety. Then, at 15:45 BST, crews returned to nearby Boarhunt Road where they assisted two more people to safety from their car. A man also had to be rescued by firefighters after his car became stuck in a flood in Waterlooville, Hampshire. Mick Crennell, from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""This incident highlights the dangers of attempting to drive through deep water and it gives an indication of how quickly the situation can change and become life-threatening."" The latest warnings follow a weekend of heavy rain and flooding, mainly focused on Wales. In West Sussex, about 40 properties as well as the basement of Worthing Hospital were flooded. Most of the water had been pumped out of the basement by Monday morning but emergencies had to be diverted to Brighton and Chichester for several hours.

New e-petitions website opens,"The petition.parliament.uk site is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a ""new dialogue"" with MPs and ministers. E-petitions will initially be considered by a cross-party committee of MPs chaired by Labour's Helen Jones. The first e-petition tabled called for increased taxes on foreigners buying UK property worth more than Â£3.5m. Under the previous system, petitions were directed to government departments rather than MPs, with 10,000 signatures required for an official response and 100,000 needed for a petition to be considered for a debate in Parliament. More than 40 petitions passed the 100,000 signature threshold during the last Parliament. A number of them were subsequently debated in Parliament although critics say not enough of them were given parliamentary airtime. The thresholds for a petition getting a response or being considered for a debate have not changed in the revamp of the old website which launched in 2011. The new site will be jointly run by the House of Commons and the government. The Petitions Committee, made up of 11 MPs from different parties, said it would enable every British citizen and UK resident to start or a sign a petition electronically. 'Exciting step' The committee, whose creation was recommended in a report by MPs last December, said its role was to liaise with petitioners, seek information from government about issues raised and, in some cases, refer petitions to specialist parliamentary committees. ""First and foremost, it is an easy way for people to let MPs and ministers know they care about,"" Ms Jones said. ""What's more, it gives us a chance to open up a new dialogue between the public and Parliament. I very much hope that the petitions committee will be able to bring forward issues that wouldn't otherwise have been debated or investigated in Parliament. ""For the most pressing petitions, we will be able to schedule debates...It is an exciting step for Parliament and a visible demonstration of its commitment to improving public engagement with what goes on here.""

Jermaine told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""Michael was tried by a jury of his peers and he was acquitted."" He added: ""There was no real evidence, there was nothing there and I will say this - our family are tired."" The four-hour documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last week and was seen to be so shocking that audiences were offered emotional support in the interval. Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families. Mr Robson said under oath in 2005 that the pop star never abused him, but has now rowed back on this. Jackson's estate has previously condemned the film, saying it is ""an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in"" on the singer, who died in 2009 at the age of 50. The film's director Dan Reed defended the documentary, saying he believed what the men were alleging in the film. ""Neither Wade, James or any members of their families were paid for their participation in the film, directly or indirectly,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""This is not a story about Michael Jackson. It's a story about child sexual abuse that happened to two families whose lives intersected with Jackson. The fact that the abuser is Michael Jackson gives the film a reach and a relevance that I welcome."" 'Let this man rest' Jermaine Jackson maintained Michael's innocence during his interview on Wednesday. ""There were slumber parties, there were girls there with their parents watching movies and eating cookies... ""Let this man rest. He did a lot for the world, let him rest. I'll just say this, there is no truth to this documentary... ""We're living in a time where people can say anything and it's taken as truth. ""Under oath he [Mr Robson] said what he said, they would rather believe a documentary than looking at what was said under oath, under a judge, jury, everything.""

Robot used to guide surgeons through knee operations,"By Eleanor BradfordBBC Scotland Health Correspondent The technique is being tested at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where 150 patients are involved in trials. It is part of a collaboration between surgeons, bio-engineers and a US health care company and could result in more effective knee replacements. Each robot costs Â£750,000, but the procedure could also cut recovery times to a matter of days, saving costs. One of the first patients to undergo the procedure using the robot was 70-year-old arthritis sufferer May Walker, who had the same operation on her other leg 11 years ago. She said: ""The last time, when I recovered, I had blood transfusions and pain. ""This time I can't feel pain at the moment. My knees are still numb with the anaesthetic but it's absolutely amazing how I'm feeling."" Precision tool Mrs Walker expects to stay in hospital for just three days compared to eight days the last time. Eventually recovery time is expected to come down to just 23 hours. The robot guides the surgeon's hand, showing where he needs to cut bone away and gently resisting him if he tries to cut the wrong area. Professor Philip Rowe, from Strathclyde University's bioengineering department, said: ""When it came down to surgery we were still relying on saws and carpentry. ""The robot brings the accuracy and precision of an industrial tool."" Images of the patient's knee are loaded into software which controls the robot's movements. Sensors are placed on the patient's knee to tell the robot its exact position. A picture on a screen tells the surgeon which area of bone needs to be removed - with an accuracy of within a millimetre. Business development manager Benny Hagag, from manufacturers Mako Surgical, said it would enhance the skills of the doctors. ""It's not replacing a surgeon, it's actually working with the surgeon, and letting the surgeon do a better job every day,"" he said. Surgeon Mark Blyth agreed: ""One of the problems with traditional techniques is that we rely on visual guides to ensure the accuracy of our surgery. ""That generally means making bigger incisions because if you can't see what you're doing you can't be sure if you're accurate. ""This will allow us to slowly reduce the size of our incision and that reduces pain and swelling post-operatively."" The robot could also open up an opportunity to create 'personalised' joints. Current replacements are designed for average-sized bones and to fit onto the flat cuts from a saw. But the robot can help make cuts of any size and shape. Each robot costs Â£750,000, but if it can speed up recovery times for one of the NHS's most common operations it could prove cost-effective.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
RBS pulls Samsung Galaxy S10 app over security flaw,"Last week, users found the device could be unlocked by anyone via its fingerprint authentication system when used with certain screen protectors. S10 owners will be unable to download RBS apps until the issue is fixed. The bank is also encouraging those with the app already downloaded ""to disable biometrics on their device"". However, it would not confirm whether it had warned all 200,000 of its customers who use the Galaxy S10. Nationwide Building Society and HSBC have issued similar warnings to customers, along with banks in Israel and South Korea, according to reports. Meanwhile, Wechat and Alipay, who together dominate China's mobile payments market, have reportedly disabled the fingerprint payment option on their apps for the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10. So far there have been no reports of people using the glitch to commit fraud - but banks are urging customers to be vigilant. An HSBC UK spokeswoman said: ""We have been in direct contact with customers who may be affected by the potential Samsung security issue, and have recommended that they disable their phone's fingerprint authentication until a fix is confirmed and they've updated their device."" The flaw was spotted last week by a British woman, whose husband was able to unlock her Galaxy S10 with his thumbprint when it was stored in a cheap case. After buying a Â£2.70 gel screen protector, Lisa Neilson registered her right thumbprint and then found her left thumbprint, which was not registered, could also unlock the phone. She then asked her husband to try and both his thumbs also unlocked it. When the screen protector was added to another relative's phone, the same thing happened. The couple told the Sun newspaper it was a ""real concern"". When the S10 was launched, in March, Samsung described the fingerprint authentication system as ""revolutionary"". Unlike other ID systems, a scanner sends ultrasounds to detect 3D ridges of fingerprints in order to recognise users. However, reports have suggested some screen protectors are incompatible with the reader because they leave a small air gap that interferes with the scanning. Samsung has said it is ""aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch"". Banks understand a fix will be rolled out this week, but on Thursday the South Korean firm was unable to confirm when that might happen.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Parking fine appeal success varies between council areas,"Some English councils approve only one in 10 appeals against on-street fines, while others accept nearly every one. Runnymede Council in Surrey accepted just 9% of appeals while Basingstoke - just 30 miles away - approved 95%. Figures obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show about a third of driver challenges were accepted. The figures cover initial challenges to on-street parking fines received from drivers between January and October 2016. They were obtained from 98 English local authorities through Freedom of Information requests by the Press Association. Runnymede received 1,011 challenges to parking fines, with only 93 being accepted. Staffordshire County Council also accepted challenges at a rate of about one in 10 (10.4%). By contrast, Basingstoke and Deane accepted 540 challenges out of 566 - a rate of more than 95%. Overall, almost 7,600 fines were issued in the borough overall during the 10-month period. 'Terrible signing' A spokeswoman for Runnymede Council said fines over yellow lines and dropped kerb offences ""aren't often open to much ambiguity"". ""We use our own staff to carry out enforcement, who are experienced and well trained in the role and therefore only issue notices where necessary,"" she added. Basingstoke and Deane councillor Simon Bound said it took a ""pragmatic"" approach to issuing fines which leads to a low number of formal appeals. ""Is the objective to fight to make sure the fine is paid, or is it about engaging with the resident and having the conversation about educating them to park better? They won't get an appeal approved if they do the same thing at another point in time."" Regional variation was also noticeable in Berkshire - drivers in Slough (23%) were nearly three times less likely to get off their ticket than in nearby Bracknell Forest (64%). Guy Anker, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said many drivers were often ""completely bamboozled"" about where they could park. ""Often the real problem is really poor, terrible signing."" Mr Anker said that after having a challenge rejected by the council, about 50% of drivers who make a further appeal to the independent Traffic Penalty Tribunal are successful. He said: ""I would encourage everyone who feels they are being harshly treated by their council to make an appeal to the independent arbitrator.""

Government body had 'concerns' over Pangbourne pesticide spray,"By Linda SerckBBC News, South A Freedom of Information request showed Natural England's worries about the method being used to kill off the larvae of a caterpillar. However, it still permitted spraying to take place at two copses in Pangbourne using a helicopter. A Forestry Commission spokesman said it was the ""least damaging"" way to tackle a larvae that ""could be a serious problem to human and tree health"". The spraying took place at the Herridge and Broom Copses, both within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), in an attempt to eradicate the oak processionary moth (OPM) larvae. The caterpillar which feeds at the top of oak trees contains a toxin in its hairs that can cause itchy rashes, eye and throat irritations. Natural England licensed the Forestry Commision (FC) to carry out the aerial spraying of the pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) - the first of its kind in the UK. But a Freedom of Information (FoI) request submitted by concerned Pangbourne resident Antoinette Earl showed Natural England believed the spray would have ""a very significant impact"" on other moths and butterflies in the area. The body's briefing report also stated the method would not succeed in ""eliminating OPM from this woodland"". Miss Earl has called the spraying an ""act of environmental vandalism"". She added: ""I decided to look into it further, and I was shocked to discover that Natural England was opposed to the spraying, but approved it, against the advice of its own expert scientists, knowing that the impact could be devastating to rare species and the wider food chain at this very sensitive site."" Natural England said in a statement that it did indeed have ""concerns"" that other species of moth and butterfly ""may be impacted"" but that ""the effects on these populations would be short-lived and they would rapidly re-colonise"". It added that it granted consent on condition that a five-year monitoring programme of birds, moths, butterflies and bats would be carried out on the site, compared with other unsprayed woodlands in the area. Miss Earl said she was concerned the pilot exercise would lead to aerial spraying elsewhere. ""OPM is a big issue in several London boroughs,"" she said, ""and I worry that the Forestry Commission will use Pangbourne as the starting point for a much bigger spray operation there, with the potential for a massive impact on wildlife across a much wider area."" A Forestry Commission spokesman said of the OPM larvae that it ""shared concerns about the potential impacts of the options for controlling it"", but that it had ""worked closely with scientists and regulators"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Russian iTunes Store shows porn images by mistake,"Movies without images have been linking to xxx.xxx web address. The intention might have been to link to a placeholder, said one IT expert, but addresses ending in .xxx are real websites with explicit content. Apple rolled out the service in Russia on Tuesday, along with another 55 countries; the firm had no comment when approached by the BBC. Although users were seeing pornographic images, they were not able to actually buy or rent these films, said Top F Secure IT researcher Mikko Hypponen. ""If someone actually clicks on such a movie and buys it, they won't get a porn movie - they will get what was supposed to be there, a real film, but the image was just wrong,"" he said. ""It's like when you go to a real-world video rentals store and all the DVDs are there but the covers for some of them are wrong. ""It's accidental - as I understand the situation, as they were adding content, they were a bit rushed and didn't have images for every single movie cover. 'Serious blunder' ""So for those images that they didn't have yet, they had to enter a web address - a URL - of where the image was supposed to come from, but there was no URL to put in yet - so they just put xxx.xxx thinking that they will put in a real address later."" He said the mistake was easy to fix - Apple simply had to link movies with a missing image to Apple's front page, for example. Graham Cluley from IT security firm Sophos called it ""a serious blunder by Apple"". ""The last thing you want to happen if you're downloading Kung Fu Panda for your kids is find out that you're looking at hardcore porn instead,"" he said. ""It's sloppy of Apple not to have tested their software thoroughly and properly before rolling it out to the masses, but it could have been much worse. ""If the webpages had contained malicious code, for instance, then it might have been possible for unsuspecting users to click on dangerous links or have had their computers infected by malware. ""As it is, it's more likely to be a case of them having to wipe the unpleasant images of what they saw from their memory than wipe a Trojan off their hard drive."" Web addresses ending in .xxx went on sale in 2011 following years of wrangling over whether a specific adult content address was needed. ICM Registry was finally awarded the right to administrate the new domain. It put .xxx on a par with more conventional web addresses such as .com and .org.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death,"Megan Lee, 15, suffered irreversible brain damage after having an allergic reaction to food from Royal Spice in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, in 2016. Mohammed Abdul Kuddus and Harun Rashid were found guilty in October. At Manchester Crown Court earlier, Kuddus was jailed for two years and Rashid for three. In sentencing, Mrs Justice Yip told them Megan was responsible enough to highlight her allergies when placing the order but ""sadly the same responsibility was not at your end"". Judge Yip said the takeaway had no systems or processes to manage allergen control. She said she hoped ""the message is heard"" that food suppliers who fail to take proper care ""will face significant custodial sentences if a death results"". After the verdicts in October, Megan's father Adam warned takeaway owners ""do not play Russian roulette with precious lives"". Judge Yip added: ""Like Mr and Mrs Lee, I hope that this tragic case adds to the growing awareness in the food industry of what can happen if allergies are not taken seriously."" She added that Kuddus and Rashid, both fathers, had expressed genuine remorse. She told them: ""Neither of you actually foresaw the death of anyone. It never occurred to you that you would be responsible for the death of a young girl. ""You must now live with the guilt of what you have done and the suffering you have caused Megan's family and to your own families."" Never be the same Owner Kuddus, 40, of Belper Street, Blackburn, had admitted two health and safety charges on behalf of himself and the takeaway, but both he and Rashid, 38, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, denied manslaughter. Their trial heard Megan suffered an acute asthma attack after eating food from Royal Spice on 30 December 2016, which her friend had ordered with a note reading ""prawns, nuts"" to show her allergies. She died two days later in hospital. The teenager's meal, which included an onion bhaji, a seekh kebab and a Peshwari naan, was found to have the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. In a statement read outside court after the verdicts, Mr Lee and his wife Gemma said their lives would never be the same after Megan's death.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
EasyJet half-year loss widens on weaker pound,"The airline recorded a loss of Â£212m in the six months to March. That compares with a loss of Â£21m in the same period a year ago, when Easter was in March and before the pound was hit by the Brexit vote. However, EasyJet said its performance had been ""resilient"" and the losses were in line with market expectations. Total revenue grew 3.2% to Â£1.827bn and it flew a record 33.8 million passengers in the six months, up 9% from a year before. Even so, investors were not impressed with the results, sending the airline's shares down nearly 7% in afternoon trading. Holidays prioritised EasyJet's chief executive, Carolyn McCall, told the BBC's Today programme that Â£82m of the loss was down to the weakness of sterling. She said it was normal for the company to make a loss in the first half of its financial year. ""Nineteen out of 21 years Easyjet has lost money in the winter and actually airlines do lose money in the winter,"" she said Ms McCall added that she was relatively unconcerned about the squeeze on living costs, particularly affecting the UK, where wages are growing more slowly than inflation. ""British people and all Europeans value their holidays, and so they actually prioritise their holidays over everything else,"" she said. ""One survey said British families were saying they would pay for a family holiday over buying kids' clothes."" EasyJet said that it was on track to gain its European Air Operator Certificate by the summer. It needs this to make sure that it can still operate between European Union member countries after the UK leaves the EU. A third of its flights are between EU countries and do not involve the UK. Gaining the certificate will lead to a one-off cost, mainly for aircraft registration, of up to Â£10m over three years, with up to Â£3m of that this year. The carrier said that bookings for the summer were ahead of last year, showing that demand to fly remains strong. It added that it expected to meet current forecasts for its performance for the rest of the year. In a separate announcement, EasyJet said it would be launching its largest pilot recruitment drive in June, as it looks for an additional 450 pilots.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Everest: Top Sherpas slam Nepal's plan to clean rubbish from mountain,"By Surendra PhuyalBBC Nepali The government says the army will be used for the task, which will cost 860 million Nepali rupees ($7.5m; Â£5.7m). Last year, they managed to clear about 10,000kg of waste from the region. But Kami Rita Sherpa - who has scaled the world's highest mountain a record 24 times - says they do not have the skills to reach the highest points. ""They collected garbage from lower altitudes,"" Sherpa told BBC Nepali, adding: ""They should mobilise Sherpas to clean up garbage from higher elevations. ""Only Sherpa guides and porters can do that. They should be given proper compensation to clean up the mountains."" The six peaks - Everest, Lhotse, Pumori, Amadablam, Makalu and Dhaulagiri - attract climbers from around the world each year, who often abandon oxygen and cooking gas cylinders, climbing gear and other rubbish like food wrappers, cans and bottles in their attempts to reach the summits. But the climbs are not without danger, and numerous people die each year - Everest saw 11 deaths in 2019. Many of the bodies are left on the mountains, so need to be brought down as part of the clean up. But it is particularly difficult to bring items down from the higher reaches. In some cases, bodies and rubbish have lain for decades in the snow and ice. ""Climbing Sherpas are the right people to clean up the peaks,"" Purba Tashi Sherpa, who's scaled Everest 21 times, said. ""The government should keep that in mind."" Nepali Army spokesman Bigyan Dev Pandey said he was confident his team would be able to reach the upper areas during this year's clean up, which ends on 5 June. ""We are learning from our mistakes and working hard to clean up the mountains, including the higher elevations."" he told BBC Nepali. Nepal's government has also brought in measures to encourage people not to litter, asking for a $400 deposit, which is returned if they bring their waste back down with them. But it is not easy, the Sherpas acknowledge. Even with their skills, they can struggle. Ang Tshering Sherpa, the former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association, told BBC Nepali: ""It's really hard to bring back heavy cylinders or dead bodies from the higher camps. ""Sherpa often risk their lives to do so. Most of the iced bodies weigh as much as 150kg, and that looks impossible for Sherpas to bring down.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Concern raised over changes to probation service,"By the beginning of next year, 70% of its work in England and Wales will be run by private companies and charities. The UK government said it will make the system more robust and will cut reoffending rates. But Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, who is a member of the justice committee, told BBC's The Wales Report he fears for public safety. The 35 probation trusts in England and Wales have been replaced by 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs). 'Stubbornly high' They will supervise 200,000 low and medium-risk offenders each year, while a new public sector organisation called the National Probation Service (NPS), will supervised and rehabilitate 31,000 high-risk offenders. Companies involved will be paid based on their results and the UK government says the changes will create a more efficient system. But Mr Llwyd, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, has attacked its motives for the changes. ""What we've got is the dismantling of a very professional highly regarded service, for what I believe to be purely dogmatic reasons,"" said Mr Llwyd. ""In other words - private good, public bad."" ""I fear for the public services and I fear for public safety, because this experiment is a dangerous, and may I say, needless one as well,"" he added. Napo, the probation officer's trade union, opposes the changes and warned the service in rural parts of north Wales, Powys and Aberystwyth might suffer. 'Invest in system' It said the new system will restrict the availability of staff to provide cover during absences, meaning more time travelling and less time managing cases. Tracey Worth co-chair of NAPO Cymru, said: ""You go to somewhere like Brecon and members say that they only have two probation officers to begin with. ""Then you split that office in half, how do you manage leave? How do you manage sickness? What will happen when a case comes in?"" But Andrew Selous MP, Minister for Prisons, Probation and Rehabilitation, said the government was trying to tackle the ""stubbornly high"" reoffending rates of the past decade. ""A responsible government responds to that, and doesn't go on doing what it has always done before,"" said Mr Selous. ""It looks to drive down reoffending rates, to invest in the system, to bring in new ways of working, to keep the best of what the public sector has to offer.""

Extreme pubic grooming 'may not cause sexually transmitted infections',"The findings go against past research warning shaving and waxing could leave cuts in the skin and help sexually transmitted infections to take hold. If left untreated, STIs can make getting pregnant more difficult. Using condoms correctly during sex is the best form of protection. STIs, which tend to affect young people and men who have sex with men, can usually be treated with antibiotics. In this small study by Ohio State University, 214 women were asked how often and how much they groomed their pubic hair, and then tested for an STI. While 53% said they had removed all their pubic hair every week in the past year and 18% in the past month - defined as ""extreme groomers"" - just 10% of the women tested positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea. The results showed no evidence of a link between extreme grooming and the risk of getting an STI, the researchers said. The chances of getting an STI were the same between extreme groomers and other groomers, the study in Plos One found. The researchers said their findings were more accurate than previous research because they took into account factors such as frequency of sex, income, race and age. Women who have more sex with more people - and are therefore more likely to develop infections - are more likely to be regular groomers, they said. Almost all the women in the study said they had engaged in some degree of grooming at some point, using a non-electric razor. Most of the women tested were white and single. Jamie Luster, study author, said it was important for women to know that information found on the internet or heard from friends was not necessarily correct. She said there were other steps they could take to reduce the risk of STIs. ""The most certain way is to not have sex,"" she said. ""If you are sexually active, ways to reduce the risk of STIs include using condoms properly every time you have sex, having fewer and monogamous sexual partnerships, and getting vaccinated against HPV, which is one of the most common STIs.""

Coronavirus: Survey suggests business confidence at record low,"The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) survey suggests retail and construction have been among the worst hit sectors during the Covid-19 crisis. But 95% of tourism firms also reported a fall in business confidence. The SCC said the UK and Scottish governments need to accelerate investment plans in order to prevent a ""tsunami of jobs"" being lost. The survey, conducted between April and June, found cash flow has sunk to a record low in many industries, with a high number of companies applying for credit to see themselves through lockdown. Tim Allan, president of the SCC, said: ""In many instances, these results are among the worst over the 30-year history of the survey. ""It is critical that governments in Holyrood and Westminster continue to provide business support for companies during and beyond the easing of lockdown restrictions. ""A sudden end to these vital financial support measures would not be welcome by anyone and a tsunami of jobs would disappear overnight."" Mr Allan warned local economies ""may be lost forever if action is not taken now"". The quarterly SCC survey covered 525 firms operating in Scotland and it shows a 70% decrease in confidence in the construction sector. Elsewhere, around half of manufacturing firms in the survey reported falls in orders and sales revenue trends in retail ""have massively fallen"". Prof Graeme Roy, director at the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, said that the latest survey painted a sombre picture of the scale of the challenge now facing the Scottish economy. He added: ""What is particularly worrying is the employment outlook. The survey shows a clear warning of what is to come, with a sharp rise in unemployment now inevitable as businesses adjust to a new normal. ""The immediate priority for many businesses is survival.""

Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty,"David Martin, the MEP responsible for its report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (Acta), said the treaty threatened civil liberties. His comments came less than three months after the previous rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned from his post in protest at the plans . To date, 22 EU member states have signed the agreement. However, the treaty will need to be ratified by the European Parliament before it can be enacted. Mr Martin has strongly advised that this ratification should not happen. ""The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties,"" he said in a written recommendation to the European Parliament . ""Given the vagueness of certain aspects of the text and the uncertainty over its interpretation, the European Parliament cannot guarantee adequate protection for citizens' rights in the future under Acta."" Co-ordinated attacks An early discussion paper for Acta was made public by Wikileaks in 2008, and the treaty has caused considerable controversy since. Earlier this year, thousands of protesters demonstrated in cities including Berlin and Warsaw to share their objection to the agreement, which critics say will stifle freedom on the internet. The ""real world"" action was in addition to several co-ordinated online attacks on the websites of various governments across Europe. Concern over the treaty was heightened further when the European Commission asked the European Court of Justice to rule on its legality. The decision is still pending. Mr Arif, who resigned as the EU's rapporteur for Acta on 27 January, described the negotiations as a ""masquerade"". He said: ""I condemn the whole process which led to the signature of this agreement: no consultation of the civil society, lack of transparency since the beginning of negotiations, repeated delays of the signature of the text without any explanation given, reject of Parliament's recommendations as given in several resolutions of our assembly."" Despite these concerns, the agreement has been backed by the majority of EU member states, including the UK. In January the UK's Intellectual Property Office said in a statement: ""Acta is important for the UK as it will set an international standard for tackling large-scale infringements of IPR, through the creation of common enforcement standards and more effective international co-operation."" ""Importantly, it aims to improve the enforcement of existing IPR laws, not create new ones."" A debate on the EU's adoption of Acta is expected to take place in June.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Nuisance calls out of control, says taskforce","It also wants company directors to be held responsible for unwanted phone calls from their businesses The taskforce has recommended that the threshold at which regulators are able to act on complaints should be lowered. The Nuisance Calls Task Force said cold-callers should not cause ""severe distress"" to consumers. Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) cold-callers could face fines of up to 20% of their annual turnover under the proposals. And Ofcom and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) will be able to share information on rogue companies. Up to one billion unwanted phone calls are received by members of the public in the UK each year, the taskforce said. Out of control Which? executive director and taskforce chairman Richard Lloyd said many British firms were ""breaking the law"". He said companies that were contacting people despite their having ""opted out"" of receiving direct marketing calls were acting illegally. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way in which the law was enforced had not been good enough. Mr Lloyd said the trade in personal data, responsible for the vast majority of nuisance calls, was ""out of control"", adding that the ""market in personal data needs properly investigating and sorting out"". He also called on regulators to clamp down on the abuse of existing legislation. ""We want to see business with good reputations that aren't keeping a close enough eye on this making sure that there is someone senior on their board who will be held to account if those nuisance calls are being generated by that businesses activity,"" Mr Lloyd said. Between April and June this year, 40,000 people complained to the Information Commissioner about unwanted live or automated calls to their phones. Most focused on accident or PPI claims, as well as some debt consolidation company calls. The Nuisance Call Task Force said many consumers did not know that they had unwittingly given their consent to be contacted by these companies. Plague Ed Vaizey, the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy, said: ""For too long, nuisance calls have plagued consumers, often at very inconvenient times of the day and in some cases, leaving vulnerable people like the elderly too scared to answer the phone. ""That's why we're determined to tackle this scourge through the first-ever nuisance calls action plan. ""We've already made progress, including making it easier for Ofcom to share information with the ICO about companies breaking the rules, and we're currently looking at lowering or removing the legal threshold before firms could be hit with fines of up to Â£500,000.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Intensive care demand surged at peak of crisis,"An official report on Covid cases requiring intensive care shows demand peaked on 29 March, with 29 patients admitted in a single day. Admissions remained close to the this level for about one week, to 6 April. The median age of patients admitted to ICU was 60, with men significantly outnumbering women. The report by the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) indicates that, for a period of almost four weeks, intensive care units were operating at above their normal capacity. More ICU beds At the peak of demand, normal capacity was exceeded by 46%. But no patient was turned away. The previous number of 173 ICU beds had been increased rapidly, and currently stands at 585 beds. The report, published through Public Health Scotland, is the most detailed analysis so far of the 516 admissions to ICU of patients suffering from Covid-19. Key points from the report include: The overall rate of admission to intensive care has declined sharply since the end of March. From the daily peak of 29 patients, it had fallen to an average of one per day by the end of May. Interim Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the ""hard work"" put in to increase the number of ICU beds ensured there was sufficient capacity to meet demand. ""The plans put in place by local health boards and the Scottish Critical Care Delivery Group to prepare ICUs to deal with the pandemic meant that, even at its peak, ICUs have been operating within the capacity available,"" he said. ""I would like to thank the exceptional hard work, commitment and on-going dedication to service that has been demonstrated by our NHS staff across Scotland."" 'Much to be proud of' Intensive care bed capacity can now be increased to 700 if required. Dr Stephen Cole, the president of the Scottish Intensive Care Society, said: ""Working with the Scottish government and national procurement, we were able to provide the potential for more than 700 ventilated ICU beds, four times the base capacity across Scotland. ""Scotland has much to be proud of in the way that the pandemic has been managed. ""I have no doubt that the death toll would have been greater without the unwavering support and close working relationship between the government and the clinical community.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Oxford top of global university rankings,"By Sean CoughlanBBC News family and education correspondent The annual Times Higher Education world rankings put Cambridge in third place and Imperial College London in tenth. But there is a warning from the compilers of the rankings that other UK universities are ""struggling to hold their own"" against global rivals. They warn Germany is ""poised to overtake"" the UK in having the most top universities in Europe. The rankings show Oxford once again named as the best university in the world, ahead of a US university - the California Institute of Technology - in second place. Global competition US universities continue to dominate the rankings, taking seven of the top 10 places and 60 out of the top 200. Asian university systems are catching up - with China and Japan continuing to perform strongly in the rankings. Iran's universities are among the ""biggest climbers"" in this year's league table. The full list is of 1,300 universities in 92 countries, with the rankings taking into account teaching quality, the volume and reputation of research, citations of research, income from industry and international links. An analysis accompanying the rankings says that the UK's so-called ""golden triangle"" - Oxford, Cambridge and London universities - continues to be very successful. But it warns that this is ""masking"" a relative decline for other UK universities, while German universities are rapidly improving in the league table. Since 2016, the number of UK universities in the top 200 has fallen from 34 to 28, while the number of German universities has risen by three to 23. International partnerships The analysis from the Times Higher Education says this could reflect higher levels of investment being put into Germany's university system. It also warns that UK universities could fall further behind Germany in funding if they lose access to EU research partnerships after Brexit. ""If the UK starts to withdraw from the international stage, its position in the upper echelons of the rankings will suffer,"" says Phil Baty of the Times Higher Education rankings. The vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, said: ""Oxford's success is in large part due to our research collaborations with other excellent universities around the world and we remain determined both to deepen and to expand these partnerships, whatever Brexit brings.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Israeli 'Freedom is basic' niqab advert criticised,"By George Pierpoint, BBC Newsand Osob Elmi, BBC News The ad, for clothing brand Hoodies, opens with a caption reading ""Is Iran here?"" and shows Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli wearing a face veil. Ms Refaeli then removes the niqab and dances before a voiceover states: ""Freedom is basic."" The video has been viewed thousands of times on various social media platforms and has triggered outrage and attracted accusations of Islamophobia. It comes at a time of rising tension between Israel and Iran. Many took to social media to express their disappointment and anger at the advert. Bar Refaeli also shared the video on her Facebook page. Ms Refaeli is one of the most prominent Israeli supermodels, and has more than five million followers on Instagram and Facebook. Popular Israeli-Arab vlogger Nas Daily shared his reaction to the advert with his almost 10 million followers on Facebook. He called the advert ""terrible"" and said he felt ""angry"" about the representation of Islam and women generally. The online clip is part of a wider marketing campaign by the company which includes billboards and TV adverts. The video was viewed more than 200,000 times on Instagram before it was removed by Hoodies on Tuesday evening. However, an alternative version was later uploaded to the company's YouTube account, also featuring a Muslim woman wearing a head scarf and a Jewish man wearing a skullcap (kippah). Also the slogan ""Is Iran here?"" has not been used. The ads, many of which pose the question ""Is Iran here?"", are particularly divisive in the context of increasing tensions between Israel and Iran. Iranian authorities have in the past year detained women who have protested against the country's compulsory hijab laws and human rights activists who have defended them. In Israel there are no specific rules about what women should wear. While the vast majority of reaction to the advert has been critical, some social media users suggested that the company was highlighting human rights abuses in Iran. One commenter wrote: ""I think it is good they highlighted Iran's human-right abuses on forcing women to cover up. That should be the real story here. I did not see it about a religion, more about Iran forcing the women to wear certain clothes."" However, many questioned the insinuation that women who wear the niqab lack freedom and suggested people should be free to choose what they wear. The BBC has contacted Hoodies for comment.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
SNP conference: Sturgeon pledges childcare 'revolution',"The new SNP leader unveiled the ambitious plans at the party's conference in Perth. It would see the number of free hours increase from 16 to 30 every week. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to give every child - regardless of background - the best opportunity in life. And she said a call earlier this week by business lobby group the CBI for an extension of free childcare showed that industry leaders recognised its importance, not just to the lives of children, but also to the economy. The SNP had made free childcare a central part of its campaign ahead of September's independence referendum. 'Push forward' Ms Sturgeon told delegates at the conference: ""In the referendum, we proposed free comprehensive provision for all children from aged one. We didn't win the referendum, but I am determined that we will make progress. ""With the powers we have now, we will push forward. We already deliver 16 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four years old. ""From August next year, that entitlement will extend to 27% of two year olds as well. That is more hours of childcare than in any other part of the UK and we should be proud of that. ""But so important is good quality, extensive childcare to the school performance and life chances of young people, that we will go further still."" She pledged that the SNP's manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood election would set out an ""ambitious plan"" to increase childcare provision. ""By the end of the next parliament, my commitment is that all three and four year olds and all eligible two years olds will receive, not 16 hours, but 30 hours of free childcare each week,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that the scale of the plan would require major investment, including capital investment in school and nursery buildings. 'Better future' She added: ""Our flagship infrastructure project in this parliament has been the new Forth Bridge - the Queensferry Crossing. ""I want to make one of our biggest infrastructure projects for the next parliament a different kind of bridge. ""I want it to be comprehensive childcare, giving our young people the best start in life and a bridge to a better future."" Recalling her own childhood, Ms Sturgeon said she had grown up in a working class family, went to a state school and, thanks to ""hard work, great parents and free tuition"", became the first person in her family to go to university. She said: ""Education - above all else - is what has made it possible for me to stand here today. ""Not everyone can be first minister. But everyone - regardless of background and circumstance - should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. ""For too many of our young people today, that is not the reality. Stories like mine are still too often the exception. We must change that and, conference, I am determined that we will.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
At what age do you feel you have reached adulthood?,"Nationwide's study of 2,000 over-18s found more than one in 10 did not think of themselves as fully fledged grown-ups until they reached the age of 27. Lisa Daisy, 34, told the BBC: ""Even after a career, two children and being together with my partner for 10 years, it still took being married to make me feel grown up."" 'Earlier than my peers' But 42-year-old Carole Lutringer said she felt like an adult when she was very young. ""I had to cook from an early age, because my mother worked as a head teacher,"" she said. ""My mother came back home late, and my father was pretty useless in the kitchen. ""I had to be autonomous from really early on, and that's probably what made me feel grown up earlier than most of my peers."" Sana Khalid Khan also had adulthood thrust upon her. She said it had been the death of her father that had made her grow up, at the age of 17. ""Being the eldest sibling and child, a lot of responsibility was poured on my shoulders,"" she wrote on the BBC Family and Education News Facebook page. Join the conversation at the BBC Family and Education News Facebook page. Some people came to the realisation of adulthood in more prosaic fashion. Londoner Sam Nichols said a saucepan had made her realise how grown up she had become. ""I got excited about buying a new saucepan,"" she said. ""If that doesn't scream 'adulting', I don't know whatever will."" Nationwide study Of those 2,000 people asked did feel they were adults, the transition happened for half in their 20s, while a fifth said it happened in their 30s. One in 20 respondents felt they had not grown up until their 40s. Of those questioned, 55% said being an adult was dependent on major life events, for example having children, moving out of the parental home or getting married. Having responsibilities For others, such as Elaine Smith, in London, adulthood is merely a state of mind. ""I still don't feel grown up,"" she said. ""I can't believe I have full responsibilities of looking after a four-year-old. How did that happen? ""I'm 44 this year, so it may happen soon."" Commenting on Facebook, Sophie Caunter agreed. ""I'm 42,"" she said. ""I have an 11-year-old, a seven-month-old, a husband, and I still don't feel grown up."" Melinda Wilmot echoed her sentiments. ""I'm 58 and still waiting to grow up,"" she said. ""Growing up is overrated anyway,"" said Sophie. By Rozina Sini, BBC's UGC and Social News Team",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Shoreham air crash pilot 'flew too low' at Southport airshow,"Southport Airshow said the Jet Provost T5 the BBC has established was piloted by Mr Hill was seen too close to crowds and below the height set for the event. On Tuesday, Sussex Police revealed the 2014 Southport incident was part of its ""wider investigation"". Andy Hill was flying a Hawker Hunter in August when it plummeted on to the A27. 'Stop call' Southport Airshow flying director Dave Walton said: ""A stop call was immediately issued by the flying display director on the display radio frequency and the flying display was terminated. ""The pilot was debriefed, initially on the telephone and later in person and agreed to amend his display for the Sunday display. ""The CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) had an ops inspector at the air show who did not witness the event in person but was briefed on the course of events and the actions taken during the Saturday display, and also on the course of action decided upon by the FDD (flying display director) and FCC (flying control committee) for the Sunday display."" The BBC has not been able to speak to Mr Hill, but an expert has said there was never any immediate danger and the event was never ""life threatening"". George Bacon, from the British Air Display Association, said it was an ""occurrence"" not an ""incident"" - less serious in effect - and Mr Hill was always in control of the aircraft. He also stressed the point that this kind of transgression could happen to any pilot and for all sorts of reasons - sun in the eyes, moving to avoid a bird or another aircraft, or a strong wind. 'In control' Mr Walton said there was no ""other action officially required"" but the event was discussed with aircraft operator at a later date. George Bacon, who commentated on the display, told BBC North West Tonight: ""My initial view was that it didn't seem to be initially dangerous. It seemed to be very much in control. ""There was a CAA flight inspector present at the airshow. I know they had a discussion and a report was made to the main CAA office."" Sussex Police said the incident at the Southport Airshow in September 2014 formed a ""line of inquiry in our wider investigation"". The CAA said it took appropriate action at the time and continued to support the police and AAIB with their investigations. Mr Hill, a former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, was initially placed in a medically-induced coma following the Shoreham crash.

Gemma Arterton to play Nell Gwynn in London's West End,"The production has been playing at London's Shakespeare's Globe but will move to the Apollo in February. The play charts the rise of the 17th-Century actress from the slums to the stage - and into the heart of the king. Arterton, best known for screen work, has proved herself in plays such as the Globe's The Duchess of Malfi. Most recently, Arterton starred as Rita O'Grady in the West End musical Made in Dagenham, for which she won the Evening Standard best newcomer in a musical award. Her other theatre credits include The Little Dog Laughed, The Master Builder and Love's Labour's Lost, again at the Globe. She takes over the Nell Gwynn role from Gugu Mbatha-Raw whose Globe performance earned her a best actress nomination at the Evening Standard awards. 'Blissfully entertaining' On screen, Arterton most recently starred in the romantic comedy Gemma Bovery, in which she plays a young bride who becomes the fixation of the male residents when she and her husband try to establish themselves in a rural French village. Prior to that, Arterton made her name in the 2007 St Trinian's movie, for which she won Empire and National Movie Awards. She went on to become a Bond girl in Daniel Craig's second outing as 007 in Quantum of Solace. She has since starred in The Boat that Rocked and as Thomas Hardy's tragic heroine Tess of the D'Ubervilles in a BBC drama TV adaptation. The story of the real-life Nell Gwynn is one of an unlikely heroine who pulled herself up from her impoverished roots in London's Coal Yard Alley to become Britain's most celebrated actress, and the mistress of King Charles II. Jessica Swale's story has been described as ""blissfully entertaining"" by the Globe and focuses on how Nell has to keep her wits about her and play to her charms in order to survive at Court at a time when women were seen as second-class citizens. Swale directed playwright Nell Leyshon's Bedlam at The Globe in 2010, while her first play, Blue Stockings, was performed in 2013. The Globe theatre has a tradition of championing new writing and seeing works that began life on its stage make successful transfers to the West End. It most recently saw Farinelli and the King starring Mark Rylance make such a move, to great critical acclaim.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Italy's Giuseppe Conte tells populist leaders: 'Stop fighting or I'll quit',"Mr Conte said the parties must ""honour the government's obligations"" or he would ""simply end my mandate"". The fractious year-old coalition of the League and the Five Star Movement are at loggerheads on a range of issues. Italy faces tough decisions on spending and Mr Conte is seeking a clear mandate to continue debt talks with the EU. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, the prime minister urged a ""loyal collaboration"" from governing ministers and said he wanted ""a clear, unequivocal and speedy response"". On Tuesday, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League party, said he had no intention of bringing down the government. He said it was time to push through much-needed reforms - such as greater autonomy for the regions - and that he was ready to discuss such measures with his coalition partners. The Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio also said he wanted the coalition to survive and that he was ready to ""sit down around a table and start working"". ""We're ready to discuss the League's proposals for a flat-tax measure and more powers to local governments, we've always said yes to these measures - provided they are done in a certain way,"" Mr Di Maio told Italian daily Corriere della Sera (in Italian). Italy's Ansa news agency later reported that the two leaders had reopened dialogue and had already reached a deal to end a dispute over restrictions to public building projects, which are aimed at boosting the economy. Last week, Mr Salvini said he expected Brussels to impose a hefty fine on the country over its rising debt levels and made a number of controversial comments about the issue in interviews and on social media. ""At a time when youth unemployment is reaching 50% in some regions, someone in Brussels is asking us, under past rules, for a fine of â¬3bn (Â£2.7bn),"" he told radio station RTL. ""All my energy will go into changing these rules from the past,"" he said, adding: ""We will see if this little letter from Brussels in which they sanction us for debt accumulated in the past arrives."" But Mr Conte later warned against posting ""witticisms"" on social media or using the press to send ""ambiguous signals"" in the pursuit of resolving political issues. ""We have been tasked with designing the future of the country, which is different from playing to the gallery and collecting 'likes' on social media,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales,"By Matt LloydBBC Wales More than 50% of snake, newt and toad species are under threat globally, conservationists have said. Housing and road construction combined with a ""terrible public image"" are endangering populations. Now a charity plans to work on 76 sites across south and west Wales after securing funding for a four-year project to make a ""real difference"". Numbers of sand lizards, grass snakes, adders, common toads and great crested newts are dwindling in many parts of the UK. So the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust (ARC) is targeting former strongholds in a bid to strengthen populations ""before it is too late"". ""These creatures are at risk everywhere but we are trying to make the populations that do exist more robust before they become extinct,"" said Jon Wilkinson, regional programme manager. ""One of the major problems is the connectivity between populations is being reduced because of modern life: new houses, supermarkets, road improvements. ""Great crested newts are protected but need a cluster of ponds in case one dries up. Otherwise they could become extinct. ""But creatures are not able to move across the landscape and are intimidated by noise and people. ""The adder population has been dropping dramatically since World War 2 and grass snakes are often mistaken for adders because of their yellow marking so are attacked. ""Toads are called common but they're not common at all - in some areas of Britain they have gone completely."" The charity have been awarded more than Â£400,000 to help fund projects across Merthyr, Monmouth, Caerphilly, Bridgend, Port Talbot, Swansea, Gower and the Pembrokeshire coast. It says it now has a ""real opportunity to change"" the situation thanks to the National Lottery funding. The 'Connecting the Dragons' project will focus on: While the first two will take man-power, the latter could be the toughest of those tasks. Snakes have also suffered from an image crisis, but the ARC Trust hopes to change that by getting people to meet the creatures ""in the flesh"". The charity's patron, naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham, said: ""It's a sad and wholly inappropriate reality that 'survival of the cutest' is a very real factor in contemporary conservation. ""So for reptiles and amphibians - warty, slimy, misunderstood and feared - it's tricky. ""But they are ecologically as important as dormice, hedgehogs or red squirrels and equally in need of urgent study and protection.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Honour of Kings: China's most vilified online game,"By Timothy McDonaldBusiness Reporter, BBC News Access to Honour of Kings is now restricted to one hour a day for children aged under 12 and two hours for children between 12 and 18. The limits were put in place after the government-owned People's Daily labelled the game ""poison"" and called for more regulations. What is Honour of Kings? Also translated as Kings of Glory, Honour of Kings is a fantasy role-playing ""multiplayer online battle arena"" game. It's very similar to another Tencent game, League of Legends, which is the world's most popular PC game. There are a few differences. Unlike League of Legends, it's based on Chinese historical characters. It's also specifically designed for play on a mobile platform. This is a key reason it's so popular in China, where many gamers don't have access to a games console or PC at home. How does it make money? The app is free to download, but players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes to help them advance to the next level. Estimates about how much an average player spends vary from about $1.50 to $6 a month. That doesn't sound like much, but it all adds up in a game with more than 50 million monthly active users. Why are people worried about it? Parents and teachers worry that children are becoming addicted to the game. While hand-wringing over gaming is nothing new, Honour of Kings has drawn particular scorn from the government-owned People's Daily newspaper, which called it ""poison"" and a ""drug"" that harms teenagers. It also called for tighter regulatory controls of online games. Tencent's revenue model depends on getting existing gamers to spend more time on their products. Its last annual report says its strategy is to turn casual gamers into ""midcore"" or ""hardcore"" gamers. How important is Honour of Kings to Tencent? Tencent made $7.2bn in the first quarter of this year, and more than half - about $3.9bn - came from gaming. Two titles dominate its catalogue. League of Legends is its biggest title globally, but in China Honour of Kings is its highest grossing mobile game. Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game generated about $810.5m in the first quarter of this year. That would equate to about 11% of its total revenue. Could tougher regulations matter? Tencent is a huge company. Besides gaming it's in payment services, social media and messaging apps (notably the phenomenally successful WeChat). The great majority of Tencent's business is in China, so it's vulnerable to regulatory changes there. This could add to investor anxiety. After Tencent brought in the time limits, its shares fell 4%, wiping $12bn off its market value. But shares have rebounded slightly since then. As a whole, the company has grown more than 40% over the past year, and it says the limits won't have much impact on the bottom line, because children under 12 are only a small part of its user base.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Cambridge homeless man Raymond Boyle's killer, 18, jailed","Jack Robinson stamped on 53-year-old Raymond Boyle's head and back, in Jesus Green last June. He dragged him unconscious to the River Cam, where his body was later found. Robinson, 18, of no fixed address, had denied murder, during his trial at Cambridge Crown Court. He was told he must serve a minimum of 14 years. Speaking after the case, police said Robinson calmly walked to a friend's house after the attack, in the early hours of 22 June. He discarded his jumper on the way, and is thought to have swapped the laces of his trainers over concern forensic evidence would link him to the murder, police added. Mr Boyle's body was found at 02:00 BST and Robinson was arrested later that day. He claimed responsibility for the assault but denied dragging him to the water. 'Defenceless man' Police said Robinson's account changed numerous times during interview and later in court. During the trial, CCTV images were shown of Mr Boyle walking through the city before crossing Magdalene Bridge towards Jesus Green at 00:33 BST - the last time he was seen alive. An hour later, Robinson and his friend Daniel Mynott, also 18, were captured on the same camera heading in the opposite direction. Mr Mynott, of Haviland Way, Cambridge, had stood trial with Robinson on a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent and was cleared by the jury. Det Ch Insp George Barr said: ""This was a savage, unprovoked attack on a defenceless man. ""Robinson was involved in the attack which had been fuelled by alcohol, and was seen kicking and stamping on Mr Boyle while he lay on the floor. ""That assault was bad enough, but for Robinson to drag him, barely conscious, into the water where he stood no chance of survival, was sickening."" Mr Boyle's partner of 22 years, Carole, said he enjoyed a successful career in printing before drink took hold of his life as a result of a difficult childhood. ""He was deeply loved by everyone who was part of his life and will be greatly missed by all his family and friends,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
MP Yeo cleared by standards watchdog,"The Tory MP was secretly filmed by Sunday Times investigators posing as representatives of a fictional energy company seeking to hire his services. The paper said he had admitted telling a business associate what to say in evidence to the committee he chaired. But the watchdog said the newspaper had used ""subterfuge, misrepresentation and selective quotation"" in its report. The standards committee report said it ""deplored"" media stings but would ""not hesitate to act in such cases if wrongdoing had occurred"". The MPs criticised the tactics used by the Sunday Times in approaching Mr Yeo. ""We note the severe damage which is done to public trust by journalism which rests on a basis of subterfuge, misrepresentation and selective quotation,"" the report said. ""Media investigations can have a role to play in ensuring high standards of public conduct, but we note that in this case Mr Yeo has broken no rules and the only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves."" Bio-energy industry Mr Yeo, who is expected to resume chairmanship of the cross-party Environment Committee on Tuesday, said: ""I welcome this report. After a full investigation, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner accepted, as I have always maintained, that I did not break the rules of the House. ""This investigation included a thorough examination of the full video-recording produced - after a six-week delay - to the commissioner by the Sunday Times. ""Based on what I actually said, rather than what I was reported by the newspaper to have said, the commissioner found and the committee confirms that I have not acted in breach of the code of conduct."" Mr Yeo stood aside as chairman, in favour of Lib Dem MP Sir Robert Smith, while the standards watchdog investigated the allegations. The allegations date back to May, when John Smith, managing director of GB Railfreight, appeared before the committee. Mr Yeo publicly excused himself from questioning Mr Smith because of his acknowledged conflict of interest as a non-executive director and shareholder in its parent firm Eurotunnel. The MP's work for the company is declared in the MPs' register of financial interests and he mentioned it at the start of the committee hearing into the bio-energy industry. Mr Yeo, who referred himself to the parliamentary standards commissioner, has said he had chatted briefly with Mr Smith five days before the hearing during a visit to one of the company's freight trains. But he has ""absolutely and unreservedly"" denied the suggestion that he had told him what to say.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Indian media: Kashmir government,"The state gave a ""fractured mandate"" on 23 December after a fiercely fought election and no party crossed the 44-seat mark needed to form a government in the state. The regional People's Democratic Party (PDP) won 28 seats, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with 25 seats. The two haven't been able to agree on forming a coalition government, and that has led to the state coming under the president's rule. PDP leader Mufti Mohammad Saeed said his party was holding discussions with the BJP on government formation, but he admitted there were major differences between the two parties. ""Ideologically we are North Pole and South Pole but the state has given us a historic opportunity to unite Jammu with Kashmir and to unite the state with India,"" Mr Saeed told the Hindustan Times. 'Hearts and minds' He urged Mr Modi to use the ""historic opportunity"" to bring his Hindu nationalist party closer to the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. ""It is also Mr Modi's duty to connect Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country. You think they can keep the state under force? Hearts and minds have to be won. He is now the prime minister of the country,"" he added. The PDP wants the BJP to make its stand clear on Article 370 of the Indian constitution. The article gives the state a special status and allows it to make its own laws and have a greater autonomy. The BJP has traditionally been against the article, but Kashmiri parties, like the PDP, staunchly defend the state's ""special status"". An article on the First Post website reports that the ""PDP wants the BJP to give it a written assurance that status quo will be maintained on Article 370"". Reports say the BJP hasn't made its stand clear on the issue, but its chief Amit Shah has been meeting senior leaders to come up with a plan to form an alliance with the PDP. The Hindu reports that Mr Shah on Thursday met senior RSS leaders to discuss the issue. The BJP draws its ideological roots from the RSS and often consults it on key issues.

Proud Boys: Far-right group becomes LGBT trend online,"The trend is part of efforts to drown out posts and content related to a far-right, anti-immigrant group of the same name. Actors, artists and the Canadian armed forces are among those who have shared supportive pictures. The Proud Boys group has denied being a homophobic organisation. Since the beginning of last week, the term #ProudBoys has been tweeted more than 88,000 times. The majority of them have been posted since 1 October. That day, former Star Trek actor and LGBT rights activist George Takei suggested on Twitter that ""gay guys"" should use the hashtag to share pictures of themselves ""making out with each other or doing very gay things."" His tweet also referred to a similar campaign by Korean pop music (K-pop) fans, launched earlier this year. In support of the Black Lives Matter movement, Twitter users flooded social media with pictures of Korean musicians with the hashtags #WhiteLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter - tags which have been used online by people critical of the Black Lives Matter movement. Other participants of the latest #ProudBoys trend have included Bobby Berk, a host of the Netflix show Queer Eye. Canada's armed forces have also shared a picture of two men kissing, which has been shared over 27,000 times. Enrique Tarrio, chairman of the Proud Boys group, told US broadcaster CNN he is not sure what social media users are trying to achieve. ""I think it's hysterical,"" said Mr Tarrio. ""This isn't something that's offensive to us. It's not an insult. We aren't homophobic. We don't care who people sleep with. ""One of the messages they want to send with this is that they're trying to drown out our supporters, they're trying to silence us,"" he added. ""When you're trying to drown out other people's thoughts, I don't think there's anything progressive about that."" Founded in 2016 by Canadian-British right-wing activist Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys is a far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group. While not exclusively white, they have became notorious for violent confrontations against left-wing rival groups. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube have all banned the Proud Boys from their platforms. US President Donald Trump drew criticism last week after comments about the group during a presidential debate with Joe Biden. When asked to condemn white supremacist and militia groups, Mr Trump instead called on the Proud Boys to ""stand back and stand by"". Many members of the group, including Mr Tarrio, took his words as an endorsement. But the president has since said that he condemns the Proud Boys and all white supremacists.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Birmingham bin strike: Council 'backtracking on deal',"Unite said the council was sending out refuse trucks without ""leading hands"", who operate at the back of vehicles. It said the issue was ""at the heart"" of the long-standing argument, and that it was seeking a High Court injunction. Birmingham City Council said it ""entirely"" rejected Unite's claims. The three-month dispute in the summer of 2017 was sparked by plans to axe 113 of the supervisory leading hands roles, responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. The strike ended when the council agreed the staff would remain on their current wages but with new recycling roles. Howard Beckett, assistant general secretary of Unite, said the council was ""seeking to unpick"" the 2017 deal. He said the status of the ""safety critical"" role had been ""cemented in the legally binding agreement"" which brought the previous action to an end. Mr Beckett said the authority's actions were ""reprehensible and, we believe, unlawful"". The union said it was seeking the injunction to prevent Birmingham City Council from going back on the agreement, but the authority said the claims were ""simply without merit"". In the new dispute, which began in December, up to 300 Unite members have been working to rule over claims the council made payments to GMB members who did not walk out in the previous strike. There are plans to escalate the action, with weekly two-day walkouts planner later this month. A council report said striking bin workers had been offered up to Â£3,000 each to end the dispute and that the mounting rubbish could create a fire risk for tower block residents. In response to the legal claim, Birmingham City Council said leading hand roles didn't exist and had been replaced by ""waste reduction collection officers"" in September 2018. It said bin lorries without ""waste reduction collection officers"" were staffed by contractors - brought in, it said, due to the industrial action - which ""falls outside the remit of the agreement"". The dispute has been listed for a high court hearing on 13 February. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Council demanded payment card details via email,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Islington Council had required residents to share the security code from the rear of their cards, as well as their address, among other details. One security expert said this appeared to be a breach of the payment card industry's security rules. The system has now been suspended. ""We have begun an internal investigation into the process of applying for and paying for parking bay suspensions,"" a spokeswoman for the local authority told the BBC. ""In the short term, we have removed that form from our website."" The Local Government Association said it was not currently aware of any other incidents like this. 'Insecure method' The matter came to light after one resident contacted the council in order to secure a spot outside his home for a furniture-moving service. ""I was really surprised that they were collecting credit card details over email, because email isn't secure,"" said Dafydd Vaughan, who works for a technology consultancy. ""If something happened and the details were leaked, they could be used by other people, and the bank would hold me responsible for sending my details in an insecure way. ""I asked the council if I could pay online or over the phone, but was told that email was the only option."" One cyber-security expert said that Islington Council appeared to have violated a requirement that payment cards' security codes never be stored by third-parties. Scott Helme added that there were also several other ways to transmit the other payment information more securely. ""I hope the council will take steps to ensure they properly erase any historic data they have collected in this fashion and notify those involved of any risk they may face,"" he said. ""We need to know how many staff had access to these emails, could copies have been made, were they properly erased after use, or are they still stored. ""It will be interesting to see what steps will be taken to prevent incidents like this in the future given this seems to be the only way that constituents had to access and pay for this service."" The Payment Cards Industry (PCI) - which represents Visa and Mastercard among other issuers - sets rules for organisations that store, process and transmit cardholders' data. However, it is up to the individual companies to enforce compliance. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also introduced a legal requirement that ""appropriate technical"" measures be taken by organisations when handling such details. ""All organisations processing personal data have a responsibility to do so safely and securely,"" commented a spokesman for the Information Commisioner's Office. ""If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled, they can make a complaint to the ICO.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New Zealand's Dunedin jokes about losing 'steepest street' title,"For years, Dunedin's Baldwin Street proudly held that title, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records. But on Tuesday, the accolade went to a little lane in Wales. On the heels of the cricket loss, people couldn't resist joking about the second defeat to the UK within days. The case for Wales was brought by residents in the town of Harlech, who after hearing about Baldwin Street's accolade decided to contact the Guinness Book of Records - which duly transferred the title. Campaigner Gwyn Headley said: ""I feel utter relief - and jubilation. I feel sorry for the New Zealanders - but steeper is steeper."" People on Twitter had abundant suggestions for how Dunedin should deal with the issue. Change the signs to ""Southern Hemisphere's Steepest Street""? Or simply get some roadworks under way ""to make Baldwin Street a little steeper and grab that title back""? The gradient of Baldwin Street is 35%. And while that is very steep indeed, it can't challenge Ffordd Pen Llech's 37.45%. 'Hallelujah!' Resident Dave Kernahan, known as the unofficial king of Baldwin Street, was caught off guard by the news. ""You are bloody joking,"" he told the Stuff news website. The 68-year old has become somewhat of a tourist spectacle himself in recent years thanks to his habit of running and skipping up and down the street as many as 30 times a day. Still, it seems not everybody is distraught over the Kiwi contender's sudden decline. Baldwin Street was the kind of accidental tourist attraction that can be both a blessing and a bit of a nuisance for locals. ""Hallelujah!"" was the simple reaction of Tate Manning, cited in the Otago Daily Times. She said she hoped the change would mean fewer busloads of tourists. A family about to mark their 12-year-old twins' birthday with a climb of the famous street joked that they might have to doctor their photos to say ""second steepest"" street, the paper reported. ""It has the honour of being formerly the steepest street in the world,"" said the boys' mother, Ms Ruge. ""It's like 'the artist formerly known as.'""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cour du Parc renovation to begin in September,"Cour du Parc at La Charroterie in St Peter Port has been empty since 2011, when it was decided the building was not fit to house residents. The association plans to increase the existing 42 flats to 50, consisting of one and two bedroom properties. The 11-storey block will accommodate social tenants and States employees. Some of the flats will be made available to islanders on a partial ownership basis. Free bus cards There are only five car parking spaces available for residents at the site and increasing this number was ruled out as too expensive. Instead, 26 spaces will be provided in the basement for mopeds and motorbikes, along with secure storage for 60 bicycles. Residents will also be provided with a bus timetable and a bus travel card when they move in. The association's application to the Environment Department includes a map to illustrate that ""the entire commercial centre of St Peter Port"" is no more than 20 minutes' walk away. Externally, the building will have a new insulated covering which, it is claimed, will eradicate previous condensation issues and avoid the need to re-paint the outside, avoiding expensive re-scaffolding every few years. The cladding colour was described as ""a subtle mix of dark green, lighter green and some off-white panels to give a visual lift to the building without being garish"". The plans include solar panels on the roof to provide residents with hot water. Disabled access is to be provided into the building and throughout internally. Steve Williams, the association's chief executive, said: ""The building refurbishment does pose some technical challenges... but the GHA is currently out to tender and hopes to start refurbishment work, subject to planning and building control approvals, by this September."" GHA is financing the refurbishment from bank funding, with the Housing Department contributing the building in lieu of any financial contribution to the refurbishment costs. Mr Williams said he was unwilling to divulge the budget for the project, as the tendering process was underway - although the figures would be made clear at a later date. However, he said it was not as costly as the association's new-build housing projects. Housing Minister Dave Jones said: ""We're eager to see the building refurbished and occupied as soon as possible, so we're delighted at all the preparatory work the GHA has done to get us to this stage."" ""Currently, we still think that the refurbishment can happen without the States having to make any capital grant payment, but it's still early days to say this definitively.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tate Britain hits Â£45m renovation target,"Nine of the building's gallery rooms are being refurbished, as are the entrance area and other public spaces. The target has been reached thanks to a Â£4.9m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Â£1m given by Tate Members. The rest has been donated by private benefactors. The Tate fears if tax relief on donations is capped, such fundraising would prove difficult. ""Philanthropy has made a crucial difference to our ability to renovate these galleries and produce these new displays,"" Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota told BBC News. ""We all fear that the proposed cap on donations will discourage individuals from making this kind of donation."" The Tate's British art collection will be re-hung in a new chronological display in the refurbished galleries. They will have ""much improved illumination"", mainly thanks to increased natural lighting, while the reception will be moved from the rotunda to its original position in the foyer. Donors to the project include oil trader Ian Taylor and the Sainsbury family and philanthropist Dame Vivien Duffield, daughter of tycoon Charles Clore. Supporters 'rewarded' Money has also been provided from the estates of business figures including Sir Isaac Wolfson, Sir John Paul Getty, Sir Siegmund Warburg and Willard Garfield Weston. Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis said the building's architecture and art collection would ""enhance each other in a way which I hope and believe will reward our many supporters"". Sir Nicholas Serota said: ""I am extremely grateful to all the donors, foundations and the Heritage Lottery Fund who have helped us reach our funding target. ""This project provides a much needed upgrade to Tate Britain and will hugely improve both the galleries and facilities for our visitors."" Speaking about the proposed changes to tax relief on charitable donations, he added: ""I think the Chancellor is listening to the representations that are being made by the charitable sector as a whole. ""I think that's all we can expect at this point. The proposals, come into effect in 2013, not immediately. So there is some time. But, of course... these discussions cannot be protracted ones because uncertainty is really the enemy of philanthropic giving. ""People make their plans for 2013, 14, 15 now. It isn't so much impulse giving that is affected, but those people that are planning how to dispose of the income that they have, that they want to make available to the public sector.""

Tropical forests 'better managed',"By Richard BlackEnvironment correspondent, BBC News The area under some form of sustainable management plan increased by about 50% over the period; but about 90% of tropical forest lacks protection. The most significant improvements have been seen in Africa, the report says. The ITTO is a pro-sustainable use trade body whose 60 member countries account for 90% of the global timber trade. Its current report - Status of Tropical Forest Management 2011 - analysed data from 33 important forest countries, including the really big players such as Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia. ""The top line is that the area under sustainable forest management has gone up from 36 to 53 million hectares in five years,"" said Duncan Poore, one of the report's authors and a former head of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ""That's a substantial improvement, but there's still a long way to go,"" he told BBC News. ""Forests scheduled by ITTO members as permanent forest cover 760m hectares - so what's under sustainable management is less than 10%, which is disappointing."" Deforestation 'to continue' Countries that have made major increases in protection include Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Peru and Venezuela. However, satellite observations recently revealed an alarming escalation in deforestation in Brazil, indicating that loss of forest in some areas of a country can continue even as protection increases in other areas. ""My personal view is that it's more important to make sure that countries decide what forest they want to keep and for what purpose, and look after that satisfactorily, than to weep crocodile tears over deforestation,"" said Dr Poore. ""The reality is that in most countries, deforestation is going to continue. But if they look after areas that are really important ecologically, that may not be a problem."" The ITTO report makes clear that pressures leading to forest clearance are continuing to rise, with the expansion of the world's population, growing use of raw materials such as wood, and increasing demand for land on which to settle and grow food. The big hope of many in the conservation community is that rich countries may soon start funding poorer ones to protect forests in the interests of absorbing carbon dioxide and curbing climate change. But despite years of discussion, establishment of an international mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) remains elusive, largely because of wider disagreements within the UN climate convention. Bringing a REDD scheme into existence would, said Dr Poore, be ""very important"" for the long-term health of tropical forests.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Artist's designs for Alabama church bombing window on display,"The bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan was a new low in the fight for civil rights. As news spread around the world, Carmarthenshire artist John Petts made a pledge to design a replacement stained glass window for the church. His designs have now gone on display at the National Library of Wales. A campaign started by the Western Mail newspaper raised funds for Petts's venture in the days following the attack on 15 September, 1963. Iconic symbol In 1965, Petts, from Llansteffan, near Carmarthen, delivered the window which showed a black Jesus beneath a rainbow of racial unity - his right arm pushing away hatred and injustice, the left offering forgiveness. The National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth said the window was installed and dedicated with the words: ""Given by the people of Wales"". Today, the window is known as the Wales Window and is an iconic symbol of the American civil rights movement, says the library. Jaimie Thomas, the library's exhibitions officer, said: ""These exquisite designs are treasured by the library on behalf of the nation, not only for their artistic merit and historic worth, but as a symbol of the kindness of the people of Wales. ""To mark the anniversary, the drawings have recently been conserved and digitised as part of our online collection, and visitors to the library will have an opportunity to see the original designs on show until the end of the year."" The blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church was a defining moment of the civil rights era. Worst incident The church had been targeted because it was being used as a meeting place by black civil rights workers at the height of their campaign in the American south. It remains one of the United States' worst incidents of racial violence. The explosion killed Denise McNair, 11, along with Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins, all 14, as they got ready for a Sunday morning service. Speaking to the BBC in 1987, Petts recalled: ""They had never heard of Wales, they had no idea where it was, but they were very quickly told something of the little country Wales and how it put great value on independence and freedom, to bandy with the great big words. ""An idea doesn't exist unless you do something about it. ""Thought has no real living meaning unless it's followed by action of some kind."" Petts died in 1991. His window designs will be on display at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth until 14 December. Hundreds of people in Birmingham, Alabama, have marked the 50th anniversary of the attack by attending a service at the church.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Deepfake queen prompts 200-plus complaints to Ofcom,"The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. But commentators said the jokes made in the show were ""disrespectful"" and in ""poor taste"". The watchdog is now deciding whether to take action. In the video, the deepfake referred to rumours of rifts in the Royal Family, toilet roll shortages and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's number of children. The computer-generated version of the monarch also gyrated to music while dancing on top of a desk to show off ""moves for TikTok"". While the message did not carry a warning that it had been faked, its ending revealed the conceit: an actress was shown seated in front of a greenscreen, having her face mapped to create the digital replica. Deepfakes use technology to create what can be convincing digital copies of real people, which can be used to spread misinformation. But in this case, Channel 4 said it should have been obvious this was not the real Queen. ""It is very clear in the four-minute film that it is a parody of the Christmas Day address and viewers were left in no doubt that it was not real,"" a Channel 4 spokeswoman said. ""However, while the film is light-hearted, affectionate and comedic in tone, it carries a very important and timely message about trust and the ease with which convincing misinformation can be created and spread."" The video forms part of a series of programmes examining the spread of misinformation, she added. âDisgusting and disrespectfulâ Some viewers expressed their distaste on social media, with some labelling the video as being ""disgusting"". Making âcheap jokesâ about the Royal Family was in âpoor tasteâ, Penny Junor, a royal biographer and commentator, told the BBC. âThe Queen has had a tough year and making those things into a national joke is tasteless. âShe has been extraordinary during the pandemic and shown real leadership and courage, stepping up at a time when many had lost trust and faith in politics.â Ofcom confirmed it had received 214 complaints about the episode and was now consulting the Broadcasting Code to decide whether a formal investigation is required. But this represents a relatively low number of complaints compared to: A review in the Telegraph noted that Channel 4 had a remit to take creative risks, but criticised the script for its ""toothless satire"" rather than for being offensive.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Islamic State claims Kabul's latest deadly attacks,"On Wednesday, 48 people were killed in the bombing of an education centre. Most of them were students studying for university entrance exams. On Thursday, a training centre for the intelligence services was attacked. IS said it carried out the ""commando"" operation and claimed to have caused high casualties. Afghan officials said at least two militants were killed but did not mention any other deaths or injuries. Also on Wednesday, Taliban militants said they could no longer guarantee safe passage for Red Cross staff working in Afghanistan, amid a row over the treatment of Taliban prisoners in a jail in Kabul. What is known about the two attacks? IS claimed the attacks via its media outlet Amaq. The militants said about 110 people were either killed or wounded in Thursday's attack that began in the morning. Meanwhile, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the attackers had fired rocket-propelled grenades as well as automatic rifles, and that security forces had held back from assaulting the building where the gunmen had taken position, Reuters reports. After some seven hours, officials said the two attackers were killed. Wednesday's attack on the education centre took place at about 16:00 local time (11:30 GMT). Afghan police said a suicide bomber walked into the education centre and detonated his explosive belt. At least 48 people were killed and another 67 injured. ""Most of the boys at the educational centre have been killed,"" Sayed Ali, who witnessed the blast, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""It was horrific and many of the students were torn to pieces."" Afghanistan has experienced a recent upsurge in militant violence, including a major Taliban assault on the eastern city of Ghazni. At least 100 members of the security forces were killed in the fighting at Ghazni, officials have said. The UN has warned that as many as 150 civilians may have also been killed.

Couple who met on Bardsey Island to be its new wardens,"Mari Huws, 27, and Emyr Glyn Owen, 33, will be looking after Bardsey Island off the LlÅ·n Peninsula from September. The couple replace the Scharer family, who left their role after their son was injured on a beach. The wardens will safeguard the environment that attracts scores of holidaymakers in the summer. Ms Huws, from Penygroes in Gwynedd, and Mr Owen, from Llansannan, Conwy, said the appointment was a chance to ""realise a dream"". The couple met for the first time on the island, known as Ynys Enlli to the Welsh-speaking couple, while playing a five-a-side football match there. The island boasts ten cottages that are home to holidaymakers who come to the island for a summer retreat and urban escape. There is no electricity, and cold water is fed to the homes from a spring. When they were told they had been appointed as the new wardens, Ms Huws said they cried with happiness: ""Our dream is coming true - and being able to do this with Emyr - that's better than a dream."" The couple said they sat down and listed the pros and cons of trying for the warden jobs. ""The biggest con about trying for the job was the disappointment we would have felt if we didn't get it,"" said Ms Huws. They are also under no illusions - it will be a ""challenging job"". ""It's going to be a lot of manual work, painting and gardening and decorating, but it will be rewarding work - and for every short and cold winter day, there will be magical long days in the summer,"" said Ms Huws. ""Apart from waking up every morning to one of the best landscapes in Wales, we're looking forward to having a wild, windy office and a new challenge every day. ""I can't wait to plant the garden in the spring and see what grows by the summer, and for all the buzz of the season when we welcome everyone to the island."" Known as the focus for the early Celtic Christian Church, the island was home to a monastery in the 6th Century, and was reputed to be the burial place for 20,000 ""saints"" in the middle ages, with three pilgrimages to Bardsey said to be equal one to Rome. ""We're at a perfect time in our lives to be able to pack up and live on an island in the middle of the sea for three years as well,"" added Ms Huws. ""We look forward to the challenge and the unique experience of living on Bardsey all season - a pack of cards, loads of books, a sense of humour, rolling up sleeves - and hello.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Calls for Wakefield asylum centre to shut after Covid-19 outbreak,"By Pritti MistryBBC News Dozens of residents have been dispersed from Urban House in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after the outbreak earlier this month. Campaigners said it was ""not fit for purpose"" and needed a ""major overhaul"". Mears Group, which runs the centre, said the property would be reviewed once the dispersal was complete. A report by the Commons Home Affairs Committee said the continued use of shared rooms in asylum accommodation made it ""extremely difficult"" for people to follow social distancing advice. MPs said stronger action is needed to protect people from the risk of a second wave of coronavirus. South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) said it had also been raising concerns of poor hygiene standards at Urban House and the welfare of residents during the initial dispersal of 84 asylum seekers. One asylum seeker, who cannot be named, complained of bed bugs in his room despite Urban House being cleaned regularly since the outbreak. John Grayson, former chair of SYMAAG and researcher, said: ""The place needs to close down with immediate effect. ""It needs major changes to bring it in line with current standards. People should have their own rooms and en suite facilities are crucial. ""It should be very clean and they really need 24-hour health care in there. He claimed the issue of ""bed bugs has been going on for years"". Chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper MP said sharing rooms was ""completely inappropriate"". She called for the Home Office to ensure safeguards were in place ""to prevent the virus spreading within asylum accommodation"". Mears Group said all residents were being moved out ""to dispersed accommodation as it becomes available"" after 21 people tested positive at the centre. A spokesman said Urban House had received a ""major"" revamp last year and met ""all contractual standards"". ""The Director of Public Health at Wakefield, PHE [Public Health England] and the Home Office will review the building and advise Mears on what basis the building could return to use in the current Covid-19 circumstances. ""Mears will follow all advice and operate accordingly."" The company maintained facilities at Urban House were regularly cleaned and social distancing arrangements were in place. The Home Office said it took the wellbeing of asylum seekers ""extremely seriously"" and had taken measures. ""This includes reducing the number of people in immigration detention and providing free temporary accommodation to asylum seekers to ensure social distancing, where free meals, toiletries and other support measures are provided.""

UK interest rates remain at record low of 0.5%,"It has also decided not to extend its quantitative easing programme, designed to stimulate lending in the economy, beyond the Â£375bn already spent. Rates have been at 0.5% since March 2009, with the market expecting a small rise early next year. In two weeks, the Bank will reveal how members of its rate-setting committee voted on the rates decision. Last month, two members voted for a rise. Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale voted to raise rates to 0.75% from 0.5%, as they had in August. The other seven members of the committee, including Bank governor Mark Carney, voted to keep rates unchanged. This year or next? There has been intense speculation over when the Bank will start to raise rates again. Markets are expecting an increase some time in the new year, although some commentators think it could be later this year as the Bank may not want to raise rates close to a general election, scheduled for May 2015. ""Overall, our central case still sees the Monetary Policy Committee raising rates next month, not least because we struggle to envisage the committee either beginning to tighten in the first few months of next year, so close to May's general election, or waiting until the summer,"" said Philip Shaw at Investec. The UK economy has been growing strongly this year - with GDP rising by 0.9% between April and June, following a 0.7% rise in the previous quarter - and is on course to outperform many other developed economies this year. However, recent figures have suggested that growth in the manufacturing sector is beginning to slow, partly due to a slowdown in the eurozone economy. In addition, the recovery in the UK economy has not filtered through to inflation, which fell to 1.5% in August. With inflation below the Bank's target rate of 2%, there is less pressure to raise rates to curb rising prices. Noting the slowdown in manufacturing and the eurozone, together with low wage growth, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""These developments are unlikely to reverse anytime soon, so 2014 is set to pass with interest rates remaining at current rock-bottom levels. ""And while rates will probably start rising in the first quarter of 2015, the risks point to that date being pushed back further.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Intensive care 'has lasting impact on mental health',"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News A study of 157 patients at University College Hospital, in London, found high levels of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. Critical Care Journal reports certain drugs combined with stress in hospital seemed to cause longer term problems. Doctors want to trial reducing stress and altering drugs in intensive care. Dr Dorothy Wade, a psychologist from University College London, said: ""The focus of intensive care is to save lives, to do whatever it takes."" However, she said, it could be a traumatic experience for some patients. ""Once they're starting to wake up and become conscious they can be in a terrified state, thinking they've gone mad or there's a conspiracy to steal their organs or to torture them."" Lasting impact The study found that three months later, 55% of the 157 patients had some form of psychological problem - 27% had post-traumatic stress disorder, 46% had depression and 44% had anxiety. The risk of developing the disorders increased depending on how long patients were sedated for and the drugs they were taking, such as those used for controlling blood pressure. Patients with sleep deprivation, hallucinations and nightmares were also at risk. Dr Wade said she was ""really surprised"" at how high the rates were. She added: ""As well as looking at modifying our drug treatments, we may need to invest more time in the psychological care of a patient and find ways to prevent psychological suffering in the intensive care unit which can affect the quality of their life in years to come."" Dr David Howell, who is the clinical director of critical care at the hospital, said: ""It is fair to say there hasn't been enough focus on the psychological aspects of recovery in intensive care and afterwards."" He said the study had established the scale of the problem and the big question now was: ""How can we make that better?"" Bob Winter, president of the Intensive Care Society, which represents doctors in the field, said: ""This is clearly an important study confirming in some cases what we have known in intensive care for some time, that what we do for patients has a psychological impact that extends well beyond their intensive care stay. ""What is interesting about this study is the fact that some of the associations seem to be modifiable. ""The association of benzodiazepine use with subsequent psychological symptoms has important implications for sedative practice in intensive care. There are also implications for how we make our interventions tolerable in terms of how we can reduce the duration of sedation.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
BBC World Service to lose 73 jobs,"25 jobs will go on the English-language service with news coverage reduced from 18 hours to 14 each weekday.

The BBC said audiences would continue to ""receive the best programming"" with ""fewer regional variations"". The BBC World Service has already made Â£30m in savings following its reduction in funding by the government in 2010. From 2014 the World Service will be funded from the licence fee, with up to 650 jobs to go over three years. The number of documentaries will be reduced from four weekly strands to three, with Your World axed. However, the BBC said no jobs would be lost as a result of this change. A total of 44 jobs will be closed in foreign-language services including BBC Afghan, BBC Burmese, BBC Bengali and in Africa, while posts currently vacant in other foreign services will no longer be filled. Efficient programming The number of specialist announcers on the World Service English language service will shrink and a new management team will work across distribution, channel management and commissioning. The BBC said a ""significant saving"" in changes to arts scheduling will ensure that arts coverage ""maintains prominence and relevance on the World Service"". An extended Outlook will now cover arts and music, with daily 10 minute section looking at the people behind the world of music, entertainment, film and the performance arts. Director of BBC Global News, Peter Horrocks said: ""By making these changes, we are achieving the savings required whilst crucially, ensuring our audiences continue to receive the best programming. ""As we prepare to move to licence fee funding, we will be able to demonstrate that the World Service remains strong despite the funding cuts of recent years, is more efficient than ever, and remains a vital force in today's complex media world."" The National Union of Journalists said the cuts ""fly in the face"" of the BBC's commitment ""to sustaining quality programming"". ""Slashing journalistic jobs and cutting programmes is a terrible assault on a much-loved institution that provides a lifeline to listeners around the world,"" said Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary. ""Instead of pressing on with these cuts, [BBC Director General] George Entwistle should be taking the opportunity to rethink the approach of his predecessor, and seize the chance to push for a renegotiation of the licence fee settlement. ""It's time for a fresh start and a real commitment to quality programming and journalism."" The latest job cuts and schedule changes were announced on Thursday to the 1,200 staff who work at the World Service. The BBC said the original estimate was for more than 100 job losses. Mr Horrocks said the broadcaster would consult the unions and staff to ""look for ways to reduce the number of compulsory redundancies where possible"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Telford abuse: New victims come forward to police,"It comes after the Shropshire town's MP Lucy Allan said she had been ""inundated"" with reports since speaking about the issue in Parliament. West Mercia Police said the reports relate to non-recent offences. The new reports have been made since the Sunday Mirror reported that up to 1,000 girls in Telford could have been victims of CSE since the 1980s. Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans said he was pleased that a ""small number of victims"" have had the confidence to come forward and they were now being given appropriate support. He confirmed that since 2016 the dedicated CSE team in Telford has arrested 56 people, resulting in 29 charges, with a number of these investigations still ongoing. ""The CSE reports we have received this week relate to non-recent child sexual exploitation offences and we will be reviewing them alongside any other available information, ensuring those reporting abuse are fully supported,"" he added. ACC Evans has urged other victims, or anyone with information about crimes of this nature, to come forward. West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford, said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people"" who were victims of CSE or considered ""at risk"" and claimed reported figures had been ""sensationalised"". However, Maggie Oliver, who resigned from her role as a detective inspector on the Rochale case over the way it was handled by police, said Telford will have more child sex victims than police claim to know about. She said: ""I've been saying since I first started speaking out publicly in 2011, and I went to the Home Office to say, that the figures that were being reported were not correct, they were being under-reported, under-recorded and the Home Office select committee accepted that. ""So these figures are not fabricated in my experience."" The Home Office has said the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will be looking at Telford in its investigation into CSE, but it is down to local authorities to decide whether a further review is necessary. Ms Allan is pushing for the council to commission a separate report, but the authority said it wants the government to launch it to ensure its ""independence and scope"" is not questioned. Operation Chalice Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009.

GP concern over Betsi Cadwaladr board's hospital plan,"But Dr Phillip Banfield said the proposals were the harsh reality of Wales' ""health care rationing debate"". Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) is the first in Wales to outline plans for balancing the books. Some of the plans under consideration involve the closure of two community hospitals in Flint and Blaenau Ffestiniog. The health board says it will listen to people's concerns during planned consultation being held over the summer before any decisions are taken. Â£65m shortfall Two community hospitals could close at Flint and Blaenau Ffestiniog with community hospital beds lost at Llangollen. Minor injury accident departments may shut at others with the loss of x-ray services under a major health service shake-up in north Wales. ""The GPs are very nervous about what may happen if community beds are restricted,"" said Dr Banfield, chair of the British Medical Association's Clwyd North division. ""Our colleagues in general practice have raised concerns about the effects of cuts on community services and this is why it is important the public get involved in the consultation process,"" said Dr Banfield, a consultant obstetrician at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital, Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire. Health board chief executive Mary Burrows told BBC Radio Wales the changes were about improving patient care and were not solely about costs as any changes will not be brought in until next year whereas the health board's current Â£65m shortfall was an ""in year problem"". She said the biggest problems faced by the organisation were costs due to staff shortages and overheads from building costs. ""If we can reduce our agency costs, particularly on locum doctors, we spend a lot on agency nurses to try to keep a lot of our services going... there is probably somewhere in the region of about Â£15m we can save there."" She said part of the plan to create 10 hub hospitals switching services from others was to reduce costs because some facilities were only a few miles apart. And she said the organisation was looking to cast its net wider to find trainees at universities in the north west of England as well as Cardiff. Dr Banfield said: ""We believe that Wales can train its way out of shortages with staff."" A total of 10-weeks of public consultation begins in August.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Charity's 'concern' at number of beavers culled in Scotland,"The Scottish Wildlife Trust said the impact of the cull, estimated at about a fifth of the beaver population, could be ""quite significant"". But Scottish Natural Heritage, which issues the licences, said it was ""not really having any detrimental impact"". Beavers gained protected status in May last year. Killing them or removing their dams can only be done under licence to prevent serious damage to agriculture. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said the licences had been restricted to a ""fairly small proportion of occupied territories in and around Tayside"". A new report showed that 87 beavers were shot and 83 beaver dams were removed between May and December last year. Farming leaders have raised concerns about the damage caused to agricultural land from beavers' dam-building. SNH said it was considering opportunities to move beavers from ""high to low conflict areas within existing catchments"" to improve the resilience of the existing population. Its head of wildlife management, Robbie Kernahan, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We've seen beavers expand their range by about 20% on an annual basis prior to even being protected. ""I think we can be comfortable this level of offtake is sustainable and it's not really having any detrimental impact."" The two main beaver populations are in Knapdale in Argyll, and in Tayside and Forth. The animals were introduced into Knapdale as part of a licensed trial in 2009. In Tayside, beavers were first recorded in the wild in 2006, most likely through escapes from captive collections or after being released illegally. 'Heavy culling' Scottish Wildlife Trust conservation director Sarah Robinson said the report revealed ""alarming figures."" She said: ""The trust see that as deeply concerning, because it's such a substantial proportion of the beaver population on Tayside. ""We know there's still a relatively small number of beavers and they're quite localised. ""So the impact of the cull on this protected species could be quite significant, and of course any continued heavy culling would put the future of the species in Scotland at risk."" Ms Robinson welcomed the recommendation to move beavers within their existing range. She said: ""There would be a particular benefit in moving animals into the fringes of this range in the Tay and the Forth catchments. ""Doing this could help expand their range, and close the gap between Scotland's two beaver populations.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish government funding for youth unemployment priority areas,"The Scottish government has announced the priority areas set to benefit from its youth employment strategy fund. Glasgow, Renfrewshire, North and South Lanarkshire and North and East Ayrshire will be given the extra funding to help boost job chances in their areas. The individual councils will have flexibility on how the cash is spent. Youth Employment Minister Angela Constance said: ""The councils in question have a number of options open to them on how best to direct this funding, but we all have the same objective - improving employment opportunities, and therefore life chances, of Scotland's young people. ""We are also looking towards the Westminster government to deliver a budget for jobs, including a National Insurance holiday for employers who recruit young people. ""This is a relatively simple measure that could significantly enhance employment opportunities for young people."" Local Government Minister Derek Mackay added: ""On top of ensuring 25,000 modern apprenticeship opportunities in every year of this parliament, we have already rolled out several tranches of the youth employment strategy fund since December towards schemes linked to the voluntary sector and young carers. ""Local authorities have a key role in meeting a national challenge and I am confident this funding will make a real difference to the future prospects of young people in these areas."" Glasgow will receive the largest cut of the funds, with almost Â£3.4m going to Scotland's biggest local authority. Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson said: ""Any additional money for Glasgow is very welcome and goodness knows we need it, but this must be part of a proper strategy across Scotland to tackle youth unemployment, rather than handed out as part of a media campaign. ""It's not just about the money - it is about how effectively it is spent."" North Lanarkshire will get Â£1,825,000 while South Lanarkshire will receive Â£1,457,000. North Ayrshire will get Â£828,000, East Ayrshire is to receive Â£720,000 and Renfrewshire will get Â£799,000. Scottish Labour's youth unemployment spokeswoman Kezia Dugdale said: ""It will be interesting to see if this money is being used as a headline grabbing give-away just days before the council elections start, or whether it is a strategic and sustainable investment in the lives of young people who desperately need their government to act.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Read all about it: The online newspaper archive,"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The British Library's newspaper archive at Colindale in north London has long been a place of pilgrimage for writers and historians wanting to search through its extraordinary collection of just about every paper printed in the UK over the last 300 years. But even if you make the trek, finding your way to that particular article in the Ayrshire Post or the Wigan Observer can be a challenge. Now, though, you won't need to make the trip, which in any case is being moved to a new home; you will be able to search it online. The British Newspaper Archive website is one of the most ambitious digital projects undertaken by a museum. In a room high up in the library, giant scanning machines have been capturing the contents of papers from across the UK. The project will last another 10 years and involves scanning 40 million pages. The British Library has teamed up with Brightsolid, a technology firm which specialises in family history. The process, which will involve substantial investment, is run on commercial lines, and users will have to pay a subscription if they want to view the digital archive and download items. For now most of what's on offer dates back to the 19th Century, partly because scanning more recent newspapers involves all sorts of copyright issues: some of the papers would rather keep control of their own archives. But it looks likely to become an extraordinary resource for anyone interested in knowing a bit more about their family background, or as a way of exploring history through the eyes of the reporters of the time. On a quick tour, I got some feeling of the scale of the project. Walking along the miles of shelves you come across all kinds of treasures: from accounts of the Battle of Waterloo to rare 1920s football programmes; from the great affairs of state to the dog show held at my local pub in 1896. Now, if you master the arcane art of searching the site, all this can be yours - for a price, of course. What really comes across is the sheer depth of information buried in the archives of our regional press. And that raises a question. With local newspapers getting thinner or closing every week, what picture of our communities in the 21st Century will be left for future researchers?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Apostrophe ban on Devon council's new street names,"Mid Devon District Council said its new streets had not contained apostrophes for many years, but the policy was now being made official. It said apostrophes could only be found in three street names in the district. It added that Beck's Square and Blundell's Avenue, both in Tiverton, and St George's Well in Cullompton, were ""all named many, many years ago"". Andrew Lacey, from the council, said there was ""no national guidance that stops apostrophes being used"". But proofreader Mary de Vere Taylor from Ashburton said the thought of apostrophes being removed made her ""shudder"". ""It's almost as though somebody with a giant eraser is literally trying to erase punctuation from our consciousness,"" she told BBC News. She said there was something ""terribly British and terribly reassuring"" about well-written and well-punctuated writing. ""Some may say I should get a life and get out more, but if I got out more and saw place names with no apostrophes where there should be, I shudder to think how I'd react,"" she added. Ms de Vere Taylor said while she accepted language had to evolve, in her opinion the council's decision was a backward step. In Newton Abbot, residents of Bakers Views - named after writer and explorer Sir Samuel White Baker - have differing opinions over whether their street sign should have an apostrophe. ""I think it probably should, if we're being completely correct, because it's named after the chap who funded Baker's Park just down the hill - because it's a view of his park,"" one resident said. But another said: ""I've never thought about it and it doesn't worry me at all."" Devon greengrocer Jim Ashford said although his English grammar was ""not brilliant"", he tries to ensure his fruit and vegetable signs are properly punctuated. ""The apostrophe is part of the English language so I think it should be upheld,"" he said. Steve Jenner, from the Plain English Campaign, said punctuation, including the apostrophe, was one of the basic rules of language and he described the council's decision as ""nonsensical"". A statement from the council said: ""Our proposed policy on street naming and numbering covers a whole host of practical issues, many of which are aimed at reducing potential confusion over street names."" However, it declined to comment further and did not elaborate on who might be confused by the use of correct punctuation.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bill Clinton regrets 'three strikes' bill,"Speaking to a civil rights group, he said: ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it."" It put 100,000 more police officers on the streets but locked up ""minor actors for way too long"", Mr Clinton said. President Barack Obama launched a renewed effort to reform the criminal justice system this week. He visited a federal prison in Oklahoma on Thursday, becoming the first sitting president to do so. Speaking at the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution, Mr Obama said the criminal justice system needs to distinguish between young people who make mistakes and those who are truly dangerous. Some of the young prisoners he met at the prison had made mistakes not that different from those he made in his youth, Mr Obama said. On Wednesday, Mr Clinton told the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) convention in Philadelphia that he had faced a ""roaring decade of rising crime"". He signed a bill into action in 1994 that included a ""three strikes"" rule that meant anyone convicted of a serious violent crime who had two or more prior convictions, including drug crimes, was given a life sentence. He said the ""good news"" was that the tough raft of measures in the bill had helped secure ""the biggest drop in crime history"". ""The bad news is we had a lot of people who were essentially locked up who were minor actors for way too long,"" he added. US prisoners find new struggles after being released Earlier this week, President Obama commuted the prison sentences of 46 drug offenders saying their sentences ""didn't fit their crimes"". ""Mass incarceration makes our entire country worse off, and we need to do something about it,"" Mr Obama told the NAACP on Tuesday. He has urged Congress to pass a sentencing reform bill by the year's end. Mr Clinton's comments come as his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, makes criminal justice reform part of her presidential campaign agenda. In April, Mrs Clinton echoed President Obama's comments, saying she would push for an end to the ""era of mass incarceration"". The last significant changes to the US criminal justice system came in 2013 when US Attorney General Eric Holder dropped mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders. More than two million people are in jail in the US. A tenth of them are held in federal prisons.

Former US intelligence analyst charged with leaks to media,"Daniel Everette Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tennessee, was arrested after allegedly providing at least 17 top secret documents to an unnamed journalist. According to the indictment, the files related to counterterrorism and were published in whole or in part. He is expected to make his first court appearance in Nashville on Thursday. After enlisting with the US Air Force in 2009, Mr Hale went on to work as an analyst with the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), court documents say. In these roles, Mr Hale gained top secret security clearance and had access to classified defence information, according to authorities. In April 2013, court documents allege, while assigned to the NSA, Mr Hale began communicating with the reporter, speaking in person and using encrypted messaging tools. According to prosecutors, in February 2014 Mr Hale printed 36 documents from his ""Top Secret computer"", providing at least 17 to the journalist. The files included a memo outlining a military campaign against al-Qaeda and a top secret intelligence report on an operative for the extremist group, the indictment said. Mr Hale also allegedly had a thumb drive with software recommended by the reporter's online news outlet in an article on how to anonymously leak documents. The indictment details extensive communication between Mr Hale and the journalist, and cites a text message between Mr Hale and a friend saying the reporter ""wants me to tell my story about working with drones"". While the outlet is not named in court documents, it is reported to be the Intercept, an online news publication. In October 2015, the Intercept published ""The Drone Papers"", which used ""a cache of secret documents detailing the inner workings of the US military's assassination program"", that was provided to one of its journalists ""by a whistleblower"". The Intercept has made no comment on Mr Hale's arrest. This would be the third time someone has been charged with leaking sensitive information to the media outlet. Mr Hale is charged under the Espionage Act with five crimes related to stealing and disclosing national defence information. He faces a maximum of 50 years in prison.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Holly Roe: 'Dress rehearsal' days before baby's death,"Holly Roe died from non-accidental injuries, and the prosecution claim she was shaken by her mother Tiffany Tate or father Michael Roe. Mr Roe performed CPR on Holly on the day she died, and prosecutor Sally Howes QC told the court Mr Roe had also resuscitated her six days before. The pair, from East Sussex, deny murder and causing or allowing Holly's death. Rib fractures On 4 September 2018 Holly stopped breathing at the family home in Crowborough, while being looked after by Mr Roe. During Ms Tate's police interview she said Holly was ""barking like a seal"" when she got home, and Mr Roe said ""I think her airways are closing"". He gave Holly mouth to mouth Ms Tate said after that she was ""fine"", so they did not get Holly checked at hospital. Ms Howes said: ""This incident was a dress rehearsal for what happened to that child on 10 September."" On that date Holly stopped breathing again and Mr Roe performed CPR under the direction of a 999 call handler. Holly was taken to hospital in an ambulance but was pronounced dead on arrival. Mr Roe told Ms Tate not to mention the previous not-breathing episode, the court heard. Post-mortem tests found the infant had bleeding and bruising around her brain, bleeding in both her eyes and 12 rib fractures - some suffered up to ten days before her death. During the prosecution opening, Ms Howes told the court that when Holly was born prematurely and in the Special Care Baby Unit Ms Tate did not visit her daily and had to be persuaded to visit at all. She said Ms Tate got ""frustrated"" with her baby and had admitted saying she ""felt like throwing Holly against the wall"". Ms Howes also told jurors Mr Roe would pinch Holly's toe to make her cry with pain so he could get her colic medication into her mouth. Mr Roe was the last person to see Holly alive, the court heard. Ms Howes told the jury that while most of the evidence suggests he shook and killed Holly, there is also evidence implicating Ms Tate. The trial continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Army morale declining, Ministry of Defence survey shows","Thirty per cent of army personnel described their morale as low - up from 26% last year - the report showed. And the proportion of those rating their morale as high dropped for the third year running to 40%. Labour said the government's ""broken promises"" on armed forces spending were to blame for the weakened morale. Of the three armed services, the Army has been the hardest hit by recent redundancies. The government has announced plans to cut the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2017. It also aims to increase the number of reservists from the 2010 figure of 15,000, to 30,000 in 2018. 'Under-valued' But the survey showed that just 32% of army personnel believe that reservists are well integrated with regular forces. The equivalent figure was higher for the Royal Navy, at 56%, while for the Royal Air Force it was 64%. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said it appeared that regular troops were yet to be convinced that filling their ranks with part-time soldiers would really work. Despite the drop in army morale, figures for the three forces combined showed 49% of personnel were satisfied with service life in general, while 28% said they were dissatisfied - largely unchanged from the previous year. There was an increase in the proportion of personnel describing their workload as ""too high"" - from 40% to 44%. Just 7% said it was ""too low"". Shadow armed forces minister Kevan Jones said: ""A record of redundancies, cuts to equipment and slashed allowances means our forces feel under-valued and under-powered. ""Due to a failed economic strategy, ministers have repeatedly returned to the services to make cuts, which may harm our ability to project force in the world."" Of the 4,480 army personnel who were made redundant in June, 3,765, or 84%, volunteered for redundancy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said at the time. Job cuts have already reduced staffing at the air force from 40,000 to 35,000, and at the navy from 35,000 to 30,000.

Fishing boat discards 'hard to comply with',"Boats having to land unwanted fish caught in their nets started being phased in at the start of the year, under European laws. Throwing dead fish back into the sea had increased due to strict EU quotas on which fish could be landed in a bid to conserve stocks. The University of Strathclyde said it would pose the industry problems. The ban is part of a new deal on fishing quotas and industry rules that was reached after negotiations in Brussels. The ban came into force in January for species such as herring and mackerel, and will take effect a year later for cod and haddock. The Strathclyde study concluded reducing waste and improving fish stocks was uncertain. 'Legacy of overfishing' Prof Mike Heath, who led the research, said: ""The campaign to change the CFP (Common Fisheries Policy) and get the discard ban onto the statute book was based on the assertion that half of all fish caught are discarded, and that EU quota restrictions are to blame. ""But our comprehensive assessment of discarding in the North Sea shows that's not the case. ""The wasteful practice of over-quota discarding has to be stopped but our study shows that the fundamental reason for the increasing proportion of catch being discarded is that the stocks have become more dominated by undersized fish. ""This is a legacy of overfishing in the past."" Dr Robin Cook, who also took part in the research, said: ""The discard ban will force skippers to use up the storage capacity aboard their vessels bringing ashore fish for which there is no significant market. ""This will have a detrimental effect on the profitability of the fishing industry, with no real benefit to the stocks. Further improvements in the performance of fishing gears are needed to overcome this, so that small fish are no longer caught."" 'Takes time' A spokesman for the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF), said: ""No-one hates discarding more than our fishermen, but this study simply confirms what we already knew - the impending introduction of a discard ban has potentially devastating consequences for our fishing communities if implemented badly. ""The independent science shows that the majority of fish stocks are recovering and part of this recovery can be attributed to our fishermen using increasingly selective fishing gears - work which is ongoing. ""However, all this takes time, and it is essential that the discard ban is introduced on a gradual basis and with a large degree of flexibility in its operation.""

Technology companies must protect children online,"They were debating a report published in March by the Lords Communications Committee. The report, Growing up With the Internet, looked at the issues and opportunities faced by children online. Government spokeswoman Baroness Chisholm agreed technology companies had ""a responsibility"" to their users. Lord Best, who chaired the committee when the report was published, told peers: ""As things stand, the government's approach is positive but does depend on this mighty industry putting its own house in order. ""I do sense a pervasive uneasiness that the internet providers and the huge tech companies, the Googles, Facebooks and the rest, may never do as much as they should without more strenuous government intervention."" The Bishop of Chelmsford, the Right Reverend Stephen Cottrell, said: ""It is simply no good for Facebook and others to shrug their shoulders and say they are just a platform upon which others stand and they can't take responsibility for content and the consequences of that content. ""Because if they wished, or if we made them, they could be a ticket-inspector of that platform, offering proper control and management of content."" He added: ""Self-regulation does not work. Commercial interest always outflanks care of the child. This must change and government must take a lead.""

The Digital Economy Act of this year also provides a code of practice setting out guidance for social-media providers in relation to conduct on their platforms. Speaking ahead of the debate, Lord Best said that while the government should be ""congratulated"" on its new Internet Safety Strategy, ""if the tech industry - particularly the internet service providers like Google and Facebook - do not adopt and implement a robust code of practise, the government must legislate to enforce this"".

Libya civil war: UN envoy SalamÃ© says foreign intervention must end,"On the eve of peace talks in Berlin, Mr SalamÃ© said foreign support of proxy groups in the conflict had created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence. But Mr SalamÃ© told the BBC that he was optimistic about the negotiations. It comes after nine months of conflict between the powerful General Khalifa Haftar and the UN-backed government in the capital Tripoli. A truce was announced earlier this month between Gen Haftar and the Government of National Accord (GNA). But both sides blame each other for reported breaches of the agreement, and attempts to broker a lasting ceasefire broke down last week at a summit in Moscow. On Saturday, forces loyal to Gen Haftar blocked oil exports from several major Libyan ports. The move is a damaging blow to the country's main source of income, a day before renewed peace talks begin. What did Ghassan SalamÃ© say? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr SalamÃ© called on international powers to stop supporting local proxy groups with mercenaries, arms, financing, and direct military support. He said such actions created ""a vicious circle where their proxies call for intervention in their fight, and their own ambitions bring more divisions."" The role of foreign states in the conflict has come into focus in recent months, with Turkey passing a controversial law to deploy troops to help GNA forces in Tripoli. Meanwhile, Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has the backing of Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan. Sunday's summit aims to extract a pledge from foreign powers to honour a UN arms embargo on Libya, and to halt any further interference in the conflict. The meeting will bring the two sides together, along with their foreign backers, the UN and other global powers, including Russia's President Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr SalamÃ© told the BBC that a political solution to the conflict was best for all parties involved because Libya - with its vast geography, strong local identities, heavily-armed population and weakened government infrastructure - was a difficult country for one group to control. ""Most of the national interests of all these countries, especially big [commercial] contracts and oil contracts, even geopolitical demands, can be accommodated by a peaceful and prosperous Libya, much better than a divided and war-torn country,"" he added. What is the current situation in Libya? Libya has been wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising which ousted long-time strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Gen Haftar's LNA controls much of eastern Libya, and last April he launched an offensive against the country's rival government in Tripoli. His forces have so far been unable to take the city, but earlier this month the LNA captured Libya's country's third-biggest city, Sirte. According to the UN, the fighting has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more from their homes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sri Lanka met Ban ki Moon panel,"The meeting in New York was not announced to the media by either the UNSG or the Sri Lankan government. ""The panel members took part in a discussion along with an officer named Lynn Pascoe (United States as Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs), where Attorney General and the secretary to the ministry of External Affairs represented Sri Lanka"" the Minister told BBC Sandeshaya. Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Secretary to External Affairs Ministry at the time Romesh Jayasinghe, Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative at the United Nations Palitha Kohona and his deputy, Major General Shavendra de Silva meeting the panel in February was first revealed by the Sunday Times published in Colombo. Progress Minister Peiris said that the Sri Lanka delegation informed of the progress of the work carried out by the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) and other measures of reconciliation. The delegation had discussions with General Secretary Ban Ki Moon prior to meeting the panel. UN panel appointed by the Secretary General is chaired by Marzuki Darusman (Indonesia). Yasmin Sooka (South Africa) and Steven Ratner (United States) are the two other members of the panel. Investment opportunities Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, Minister Peiris said that he is in Europe to promote the investment opportunities in Sri Lanka and to counter false propaganda against the country. He said that it is important to look at the situation in an objective manner. A recent delegation from European parliament who had visited the North had commented the image they had a bout post war Sri Lanka was false. ""the bleak picture which had been painted in the west does not correspond with reality on the ground"", The minister said quoting the European delegation. International probe The minister also admitted that there are around three thousand suspected Tamil Tigers still in custody without being charged. Replying to a question on the comments made by Robert O. Blake, Jr. United States Assistant Secretary, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Minister GL Peiris said the US government had not threatened to establish an accountability mechanism on alleged human rights violations. On the 14th of March, speaking in New York Robert Blake said that his government will be seeking accountability. ""Our strong preference is that the Sri Lankan government establish its own transparent process that meets international standards. However, in the absence of such a mechanism, there will be mounting pressure for an international mechanism"" Robert Blake remarked at an Asia Society event in New York.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Halton Transport: Bus company with huge losses goes into liquidation,"Halton Transport, which runs more than a third of services across the Cheshire borough, lost almost Â£620,000 in 2019, up from Â£50,500 in 2017. Halton Borough Council said it tried to give the firm a ""stronger, more sustainable footing"" but had failed. It said the ""simple advice"" to people who rely on Halton Transport services was to ""make alternative arrangements"". The move, which has put 150 jobs at risk, came after the company had to be bailed out with a Â£750,000 loan from the council in 2019, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. A council spokeswoman said the authority was working with other bus providers to ensure essential services are maintained but added that there would be ""inevitably be disruption"". Passenger watchdog Transport Focus said it was ""vital"" local authorities and bus operators reduced the immediate impact on passengers. 'Difficult choices' Arriva North West announced on its website that it would take over some of the firm's routes, while Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said all Merseytravel-funded school routes would continue to run. The firm has been run as an ""arm's length"" company by the council since 1986, when the introduction of the Transport Act made it illegal for councils to directly run bus companies. Halton Council, which faces a Â£6m funding gap in 2020, said a ""difficult"" trading environment and council budget cuts had led to the firm's demise. ""As the major shareholder, the council has been supporting the company in an attempt to place it on a stronger, more sustainable footing [but] unfortunately that has not been possible,"" the spokeswoman said. She said the council had had ""significant reductions in its budget"" and had to make ""difficult choices"" going forward, meaning that its ""ability to support a commercial operation like Halton Transport is limited"". She added that the ""simple advice to members of the public is that if you rely on a Halton Transport bus, you should make alternative arrangements"". ""The council would like to apologise to bus users for any inconvenience caused and will continue to try to arrange alternative services."" 'Not unexpected' Mr Rotheram said he had ""taken immediate action"" to ensure the school services would continue to run from Monday morning, using Arriva North West and Stagecoach buses. He added that while the Transport Act had ""legally prevented"" the combined authority from buying Halton Transport, his aim was to ""minimise the impact for local people as much as possible"". John Boughton, regional officer for the union Unite, said it was ""a very sad state of affairs, but not unexpected"" as it had ""been on the cards for some time"". ""Other bus operators will be taking over services and we understand that they are actively recruiting drivers previously employed by Halton Transport,"" he added. Transport Focus director David Sidebottom said buses were the ""only real means of transport available to many people"", so it was important that authorities and bus operators worked out ""a longer term plan to provide services that local residents demand"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Will you be lonely this Christmas?,"Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Nights spent at parties and catching up with friends, culminating with a Christmas surrounded by family. But the festive period is not like that for everyone. Age UK estimates about 450,000 will be spending this Christmas alone. A combination of the ageing population and the fact families are dispersed across the country - and abroad for that matter - means it is not always easy to get together. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, says it is a ""chilling"" thought, which combined with the shorter days and poorer weather, results in the festive period being one of the most vulnerable times of year for the frailest in society. But, sadly, the problem is not just confined to Christmas. Research for the Campaign to End Loneliness shows that more than half of over 75s now live alone with many saying that television is their main source of company. One in 10 report only having contact with family, friends and neighbours once a month. It equates to over 800,000 people in England being classified as ""chronically lonely"". Kate Jopling, director of the Campaign to End Loneliness, says the situation is ""shocking"" and desperately needs to be addressed. She says research has shown showing that loneliness can have significant impact on health - both mentally and physically - with one study even suggesting that it was ""as damaging to our health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day"". To be fair, the government and NHS has recognised there is a problem that needs addressing. A Winter Friends campaign has just been launched appealing for a return to an ""old-fashioned sense of neighbourliness"" by encouraging people to check on elderly friends and neighbours over the winter months. The aim is to get 100,000 signed up to free alerts that reminds them when bad weather is forecast and gives them tips on how they can help. These include: Meanwhile, a 24-hour phone service - Silver Line - has also been launched with Lottery money to offer the over 75s friendship, information and advice. These initiatives will no doubt help. But with the social care system under such strain (councils are cutting back on the home help they provide) not to mention the concern over the cost of energy, it promises to be a tough few months for many.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Government sets out Â£1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions,"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst It wants firms to waste less energy, develop low-carbon technologies and invest in equipment that can store carbon emissions in rocks underground. It's set out details of a previously-announced Â£1bn fund to help industrial buildings, schools and hospitals get better insulation and conserve energy. Opposition parties said the policy lacked urgency and ambition. However, the clarity of the strategy has been welcomed by industry groups. They say it will help to guide investment choices. The CBI said it was a vital step in the UK's commitment to cutting out almost all carbon emissions by 2050. Ministers have given details of support for nine green technology projects in Scotland, South Wales, the North West, Humber and Teesside. Studies will be funded to design a low-carbon infrastructure using hydrogen and carbon capture, which strips emissions from industrial exhausts. To reduce carbon emissions from public buildings including hospitals, schools and council buildings, Â£932m has been directed to 429 projects across England. This will fund low-carbon heating systems, such as heat pumps, and energy efficiency measures like insulation and LED lighting. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""We're taking steps to be the first major economy to have its own low-carbon industrial sector. ""While reaching our climate targets will require extensive change across our economy, we must do so in a way that protects jobs, creates new industries and attracts inward investment - without pushing emissions and business abroad."" The plan proposes a penalty price on carbon emissions to nudge firms towards clean alternatives. And there's talk of halting emissions from the steel industry by 2035. But opposition parties and environmentalists say the government should go much further by funding a multi-billion pound transition to clean steel - in the way competitor nations such as Germany have done. ""Questions still remain around the pace of change in the steel sector,"" Jonathan Marshall from the Energy and Climate Information Unit told the BBC. ""The global race towards clean steel production is well under way and the UK is behind the pack. Increased ambition in the short term can help to lock in high-skilled, high-paid jobs for decades, preserving Britain's proud steelmaking history for generations."" Green MP Caroline Lucas said the UK needed a Â£40bn investment every year in green infrastructure to create more than one million jobs - with an emergency plan for training and apprenticeships. But the CBI's Rain Newton-Smith said: ""The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy marks a vital step in the UK's plans to achieve its net-zero emissions target. ""This is a welcome demonstration of the UK's commitment to act on climate change, to make our post-pandemic recovery a green one, and to give businesses the certainty they need to invest in the technologies of the future.""

Are we stuck with plastic drinking straws?,"By Louise GreenwoodBusiness reporter John Sidanta, chief executive of Primaplast, said he was aware of rising global concern over levels of plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. But he said affordable alternatives had yet to be developed. At the moment, greener straws cost a hundred times more, he said. Primaplast manufactures up to 600 million polypropylene plastic straws a month from its base in Tangerang, Indonesia, for markets in Europe and Japan, where they are sold alongside cartons of juice, milkshakes and yoghurt drinks. Despite a useful life of just minutes, traditional plastic straws cannot degrade once disposed of and Mr Sidanta acknowledges their days are probably numbered. Some firms are already beginning to curb their use. The pub chain JD Wetherspoon and Pizza Express have announced plans to phase them out completely, while other firms, such as All Bar One, say they plan to substantially reduce the availability of plastic straws in their branches. Cornwall may become the first county to ban them from bars and restaurants after a campaign by the group Final Straw Cornwall. The market for multi-use designer straws made of bamboo, metal or glass, that can retail for several pounds each is growing. But paper alternatives have had a mixed response as they tend to go soggy easily, making them harder to use - particularly for children. Straws can also be made from potato or corn paste, but Mr Sidarta said it has been expensive to develop products from those materials. ""To be as close as possible to plastic materials, this is not an easy job."" Mr Sidarta points that carton drinks can last up to 18 months, but straws made from alternative materials that could last that long would cost Primaplast up to a hundred times more to manufacture. Lightweight Mr Sidanta adds that polypropylene straws are in fact ""definitely recyclable"", and in Japan are often reused in other forms of packaging, plastic tiles and even for types of stationery. In other markets this often isn't done as the lightweight nature of these straws mean that, like banknotes, a huge volume is needed before recycling becomes cost effective. He believes governments worldwide must decide on clear legislation for the global use of plastic materials in food and drinks and other consumer goods and warns a boycott won't work. ""We have to be rationalâ¦ it's not reasonable enough to say 'stop using the products' without a solution,"" he said. ""This is not just about strawsâ¦ for mainstream restaurants and food outlets, this is all single-use disposable products. ""We have been looking for the past fifteen years at replacing... polypropylene. We found the materials but the pricing isn't good enough. It's a stuck situation. There is no reasonable substitution by far.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Catholic priest jailed for nine years for child sex abuse,"Father Paul Moore, 82, committed the crimes in various locations in Ayrshire between 1977 and 1996. The court heard how he abused one boy at a school, another at a leisure centre and a third on the beach at Irvine in the 1970s. He was also found guilty of indecently assaulting a student priest in 1995. The judge Lady Rae told Moore he was guilty of despicable crimes and a gross breach of trust. She also said the victims had shown considerable courage in coming forward. The youngest was just five when the priest abused him in his primary school. The court heard that the priest groomed some of his victims by taking them swimming or out for meals before sexually abusing them. A BBC Scotland investigation revealed five years ago that Moore confessed his abuse to his bishop in 1996. Bishop Maurice Taylor, 91, gave evidence in the trial and told the court Moore admitted he had ""an attraction to young boys"" and had ""a desire to abuse minors"". The bishop sent him to a treatment centre in Toronto and to Fort Augustus Abbey in the Highlands. Moore was removed from the pastoral ministry after his admission but continued to live in a house purchased by the church. The priest, who was identified in court as Francis Moore but was known as Father Paul, was found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. The Catholic Church in Scotland said it wished to ""sincerely renew"" its apologies to victims. Bishop William Nolan, the Bishop of Galloway said: ""All allegations of abuse are taken seriously and are reported to the police. It is hoped that publicity from a case like this will encourage survivors to come forward knowing that they will be heard and that justice can be achieved. ""I hope that the sentencing of the individual responsible will bring some comfort to those who have suffered, although it can never undo the harm they have experienced or the long wait for justice they have had to endure. ""I sincerely renew the apologies previously made for the abuse suffered by anyone in the care of those ministering or working on behalf of the Church. ""We aspire to the highest standards of care and protection, and are committed to rebuilding trust and confidence in the ways in which we ensure that children, young people and vulnerable adults are kept safe."" 'Bravery of victims' The Crown Office praised the courage of Moore's victims in coming forward. Kenny Donnelly, procurator fiscal for sexual offences, said: ""The actions of Francis Moore have had a devastating impact on the lives of his vulnerable victims. ""He was trusted and respected by the community he served while all along he was abusing his position of trust. ""Thanks to the bravery of his victims in coming forward to report what happened to them, he is now paying the consequences for his actions.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Italian runner braves Siberia big chill,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring The Russian and Italian media have followed the odyssey of Paolo Venturini avidly, from the initial stranding of his vehicle in the extreme cold to his triumph in crossing the finishing line. As one of the contenders for the title of Northern Pole of Cold, he covered 39km (24 miles) in just under four hours, from Tomtor in eastern Siberia to the neighbouring village of Oymyakon. The local Met Office recorded a temperature of -67.7 there in 1933, and the thermometer regularly dips below -60. 'A grand scale' Mr Venturini, an officer in Padua, is an extreme-sports enthusiast and member of his local Golden Flame police sports team. Just before setting off from Tomtor, he said ""we have to live our lives on a grand scale, because we will never get the same chance again,"" Corriere della Sera newspaper reports. In 2017 he ran 75km through the Lut desert of Iran, where temperatures hit the other end of the scale at 67 degrees. He has spent nearly two years preparing for the Siberian challenge. He designed special clothing, trained inside an industrial freezer, and travelled with a support team including medics and film-makers who plan a documentary about his Monster Frozen project, which has the backing of the Russian and Italian authorities You might also be interested in: Paolo Venturini's achievement may have captured the headlines around the world, but another runner from Moldova actually set a new local record by running further and in even more daunting conditions along the same route a few days earlier. Dmitry Voloshin ran 50km (31 miles) at temperatures getting down to -60 Celsius, or -67 with the wind-chill factor, according to the news service of Siberia's Sakha Republic. 'Into the cosmos' Mr Voloshin, an experienced runner who was raising money for his Unfrozen cerebral palsy charity back home, told Ria Novosti that it was ""the toughest experience of my sporting career"". He noted in particular how hard it was to breathe: ""It was like stepping out into the cosmos."" The head of Tomtor council, Yekaterina Vinokurova, told RIA that Mr Voloshin had ""set a record by covering the distance in six hours in ultra-low temperatures"". Next year is the centenary of the founding of Oymyakon village, and local officials told RIA Novosti news agency that they want to build on the international attention the two recent runs have brought them. They plan to host a full-scale international ice marathon, which means contestants will have to run a 40km course, and are applying to the Russian government for the necessary funding.

Channel Islands Air Search: Reserve fuel error blamed for crash,"The Islander aircraft, with five crew, was involved in a search for two fishermen when it crash-landed on Jersey's north east coast. All five walked away unharmed after the incident on 3 November and the fishermen were later rescued. The initial report found the right and then left engine cut out as their fuel ran out 15 minutes into the flight. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch discovered the cockpit controls which select the fuel supply for the engines were set for it to run off the reserve, or tip, tanks rather than the main fuel tanks. The report established that the tip tanks were empty having not been refilled from a 50-minute search carried out the previous day, while the main fuel tanks were almost full. 'Not noticed' It also noted a lack of detail in the fuel checks that ""simply established that the main tank quantities were sufficient"" and the ""absence of a change in the main tank quantities, and the reducing quantities in the tip tanks, were not noticed"". The report said the area where the plane landed was ""one of the very few relatively benign areas suitable for a forced landing"" among the ""rocky cliffs"" of Jersey's north coast. The landing caused ""significant damage to wing, left main landing gear and forward fuselage"". John Hardie, 65, was the pilot of the plane that left Guernsey Airport to join the search that involved Channel Islands, French and English Coastguards. Colin Ferbrache, chief officer of Channel Islands Air Search, described him as ""an extremely experienced pilot with a distinguished service and commercial career... amassing some 22,000 flying hours. Confusing controls ""His record during his career has been hitherto unblemished. ""When faced with a sudden total loss of engine power, he displayed superb airmanship and calmly carried out a remarkable forced landing under appalling conditions resulting in no injury to him or his four crew."" He said ""awful flying conditions"" including high winds and heavy rain showers, ""confusing"" controls for switching between tanks and there being ""little to alert the pilot that tip tanks were selected"" all contributed to the crash. Mr Ferbrache said this was a known issue and the control system for the tanks was ""very different"" in later built Islanders and Trislanders. The plane, which was built in 1982, has been dismantled and is being taken to Scotland for repairs. The search charity said it hoped a replacement Islander would be used in the meantime to continue the service, which was currently being helped by the Barclay Brothers' helicopter based on Brecqhou.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour MP quits party review group over leadership disagreement,"By Ellie PriceBBC News Alison McGovern told the BBC the shadow chancellor had suggested the group she chairs, Progress, co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers. John McDonnell also accused Progress of having a ""hard-right agenda"", Ms McGovern said. Labour said the review she said she was quitting had not yet been launched. 'Backed into corner' Ms McGovern's resignation comes after junior shadow ministers Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty, and Kevan Jones quit on Wednesday in protest at Labour's reshuffle this week. The resignation of Mr Doughty on BBC Two's Daily Politics led to an official complaint from Labour, who accused the BBC of orchestrating the resignation for maximum ""political impact"" - something the BBC denies. Ms McGovern, the Wirral South MP, said Mr McDonnell had asked her to take part in the Labour's policy review on child poverty and combating inequality. The pair were due to meet for the second time to discuss the subject on Wednesday, but Ms McGovern claims Mr McDonnell was late because he was making media appearances. She told BBC's Sunday Politics: ""So I'm there waiting to meet him to talk about it and all the while he'd gone to the TV studio to call the organisation that I am chair of 'hard-right Conservative', of having a hard-right Conservative agenda. That's not OK."" ""We are all Labour members and we believe in having a Labour government - that's what we are, nothing more nothing less. ""And, as I say, I don't want to be on the telly talking about this but I have been backed into a corner and I have got no other choice now but to stand up and say 'this is who we are' and we should just get on with the business of getting a Labour government."" Progress is broadly seen as the Blairite wing of the party. On Wednesday Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine programme: ""We've had a few junior members resign today and of course that's their right. ""But they do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party based around the organisation Progress. ""I don't believe they have ever accepted Jeremy's mandate.""

Zhao Ziyang: Purged Chinese Communist reformer is buried,"The remains of Mr Zhao, who died in 2005, were interred along with those of his wife in a quiet ceremony. Mr Zhao was ousted as general secretary of the Communist Party in 1989 and lived under house arrest until he died. The crackdown authorised by officials killed hundreds, and has been excised from Chinese history books. Negotiations about what to do with the ashes of a man the authorities have also tried to write out of history have gone on for years. Only close family were allowed to attend the low-key burial in Tianshou Garden cemetery in Chaoping in Beijing's northern outskirts. Well-wishers and supporters were kept away. ""Today we are burying our parents with family ceremonies. The small ceremony is held in the atmosphere of family peace,"" Mr Zhao's daughter Wang Yannan told BBC Chinese. She also apologised for not publicly announcing the burial before it went ahead, saying the family were unsure if they would get the green light from authorities until the last minute. Zhao Ziyang was promoted by China's former supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, who was looking for someone to reform the economy and open up the country to the outside world. His position seemed assured when he was made general secretary of the ruling Communist Party in 1987. But the protests by students and residents in Beijing - and elsewhere across China - two years later revealed deep divisions within the party leadership. Hundreds of thousands called for democratic reforms in a peaceful demonstration largely focused on a gathering in Tiananmen Square. Mr Zhao, who had a more liberal attitude than other leaders, favoured a conciliatory approach towards the protesters. That view eventually lost to those who wanted to bring in the army, and Mr Deng approved the detention of his former favourite. The end of a long wait Analysis by Vivian Wu, BBC Chinese The burial of Zhao Ziyang - once China's top official - has been a contentious issue. Usually, Chinese state leaders' burials are extravagant affairs, complete with media fanfare. But when Mr Zhao died in 2005, it was announced that his cremation would be held in a conventional cemetery, designated for state leaders, high ranking-officials and celebrities tolerated by the authorities. Then, officials refused permission for his ashes to be buried, and the family took his ashes home. He also went without the usual speeches and editorials which celebrate deceased Chinese leaders' major anniversaries. The authorities had categorised him as a ""toppled former leader"" whose anniversaries are smothered in deliberate silence and tightened security. Mr Zhao's family did not accept this arrangement and now, after years of patience, they have been allowed to bury their parents together. His grave will naturally become a memorial site for the public as he has become an icon for the sacrifice of personal well-being for democracy, despite the red line marked by the authorities on any commemoration of 4 June-related events or people.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool,"A third of GP surgeries have been told to contact people who may have been given an inaccurate assessment of their future risk of heart disease. The alert follows the discovery of a problem with a digital calculator for assessing heart risk and the need to prescribe cholesterol-lowering drugs. The medicines regulator said the clinical risk to patients was low. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has launched an investigation. ""We are working closely with the company responsible for the software to establish the problem and address any issues identified,"" said a spokesperson. ""Clinical advice is that the risk to patients is low and only a limited number of patients are potentially affected. ""GPs have been informed and they will contact individual patients should any further action be necessary."" Incorrect results The MHRA said the issue had resulted in incorrect results being produced for a proportion of patients. For the affected patients, the potential risk of cardiovascular disease could have been under or overstated, it said. The computer tool is used to help GPs assess the potential risk of cardiovascular disease in patients. GPs type in details including the patient's age, body mass index, whether they smoke and other health conditions, and the system calculates a percentage score stating their risk of having a heart attack in a decade. The IT company that makes the software, TPP, said it was working with the MHRA to ensure that clinicians were informed of any patients that may have been affected as soon as possible. ""TPP is dealing with the issue involving the QRISK2 Calculator in SystmOne,"" TPP said in a statement. ""The tool is intended to support GPs in assessing patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease and in developing treatment plans."" The Royal College of GPs said the decision to prescribe statins to patients is never taken lightly and those who are prescribed them will undertake regular medication reviews. ""We would advise our patients who take statins, and those who have cardiovascular problems but don't, not to panic as a result of this news,"" said Dr Imran Rafi. ""But if they are concerned they should make a non-urgent appointment with their GP to discuss this.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Frustration as garden centres in Wales stay closed,"Centres were among non-essential firms told to close before Christmas amid concerns over the new Covid-19 variant. Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff said gardening helped people's mental and physical health, adding it had ""first class"" safety measures in place. But the Welsh Government said the Covid-19 situation was ""very serious"". Garden centres were among the first businesses to be allowed to reopen last May as restrictions began to be eased following the first national lockdown in March. As cases started to increase across the UK in the autumn, Wales went into a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown at the end of October, which meant non-essential businesses including garden centres had to shut. They were allowed to reopen after this period ended, but First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Wales was going into an alert level four lockdown before Christmas. On Wednesday, England joined other nations of the UK in going into a national lockdown - but garden centres are allowed to remain open because the UK government considers them essential. Nicola Pugh, senior operations manager at Pugh's, which has centres in Wenvoe and Radyr, said businesses were ""frustrated"" at the disparity between Wales and England. ""In last year's initial lockdown, based on science, garden centres in Wales were given permission to open their doors before other retailers, for the mental and physical health benefits of gardening,"" she said. ""Gardening keeps people at home, with in excess of three million new gardeners taking up the hobby since lockdown, whether it be in their outside space, window sills, balconies or living rooms with house plants."" Ms Pugh said their centres had offered ""first class social distancing and a safe shopping environment with large outdoor expanses"". Unlike during the first lockdown, Welsh Government guidelines state non-essential businesses can continue to offer click and collect services, which allow people to pay online and collect from a store. But Ms Pugh said it was not ""logistically or financially feasible"" to set such a service up. The Horticultural Trade Association, which represents garden centres, has previously called on the Welsh Government to keep them open. James Clark, its director of policy, said: ""There is no evidence whatsoever that garden centres are Covid transmission risks. ""The Welsh Government should take a more tailored, rather than blanket approach to what premises to close."" A Welsh Government spokesman said alert level four restrictions were in place to reduce the spread of the virus. ""We have all made huge sacrifices over the last year, but we all need to continue to work together and follow the rules to keep Wales safe,"" he said. ""The situation in Wales is very serious with a new high-infection strain of the virus circulating. The restrictions are kept under review but changes will only be made when it is safe to do so.""

Arizona wildfire: Battling the blaze,"The interagency ""hotshot"" team - of which there are a number across the US - are highly trained and equipped to work in remote areas at ground level for long periods with little support. Under heavy protective clothing, their main task is to create a firebreak between people and the fires by removing brush, trees and anything that might burn in the direction of homes and cities. To achieve this they carry a range of equipment. Hotshot firefighter kit Source: National Interagency Fire Center Fire shelters Art Morrison, of the Arizona State Forestry Commission, told CNN the hotshot crew in Arizona was ""digging a fire line"" - removing fuel from the path of a wildfire - when the fire overtook them. The team - without anywhere to escape - was forced to deploy emergency shelters, intended to shield them from the fast-moving flames, he explained. The shelters - made of a fire-resistant material - are regarded as the last line of defence for a firefighter against advancing flames. Firefighters are advised to dig a hole and climb into it inside the protective tent, allowing the fire to pass over them. However, Dan Fraijo, fire chief in the Arizona city of Prescott, said there was only a ""50% chance"" of survival. About 200 firefighters are continuing to fight the Arizona wildfire - started by a lightning strike - and more crews are on their way. They will include helicopters and other aircraft, which can drop thousands of litres of water or fire-retardant chemicals from low altitude. ""Smokejumpers"" - rapid-response units who parachute into inaccessible areas to tackle blazes - are also often deployed. Firefighting from the air Despite their skill, the difficulty of the firefighters' task is often directed by the weather. The most damaging fires occur in hot, dry and windy conditions. Gusty winds can cause large fires to ""leap"" across fire breaks and high temperatures and drought prolong a fire's life. How wildfires spread Another technique sometimes employed by firefighters is a ""backfire"" - creating a controlled blaze to either clear dry woodland and starve the fire of fuel, or with the aim of joining up with the main blaze so the combined fire burns itself out.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Deadly earthquake rocks India, Nepal and Tibet","The epicentre of the earthquake was in India's mountainous Sikkim state, where at least 18 people were killed. Rain and landslides are hindering search and rescue operations there and officials in Sikkim fear that the toll could rise further. Several earthquakes hit the region this year, but none caused major damage. At least five people were killed in Nepal, police there say, and at least seven died in Tibet, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. At least six other people were killed in other Indian states. Officials in all regions say the death toll is likely to rise as rescuers reach the remote mountainous areas struck by the quake. Power cuts The quake struck the mountainous north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim at 18:10 (12:40 GMT) on Sunday, according to the US Geological Survey, and was followed by two strong aftershocks. Telephone lines were knocked out across the state, while power cuts plunged Gangtok, the capital, into darkness just seconds after the quake hit. Hundreds of people there spent the night on the streets after buildings developed cracks, reports say. Tremors were felt in the north-eastern Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura. They were also felt in regions of India: West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Delhi. Bangladesh and Bhutan also felt the quake. One person was killed during a stampede as people panicked in a town in the eastern state of Bihar, and other deaths were reported near Darjeeling, in West Bengal. Landslides have blocked the two main highways linking Sikkim with the rest of the country making it difficult for the rescue workers to reach the area, reports say. Buildings evacuated Just over the border in Tibet's Yadong County, just 40km (miles) from Sikkim, the earthquake caused hundreds of landslides disrupting traffic, telecommunications, power and water supplies. Chinese authorities said relief supplies were on the way to the area. In Kathmandu, 270km (170 miles) west of the quake's epicentre, buildings were evacuated and traffic came to a standstill. Three people died when a wall of the British Embassy collapsed. Those dead included a motorcyclist and his eight-year-old child who were struck as they rode past, police said. Two others died in Dharan in Sunsari district, including a five-year-old child, according to the the Himalayan Times newspaper. Lawmakers in parliament hurried out of the building shouting when the quake struck in the middle of a debate on the budget, witnesses said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study,"Air pollution contributes to 40,000 early deaths each year in the UK and we gulp in more of it when we exercise. On the other hand, regular exercise reduces the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and several cancers. The University of Cambridge study showed that even in cities with high pollution levels, the benefits outweigh the risks. The researchers used computer simulations to compare data on different kinds of physical activity and different levels of air pollution in locations around the world. It found that for an average air pollution concentration in an urban area, the tipping point - when the risks begin to outweigh the benefits - comes after a huge seven hours of cycling or 16 hours of walking a day. It is far beyond what most people would ever do. ""Even in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world - with pollution levels 10 times those in London - people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits,"" said Dr Marko Tainio, the lead author of the study. He added: ""We should remember, though, that a small minority of workers in the most polluted cities, such as bike messengers, may be exposed to levels of air pollution high enough to cancel out the health benefits of physical activity."" The study, published in Preventive Medicine, said exercise was always beneficial in London. 'Action still needed' The average air pollution level for cities around the globe is 22 micrograms per cubic metre, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In London the air pollution level was recorded at 16 micrograms per cubic metre in 2011. Senior author Dr James Woodcock added: ""Whilst this research demonstrates the benefits of physical activity in spite of air quality, it is not an argument for inaction in combating pollution. ""It provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bikes - which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity."" The research was carried out by experts from the University of Cambridge's Centre for Diet and Activity Research and Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit, along with researchers from the University of East Anglia.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nora Ephron remembered at star-packed memorial,"Ephron, whose hit films include When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, died last month aged 71. 800 friends and family were invited to the Lincoln Center for the service. Ephron had planned the memorial herself, according to The New York Times , choosing the speakers and putting them in a folder marked 'exit'. Actor Martin Short took the stage first and revealed he'd been instructed by Ephron's son Jacob Bernstein: ""Don't be afraid to be funny"". Sleepless in Seattle star Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson performed an imitation of an average night with Ephron and her husband of 28 years, Nick Pileggi, according to The Huffington Post . Meryl Streep, who starred in two of Ephron's films, called her ""the hub of a friendship wheel"". Oscar-winner Streep played celebrity cook Julia Childs in Julie & Julia, and also starred in Heartburn, based on Ephron's novel about her own divorce from journalist Carl Bernstein. She said talking about the legendary screenwriter was a difficult assignment. ""How do you talk about a friend who said everything you wished you could say?"" Streep asked the audience. ""Everything you wanted to say in the world, but better and shorter and funnier?"" Ephron died of pneumonia on 26 June, brought on by acute myeloid leukaemia. Family members also spoke at the service, including sister Delia Ephron and son Jacob Bernstein. He said: ""She was my best friend, my biggest cheerleader, and a total drill sergeant, which is basically what a great parent is supposed to be"". Actress Meg Ryan, who worked with Ephron on When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail also attended, as did Steve Martin who starred in My Blue Heaven. Those paying their respects from the world of entertainment, media and publishing included Matthew Broderick, Sally Field, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, US television journalist Barbara Walters and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Speeches were also given by director-producer Mike Nichols, Rosie O'Donnell and Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. Cohen said: ""She was a latter-day, urbane Mark Twain. And she could cook."" To reflect Ephron's love of cooking, which inspired her to write and direct 2009's Julie & Julia, the memorial's programmes contained her recipes, including one for coconut macaroons. It is reported guests also sipped pink champagne in her honour after the service. Ephron's assistant of 14 years J.J. Sacha was the last speaker and introduced highlights from her movies, saying: ""She was proud of her work, and so she should be.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cornton Vale inmates to be moved to HMP Polmont,"More than half of the inmates at HMP Cornton Vale in Stirling will be relocated to HMP Polmont, near Falkirk, later this year. It marks the first phase of plans to close the facility. Mr Matheson has also said that construction of a new national women's prison will begin in mid 2018. The Scottish government announced plans to build the facility, which will cater for 80 offenders, last summer. It will be built close to the existing Cornton Vale prison and will house the country's most serious female offenders. 'Totally unacceptable' Another five regional units will also be created by 2020 to house up to 20 female prisoners each. Mr Matheson said the move to Polmont's newest accommodation, Blair House, would offer improved facilities for women in custody until the new units are complete. He added: ""By housing these women in smaller, community bases units closer to their families, alongside providing additional support to address the underlying issues which fuel their crime such as drugs, alcohol or mental ill-health, we can stop them from committing further crimes in the future. ""It is totally unacceptable that we have the second highest female prison population in northern Europe. This government continues to prioritise efforts to reduce the number of men and women serving custodial sentences. ""The actions we are taking are about tackling this problem head on through smarter approaches which can reduce prison numbers in Scotland."" Mr Matheson blocked previous plans for a new 300-inmate jail in Inverclyde in January 2015. Cornton Vale, which was built in 1975, has had a notorious history, being nicknamed ""the Vale of death"" after 11 prisoners killed themselves there between 1995 and 2002. 'Serious concern' Despite attempts to improve conditions, ministers decided Cornton Vale would close after former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini's 2012 report said it was ""not fit for purpose"". The most recent tally of women prisoners in Scotland put the total at 412, with 76 of them being on remand. Of the total, 222 were being held at Cornton Vale. Scottish Prison Service chief executive Colin McConnell said: ""Cornton Vale has been a serious concern for our service and for the justice system for far too long and it's truly rewarding that with the government's support and leadership we are now on the journey to seeing the back of it. ""The move for a large number of women to the fresh and modern conditions at Polmont will in itself be a significant improvement, making things better for them but also better for those who will remain at Cornton Vale for now.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"European elections 2019: Remainers are angry too, says Vince Cable","The Lib Dem leader told the BBC that young people felt their future had been ""taken away from them by a very narrow majority"" in the 2016 referendum. He suggested the Lib Dems would be ""snapping at the heels"" of the Brexit Party in Thursday's European election. He conceded austerity cuts imposed by the Lib Dem-Tory coalition after 2010 contributed to the Brexit result. ""It was painful and unpleasant and there were political consequences,"" he said of decisions by that coalition government to cut public spending. The Lib Dems are one of several parties contesting Thursday's elections which want the UK to remain in the EU. Sir Vince said, while it was unfortunate that pro-Remain parties were competing against each other for votes, he expected the total number of those votes to end up ""roughly similar"" to that won by the Brexit Party and UKIP. He said he expected the Lib Dems to get more votes than either Labour or the Conservatives and run Nigel Farage's Brexit Party a close second. 'Bitterly divided' Sir Vince said the country was ""bitterly divided"" and, while he acknowledged the frustration of those who voted to leave the EU, he said those who wanted to remain were also rightly dismayed about the current situation. ""I understand how angry people are on both sides. There are some angry Leavers and there are some very angry Remainers too, particularly young people who feel their future has been taken away from them on the basis of a very narrow majority, where a significant majority of the electorate did not vote and many young people did not get an opportunity to vote."" The way to resolve the current stalemate, he suggested, would be to ask the public to confirm whether they still wanted to leave in another public vote. This would not be a rerun of the 2016 referendum, he insisted, because the country was in a ""totally different place"" to three years ago. ""I'm afraid the referendum resolved nothing and we do have to go back to the people and ask if what is now on offer is what they really voted for. ""We have got completely different views about what Brexit actually means. What has emerged over the last three years is that the prospectus on which the Leave vote was achieved was based on a tissue of lies to be frank."" He said he was confident the public would vote to stay in the EU in another referendum and he would not be joining calls, at this stage, to stop Brexit in its tracks by revoking Article 50, which he described as the ""extreme, nuclear option"". Sir Vince said he would be leaving the party in a strong position when he steps down as leader after the European elections. ""We are a major national political force again and will be when the general election comes around.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tony Nicklinson's 'courage' will lead to law change,"Mr Nicklinson, a man with locked-in syndrome who fought to legally end his life, died on Wednesday. Lord Joffe, a right-to-die campaigner, said the law needs to be changed and ""MPs are not listening to society"". Mr Nicklinson, 58, from Melksham, Wiltshire, described his life as a ""living nightmare"" after he was paralysed following a stroke in 2005. Last week he lost his High Court battle to allow doctors to end his life. Lord Joffe, who has been campaigning for a change of the law on assisted dying, said: ""I think Tony Nicklinson's incredible courage and determination has persuaded society that the law must be changed to prevent terrible suffering."" In 2006, Lord Joffe put forward a bill on assisted dying that was blocked by the House of Lords. And last year, Mr Nicklinson said he felt ""let down"" after The Commission on Assisted Dying concluded it could not condone a doctor being allowed to end his life. 'Society's best interests' ""I think Tony correctly felt there needed to be a change in the law to permit him to end his life,"" said Lord Joffe. ""And it is clear that we do need a change in the law - the law must seek to find such a solution."" Earlier this year, MPs backed guidelines that to prosecute someone who helps another to die must be in the public interest and must take account of the suspect's motivation. But, according to Lord Joffe, the guidelines ""excluded doctors"". ""MPs are not listening to society,"" he said. ""Their job is to take account of the views of their constituents and 80% of the public is in favour of a change in the law."" The British Medical Association does not want the law changed. It said ""it does not believe that it would be in society's best interests for doctors to be able to legally end a patient's life"". Dr Andrew Ferguson, from the group Care Not Killing, said: ""When you change the law on something as fundamental as murder you actually remove legal protection from other vulnerable groups. ""There are obvious groups like the disabled, those who are depressed, who are terminally ill - it could create very dangerous precedents indeed."" 'Influence Parliament' But Lord Joffe believes the debate on assisted dying will continue. ""The legislation which we have proposed, and are currently putting out to consultation, is to ascertain the views of society on this issue in the hopes that this will influence parliament to change the law in an appropriate way to prevent such suffering,"" he said. ""And indeed it is proposed that a new bill on assisted dying will be introduced in parliament in the next year by Lord Falconer and hopefully in the end - I'm certain - there will be a change in the law."" Another man with locked-in syndrome, known only as Martin, who contested his case at the same time as Mr Nicklinson, has announced he will be appealing against the High Court decision.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Golden hello' offered to some new GPs in Scotland,"One hundred new GP training places are being advertised, with a Â£20,000 incentive for some who choose to take up hard to fill posts. Some medical bodies are concerned Scotland is facing a GP crisis, with certain areas restricting patient lists because they are reaching capacity. The Scottish government said it was refocusing the role of GPs. The new scheme will offer a one-off bursary of Â£20,000 to trainees who commit to being trained in posts that have not been filled recently. Many of these are in isolated rural communities. The posts qualifying for the incentive include placements based in Arran, Inverness, Fort William and Oban. Others are in Dumfries and Galloway, Angus, Aberdeenshire, Glasgow and Lanarkshire. NHS Dumfries and Galloway's Medical Director, Angus Cameron, told BBC Scotland: ""This is excellent news. We believe we have superb training available in Dumfries and Galloway. ""We really welcome the extra incentive to help encourage doctors to choose a career in rural general practice starting here."" Health Secretary Shona Robison said general practice was at the ""heart"" of the NHS. ""We are also investing in the future of the profession - developing new ways of working with multi-disciplinary teams and refocusing the role of the GP as the expert medical generalist within our community health service,"" she said. ""We've also abolished the bureaucratic system of GP payments, QOF, and are working on a new Scottish GP contract to support our wider efforts to make primary care services fit for the future."" 'Fantastic career' The Scottish government said the 100 new places brought the total number of GP specialist training posts advertised this year to 439. Scotland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Gregor Smith, who previously practised as a GP, said: ""Working in general practice can give you a wide and varied career - one in which every day is different and you never know what will come through the door next. ""There are some fantastic opportunities for training available in Scotland - whether that is working in inner city communities or with remote and rural populations, all within a flexible and supportive training environment."" He added: ""It is a fantastic career and one which I would highly recommend to junior doctors."" The application window opens on 9 August, and closes on 25 August.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"House prices see biggest monthly fall since 2010, Halifax says","The lender said prices fell by 3.1% between March and April, the biggest decline since September 2010. The bank said that housing demand had softened in the early months of this year, with both mortgage approvals and completed home sales edging down. On an annual basis, price growth slowed to 2.2% from March's rate of 2.7%. The average price of a home in the UK is now Â£220,952, according to the Halifax. Despite the sharp drop in prices between March and April, the Halifax said the monthly figures tended to be volatile, and stuck to its existing forecast range for price growth this year. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: ""The UK labour market is performing strongly with unemployment continuing to fall and wage growth finally picking up. ""These factors should help to ease pressure on household finances and as a result we expect annual price growth will remain in our forecast range of 0% and 3% this year."" 'Clearly struggling' Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that the market for house buyers was likely to ""remain challenging"". ""Consumers have faced an extended serious squeeze on purchasing power, which is only gradually easing,"" he said. ""Additionally, housing market activity remains hampered by relatively fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. ""The housing market is clearly currently struggling to gain traction and we suspect that any meaningful upturn will remain elusive over the coming months."" Recent figures suggest that the squeeze on wages by higher inflation is easing. The Office for National Statistics said that the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation fell to 2.5% in March.

Scottish women return after stem cell transplants in Russia,"By David CowanBBC Scotland Jill McLaren and Michele Murray have been living with multiple sclerosis for almost 20 years. They travelled to Moscow for stem cell transplants after initial travel plans were cancelled because of the pandemic. The procedure aims to ""reboot"" their immune systems, stopping their MS in its tracks. After a month of gruelling treatment, they have now travelled back to Scotland and were met by their families at Edinburgh Airport. Jill said: ""I can't even explain how amazing it is to be back. It's been really hard, but it'll be worth it."" She said she had come home MS-free. ""Next is the long recovery and rehabilitation. If this gives us a chance to get our lives back, I'll take it."" The women were unable to get the transplants through the NHS in Scotland, however Michele's treatment was paid for through crowd funding. ""It's been absolutely amazing,"" she said. ""Everyone has just been so kind. I'm in awe of them. The generosity has just been unbelievable, it really has."" Fighting MS together Over 15,000 people in Scotland have multiple sclerosis, a lifelong neurological condition which affects the brain and spinal cord and can lead to serious disability. Instead of fighting off infection, the immune system attacks the nerves which control different parts of the body. The illness forced Jill to give up her career in radio and with her health worsening, the mother of twins from Edinburgh decided to undergo the transplant. Michele, who's from Tain in the Highlands, had reached the same decision and they travelled together to Moscow last month. 'Life changing results' Haematopietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an aggressive procedure that carries risks. The MS Society Scotland says for some people it results in ""life-changing results"" but it's not effective for all types of the disease. Stem cells are taken from the patient's bone marrow or blood before chemotherapy wipes out the immune system. The stem cells are then reintroduced to the body, where they grow a new immune system. The women could take up to a year to recover and will be extremely vulnerable to serious infections for months. Jill said: ""We won't be able to see anyone for the next few weeks outside our immediate families, and probably it'll be after new year before we can actually see other see people. ""We'll be monitored all the time to make sure our recovery is going well enough. We've got a baby immune system now and we just have to be really, really careful. ""We've overcome the big hurdle, the one that really punished the body. Now it's time to repair it and hopefully get back to a normal life.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gunman's parents 'raced to stop him',"They raced to Isla Vista but heard radio reports on the shootings as they drove, friend Simon Astaire told US media. Elliot Rodger, 22, warned of his intentions in his emailed manifesto and a YouTube video posted the day before. Hundreds gathered at a memorial service in the college town to mourn the dead. Three more of the victims were named on Sunday night - Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, George Chen, 19, and Weihan Wang, 20, were stabbed in Rodger's apartment. They were his first victims before he killed three more and wounded 13 others in a shooting rampage. Rodger died after speeding through the town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with police, authorities said. He was found dead in his car from a gunshot wound to the head, believed to be self-inflicted, with three legally purchased semi-automatic weapons. Moments before he began opening fire, Rodger emailed his parents, therapist and others to inform them of his intentions in a 140-page ""manifesto"" entitled My Twisted World. His mother Li Chin called the police before she and ex-husband Peter Rodger raced to Isla Vista from Los Angeles in separate cars, but heard en route about the shooting, family friend Simon Astaire told US media. In a video posted on YouTube on Thursday, Rodger spoke of his plan to ""slaughter"" women at a sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara. He described the rejection he felt because he had never been able to attract girls, and how he intended to exact revenge. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said his department had visited Rodger at the end of April at the request of his family when they saw disturbing videos he recorded but officers found him to be polite and courteous, and no further action was taken. Rodger had seen therapists off and on since he was nine years old and possessed ""an underlying sadness"", Mr Astaire told Reuters. There was no suggestion he had any interest in guns. In his manifesto, he said he feared police would foil his plot when they visited him. ""I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it,"" he wrote. ""If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. ""I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that."" Katherine Cooper, 22, Veronika Weiss, 19, and Christopher Martinez, 20, were earlier named as Rodger's shootings victims. In an emotional statement, Ricardo Martinez said the death of his son Christopher had left his family ""lost and broken"", and he blamed ""craven politicians"" and gun rights advocates.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The psychological secrets to successful resolutions,"Unfortunately, quite a few fail. But there are some psychological tactics which can be employed to increase the chances of success. 1. Persistence Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, has carried out research into the key to sticking to resolutions. In a study of 5,000 people who made resolutions, it was those with a ""fatalistic attitude"" who were less likely to succeed. He advises it's more than likely old habits will creep back in sometimes, so see those occasions as temporary set-backs and not a reason to give up altogether. ""Failure is the main thing that stops people If, on day one of their diet, they raid the biscuit tin, they think 'that's it' and give up. But persistence is the key. Start again the next day."" 2. Spread the word Support from friends and family can help people stick to their goals. But Prof Wiseman says women might be more likely to benefit. ""They are generally better at offering moral support. Men tend to try and encourage you to have more dessert."" 3. Plotting progress This can be something public like a blog - or the fridge door - or more privately, in a spreadsheet or a journal. It might help to note down each gym visit, or decision not to have cake. Prof Wiseman also advises having a checklist to show how life will be better once your goals are achieved - and allow small rewards throughout the process to keep up motivation levels. 4. Have achievable goals It has to be something specific that can be realistically achieved. Running a marathon, say, would be too much for a non-runner to aim for, while a vague desire to 'get fit' is hard to measure. ""Maybe start by saying you'll go to the gym once a week, then you can look at moving up to two,"" advises Prof Wiseman. And be realistic - it's best to choose one thing to focus on rather than having a raft of goals to increase the chances of success. 5. Understand triggers This is important in terms of knowing what prompts behaviour you want to avoid - and to help encourage healthier habits. ""It could be as simple as not having biscuits in the house so you're not tempted - or understanding the stress triggers that make you reach for a cigarette,"" Prof Wiseman says. And he says it's possible to create new triggers to prompt you in your new, healthier habits. ""You can decide that when the news starts, that's the time when you set off for the gym"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid:19: Robin Swann hopes for memorial in NI,"It has been a year since the first case of coronavirus was recorded in Northern Ireland. The death toll recorded by the Department of Health is 2,055, with three more deaths reported on Sunday. Mr Swann said he wanted his colleagues on the Stormont executive to consider a proposal for a memorial. He said conversations had been held within the Department of Health about remembering those who had lost their lives. ""It's how we do this in a respectful way but also acknowledging the sacrifice of loss and also, at the same time, the sacrifice of service from our health service families,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme. ""From many across our voluntary and communities sector as well, who helped their communities at the time that they were at their most vulnerable. ""So it's something I'm very keen to put a proposal forward to my executive colleagues about how we do that."" Reflecting on the beginning of the pandemic, Mr Swann said the projected number of deaths in Northern Ireland ""shook"" ministers and they had to prepare for the ""worst-case scenario"". He said there would be a period of reflection and inquiry but that for now the world remained ""in the teeth"" of the crisis. The former Ulster Unionist Party leader said that when he was appointed health minister in January last year it was originally intended he would serve as health minister for a ""few months until things settled down"". However, there was a ""conscious decision to keep that continuity"" when the pandemic started. A total of 112,493 positive cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Northern Ireland, with 136 confirmed on Sunday. Saturday marked exactly one year since Northern Ireland recorded its first case. In the Republic of Ireland six more Covid-19 deaths were recorded on Sunday, taking the country's total to 4,319. Another 612 people have tested positive in the country in the past day. More than half a million people in Northern Ireland have had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. That is about 27% of the overall population and about 35% of the adult population. 'Lockdown breaches' On Sunday police said a gathering of about 250 people at an ""organised fight"" was a ""clearly a breach"" of the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.

"Somerset badger cull fails to meet target, Defra admits","The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were ""designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers"". ""I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November,"" said Mr Paterson. ""During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. ""This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. ""While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane."" Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of Â£100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a ""complete failure"" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' ""The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards,"" said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. ""Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. ""The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping."" Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because ""the badgers have moved the goalposts"". ""By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations,"" she said. ""David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
David Cameron backs Maria Miller as expenses inquiry launched,"The prime minister said his culture secretary had ""excellent answers"" to questions about her expenses claims. Labour MP John Mann submitted a complaint about her claims on Tuesday. It follows reports she had allowed her parents to live in a property on which she claimed Â£90,718 in second home allowances during the last parliament. Mrs Miller has said her expenses were ""absolutely in order"" and ""in complete accordance with the rules"". Mr Cameron, speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a European summit, said Mrs Miller was doing ""an excellent job"". The Daily Telegraph reported that Mrs Miller had been claiming expenses for her second home in south London, while her parents were living there, with her ""main home"" located in her Basingstoke constituency. Her parents, John and June Lewis, have apparently been living at the property since selling their home in Wales in 1996. Following the report, Mr Mann wrote to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, John Lyon, saying the arrangement was ""identical"" to that which meant former Labour minister Tony McNulty was required to pay back more than Â£13,000 in expenses in 2009. 'Threat' The commissioner ruled that Mr McNulty had effectively ""subsidised"" his parent's living costs from the public purse. A spokesman for Mrs Miller said her ""expenses have been audited twice and found to be wholly proper and above board"". ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue,"" he said, adding that the minister would ""fully co-operate"" with the inquiry. But, during exchanges on future business in the Commons, Labour's Angela Eagle raised a follow-up report in the Daily Telegraph, which said an aide to Mrs Miller had called the journalist working on the expenses story to ""flag up"" the culture secretary's involvement in on-going negotiations on the future of press regulation. The Daily Telegraph has also reported that Downing Street communications chief Craig Oliver mentioned press regulation in a telephone call to the newspaper's editor about the expenses story. Ms Eagle, the shadow Commons leader, said: ""The government seems to want to threaten the press with statutory underpinning to control the news agenda."" No 10 denied doing anything wrong: ""The secretary of state [Mrs Miller] had some concerns about the way that investigation was conducted. She set those out in a letter to the editor. Craig Oliver was simply reflecting those concerns.""

Kincora should be part of UK inquiry into child abuse says Amnesty,"It follows claims of an establishment ""cover-up"" over allegations of paedophile activity at Westminster. Home Secretary Teresa May has announced a new investigation into how government handled the claims. Now Amnesty's NI director Patrick Corrigan has called for Kincora to be part of that inquiry. Three senior care staff at the east Belfast children's home were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys in their care. ""There have been long-standing public concerns that we really never got to the bottom of what went on in Kincora,"" Mr Corrigan told Radio Ulster's Talkback on Tuesday. ""There are fears that there were many more victims and abusers during the period between 1960 and 1980. ""Allegations have persisted that paedophilia at Kincora was linked to British intelligence services, with claims that visitors to the home included members of the military, politicians and civil servants, and that police investigations into abuse at Kincora were blocked by the Ministry of Defence and MI5."" Mr Corrigan said that while the current Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) inquiry into child abuse at institutions in Northern Ireland includes Kincora, it has only limited powers. 'Buried secrets?' ""The current Northern Ireland inquiry is unable to compel the release of files from either Whitehall or the secret services, and given the nature of the allegations over Kincora, this is exactly where any secrets are likely to lie buried,"" he said. ""The new wide-ranging Hillsborough-style inquiry announced by the Home Secretary must now be allowed to investigate the allegations that have long surrounded Kincora. ""With Kincora, the power to secure the release of key documents from Whitehall or MI5 filing cabinets is absolutely vital. ""Nothing less than the inclusion of the Kincora home in the new inquiry is liable to see the truth finally arrived at and justice finally delivered."" East Belfast MP Naomi Long said: ""We haven't really dispelled the rumours surrounding the Kincora scandal. There are victims still around and they deserve justice."" She said that given the remit of the Westminster inquiry, it was perhaps ""a better vehicle,"" for Kincora. Sinn FÃ©in MP Michelle Gildernew said allegations that MI5 had a role in Kincora were ""particularly shocking"". ""It has been claimed that not only were MI5 aware of the horrendous abuse of vulnerable young boys, but monitored it and attempted to use it for their own gain,"" she said. ""The British government needs to listen to the growing calls from a range of groups, including Amnesty International, for a full inquiry into what happened at Kincora.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scrap metal laws to be tightened to tackle theft,"Home Secretary Theresa May announced the proposed new laws in a written statement to MPs. The measures will end the current ""low-risk transactions"" for people who steal metal - such as cables - which have disrupted rail services, she said. Labour said the measures did not go far enough to tackle the ""epidemic"". The metal recycling industry is worth Â£5.6bn and employs 8,000 people in the UK. There have been growing calls for action as metal thefts from railways have increased in recent years - causing disruption to 3.8 million passengers last year and costing more than Â£16m. Many churches have had lead stolen from their roofs, while copper has been taken from telephone exchanges and building sites. In a parliamentary statement, Mrs May said a change in the law was the ""only sustainable, long-term solution to the growing menace of metal theft. ""There is an urgent need to make stealing metal less attractive to criminals, and tackling the stolen metal market will act as a significant deterrent"". She announced that fines for all offences listed under the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act would rise. Cash payments for scrap metal would be banned, as they led to ""anonymous, low-risk transactions"" for thieves and meant ""poor record keeping"" within the industry, Mrs May said. The new measures will be added as amendments to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. Her announcement came on the day the Commons transport committee called for these and other measures to tackle metal theft. The committee's chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said of the scrap metal industry: ""It's a Steptoe and Son situation... no questions asked."" For Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said proposals to increase fines and stop cash payments at scrap yards were welcome. But she said police needed greater powers to enter scrap metal yards and close dealers not obeying the rules. ""The Government needs to get serious on metal theft... wire theft is causing repeated power cuts, plunging communities regularly into darkness, and putting lives at risk. ""Yet despite this growing problem, the Home Secretary is being too slow and too sluggish."" She said Labour would be putting forward tougher and more substantial proposals in Parliament next week.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nintendo forecasts loss amid weak Wii U sales,"It now expects to make an operating loss of 35bn yen ($335m; Â£205m) for the financial year ending 31 March 2014. Its initial estimate was for an operating profit of 100bn yen. Nintendo said the key reason behind the downgrade was weaker-than-expected sales during the holiday season. ""In the year-end sales season which constitutes the highest proportion of the annual sales volume, software sales with a relatively high margin were significantly lower than our original forecasts,"" the firm said in a statement. Losing faith It said weak software sales were ""mainly due to the fact that hardware sales did not reach their expected level"". The company cut its global Wii U sales forecast for the business year from nine million to 2.8 million units - a cut of nearly 70%. It also reduced the sales forecast for its 3DS console from 18 million to 13.5 million units. Three months ago Nintendo was standing by its sales projections for the Wii U, despite signs, from the UK at least, that retailers were losing faith in the product. In July last year, UK supermarket chain Asda said it would no longer be selling the Wii U in its stores. Online streaming Nintendo has faced tough competition from rival games console makers, such as Microsoft with its new Xbox One, and Sony with its new PlayStation 4. There is also a general trend towards online streaming of games to make them available over a variety of devices, such as mobiles and smart TVs. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Sony announced that PlayStation Now subscribers will be able to play some of the platform's greatest hits without the need to own a console. Sony said it may offer its games to third-party products as well. 'Disappointing' This month Nintendo's shares received a boost after China lifted a sales ban on foreign video games consoles. The Chinese government said it would allow foreign firms to make consoles in the recently-launched Shanghai free trade zone and sell them across the country. Nintendo's shares have risen 56% over the last 52-week period, reaching a two-and-a-half year high in January, but this latest profits warning - issued after the Tokyo markets closed - is likely to affect the share price on Monday. ""The fact that the Wii U strategy has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sabarimala temple: Indian women form '620km human chain' for equality,"The Sabarimala shrine was historically closed to women of ""menstruating age"" - defined as between 10 and 50. India's top court overturned the ban in September, but protesters have since attacked female visitors. The ""women's wall"" was organised by the state's left-wing coalition government. Officials told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that around five million women from various parts of Kerala had gathered across all national highways to form the chain, which stretched from the northern tip of Kasaragod to the southern end in Thiruvanthapuram. Organisers had predicted a turnout of around three million. Officials said the short demonstration was to combat inequality and counter the efforts of right-wing groups that support the ban on women. One young demonstrator, Kavita Das, told BBC Hindi: ""This is a great way of saying how powerful women are, and how we can empower ourselves and help each other. Of course, I support the move to allow women of all ages into the temple. I don't think tradition or any kind of backwardness should stop women. Those who want to pray must have the right to pray."" Another woman, Tanuja Bhattadri, observed: ""Sabarimala is not the main issue here today. I believe men and women are equal."" Why is the ban so political? The Supreme Court decision to let women worship at the Sabarimala shrine came after a petition argued that the custom banning them violated gender equality. But India's ruling party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has argued that the ruling is an attack on Hindu values. The issue has become increasingly contentious in the run-up to India's general election, scheduled for April and May. Critics have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of pursuing a religiously divisive agenda to court the BJP's mostly-Hindu support base. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals - but most temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, rather than banning women in a broad age group from entering at all. 'The temple god is a bachelor' Protesters have also argued that the court ruling goes against the wishes of the temple's deity, Lord Ayappa. They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity, who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy - and hence the ban. Very few women have tried to enter the temple amid massive protests in the state, and many who tried have been forced to turn back. Two women managed to reach the main temple premises in October, with more than 100 police protecting them from stone-throwing protesters as they walked the last 5km stretch to the shrine. They were ultimately forced to turn round after a stand-off with devotees, just metres from Sabarimala's sanctum.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dumfries and Galloway Council made Â£6.9m waste deal payment,"The figure emerged after a BBC Freedom of Information request about the financial impact of ending the contract on the Dumfries and Galloway authority. Company accounts of Shanks Dumfries and Galloway show the council paid it a ""termination sum"" of Â£6,873,434. A number of assets transferred to the local authority as a result, including an Eco Deco waste treatment plant. The council entered into a 25-year PFI contract for its waste services in 2004. 'Commonplace' clauses However, last year the private company involved sought to terminate the deal citing an annual loss of about Â£3m. The contract was ended in September 2018. A BBC FOI request sought to find out why it had cost the council more than Â£6m to end the deal when it had been its private partner who wanted it to conclude. The council initially refused to release the information and an appeal was taken to the Information Commissioner. However, the council has now revealed some details relating to the case. It explained that it was ""commonplace"" for most contracts to have clauses relating to early termination. It said they were almost a ""prerequisite"" of such long-term deals as circumstances could change significantly over their duration. Assets transferred The council said contractors often put in place infrastructure, and arrangements would be made when a contract ended early to calculate what payments were due. After the waste deal was terminated, a range of assets transferred to the local authority including the Eco Deco plant in Dumfries, two transfer stations at Annan and Castle Douglas, eight recycling centres and five closed landfill sites. The FOI also sought to establish if the council expected to face similar losses in running the service to those reported by its private partner. The local authority said work was ongoing to look at options for a ""new model of delivery"" which were likely to go before councillors later this year. It said that, at that stage, a comparison could be made of costs before and after the contract termination. As a result of the information being released, the BBC has agreed to drop its appeal to the Information Commissioner.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Slow progress' on child abuse claims in Pembrokeshire,"A follow-up report says improvements have been made in child safeguarding. But management of allegations against Pembrokeshire council professionals remains ""inconsistent"". The council is considering the findings. Claims had emerged of children locked in a padded ""time-out"" room at a referral unit. The authority was heavily criticised by an earlier report in November 2011. The latest review by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) says there has been a big increase in the number of referrals from schools in relation to allegations against professionals working with children. This might be due to a ""better understanding of safeguarding responsibilities"", the report says. The Welsh government sent experts in to oversee the council in 2011 after serious problems were highlighted in safeguarding children. Allegations have emerged about children being locked in rooms and of one's hands being tied by a teacher. In July, council leader Jamie Adams apologised to children who had been locked in a padded time-out room with no natural light or ventilation at a pupil referral unit in Neyland. The review published on Friday looks at how 20 cases of alleged professional abuse were handled by the council and other agencies between April 2011 and April 2012. Nineteen cases related to allegations against school or education staff and one involved a member of staff from social services. 'Fear' The report says the poor quality of minutes for strategy meetings, first highlighted last year, has not improved. It is one of seven ""key areas"" where ""progress has been slow"". In a few of these meetings it was apparent that the behaviour of children and their families were presented as problems. The way issues were considered was ""not always forensic"" and sometimes there was an underlying tension between the agencies involved. In some cases where professionals had been the subject of previous allegations relevant information was not always ""assimilated and assesses"". Police case records show staff who appeared to know about allegations were sometimes ""reluctant"" to disclose what they knew because of ""fear of the adverse effect this would have on their employment or the reaction they would get from their colleagues"". It says: ""Overall this lack of consistency means that the authority and the police are yet to achieve the level of assurance they need about handling allegations of professional abuse."" In a statement Pembrokeshire council said: ""We are considering the findings in the report by the CSSIW and are continuing to focus our efforts on improving the arrangements for safeguarding children."" The Welsh government welcomed the improvements and said it was ""pleasing to see some positive progress being made"". A spokesman added: ""As the report notes however, there remain areas where the authority needs to make further improvement. ""The minister for education and skills reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that Pembrokeshire works to address issues of concern and this report supports his approach. """,Human,English,BBC,,,1
St George's Reforne church restored to former glory,"High above the cliff tops of the Isle of Portland's West Bay sits St George's Reforne church. Its mystery and intrigue become ever more compelling when the sea mist rolls in and shrouds it in cloud. St George's is a church that has been on a difficult journey. Among those buried in its graveyard include survivors of the Titanic, massacred victims of the Royal Navy's press gang and a man whose house fell down on top of him. But, finally St George's looks to be heading back to its rightful place as a valued community asset. Visitors flocking Dwindling congregations and accumulating repairs meant that in 1971, The Churches Conservation Trust first took possession of St George's when still known as The Redundant Churches Fund. Today, following five months of restoration work, visitors are flocking to enjoy the rejuvenated building. Dr Neil Rushton, conservation manager with The Churches Restoration Trust (CCT), admits it has been a journey of discovery. He said: ""There's been some valuable support to get this project off the ground and through to what we see today. ""Something in the region of Â£800,000 has been spent on repairs, but there have been elements of that work which have also been separately funded."" Wessex Archaeology carried out a full archaeological survey of the 18th Century building. Soldiers returning from active service have also been involved in the restoration. A small number played their part as members of Wessex Archaeology's initiative Operation Nightingale, where servicemen are training in the latest techniques as a form of rehabilitation. Dr Rushton added: ""Architecturally, this is also an extremely unusual church. ""Thomas Gilbert in the mid-18th Century was attempting to mimic St Paul's Cathedral in London in terms of design. ""The flattened dome as it ended up, either because he ran out of money or couldn't get it right, is extremely difficult to maintain in terms of guarding against water intrusion, so that's what's taken up the bulk of the project."" Despite the church's resurrection, sadly its complete restoration is still to be realised. Another Â£500,000 is required to fund more vital repairs in the next five years. To bridge that funding gap, the CCT hope to take advantage of an active local community, including hosting local art exhibitions such as Pop Up Dorset. Students from nearby Royal Manor Arts College are playing an active role, exhibiting their own artwork and carrying architectural surveys. The hope is more visitors and more initiatives will secure the church's long-term sustainability.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Luton Borough Council proposes cuts to plug Â£22m shortfall,"Luton Borough Council said its income from Luton Airport ""has all but dried up"". It faced a Â£50m shortfall and needed to save nearly Â£22m. Without ""adequate emergency funding"" the authority ""will be forced to implement extreme savings"", it said. The government said it was giving councils ""unprecedented support"". As the majority shareholder in Luton Airport, the council usually benefits from an annual dividend of about Â£27m, but it said with aviation at a virtual standstill since March, it had been placed ""in the painful situation of having to propose severe cuts to a number of key front-line services"". 'Deaf ears' The proposals include stopping the school meals service, reductions in highways maintenance, charging for green waste collection and reduced funding for adult social care and mental health support services. They also include the loss of at least 365 posts, but they would also be scrapping vacant posts and offering voluntary redundancies. The council has received Â£11.2m in emergency government funding, but as well as the airport money, other income streams ""have also been hard hit"", so it has asked the government for a further Â£50m in emergency funds. Labour council leader Hazel Simmons said: ""The council has repeatedly called on central government to provide adequate emergency funding, but so far these pleas have fallen on deaf ears. ""If they continue to adopt this stance of indifference we will be forced to implement extreme savings measures to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy, which itself would have an even more destructive impact on services."" The MP for North East Bedfordshire, Richard Fuller said last month that the council should sell 25% of the airport which would provide it with ""more than enough money to plug its gap"" and the government had every reason to refuse to bail it out. He said it had used its airport income to ""cover additional annual expenditure"" while other councils ""relied on local rates, council taxes and central government funding"" to provide services. ""Councils should be treated on an equivalent basis in meeting their additional costs. Replacing money from commercial ventures should be excluded,"" he said. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said its ""unprecedented package of support"" for councils included Â£3.2bn emergency funding. ""Luton Council will receive Â£11.26m of this to deal with the pressures of coronavirus, while its core spending power rose by Â£8.94m this financial year even before additional emergency funding was announced,"" a spokesman said. ""We recognise that some councils with strategic investments, such as airports, are put in an exceptional position by this crisis. We'll continue to work closely with Luton Council to help them navigate through what is undoubtedly a difficult situation, as they support their communities through this national emergency.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Sydney seaplane crash: Sharp turn 'inexplicable', operator says","Five members of a British family and a Canadian pilot died in the incident on 31 December. There were no survivors. A preliminary report, released on Wednesday, did not draw any conclusions about why the plane had crashed. But Sydney Seaplanes described events moments before the crash as ""totally inexplicable"". The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report said the DHC-2 Beaver had made a steep right turn before diving nose-first into the Hawkesbury River at Jerusalem Bay, about 50km (30 miles) from the city. ""The key question arising from the report is why the plane crashed approximately half way down Jerusalem Bay... the plane simply should not have been where it was,"" said Sydney Seaplanes chief executive Aaron Shaw. Among the victims was Richard Cousins, the chief executive of FTSE 100 catering company Compass Group. Mr Cousins, 58, died alongside his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The pilot had flown the authorised route ""hundreds of times before"", Mr Shaw said. ""A turn of this nature at low altitude by a pilot with Gareth's skills, experience and intimate knowledge of the location is totally inexplicable,"" he said. The ATSB said it was investigating why Mr Morgan had flown in that direction. ""We don't have a preferred theory at this stage as to why he went off course,"" transport safety director Nat Nagy said. Mr Nagy said investigators were exploring whether the sudden turn was ""an attempt to turn around or whether it was a planned turn"". The pilot had more than 10,000 hours of flying experience - including about 9,000 hours on floatplanes. He had appeared to be in a ""high standard of health"", the report said. Mr Morgan and the family from Tooting, in south-west London, had been flying back to Sydney from a waterfront restaurant near the crash site. Cause remains unclear Mr Nagy said he could not guarantee that the cause of the crash would be identified in the final report, due in a year. ""It is possible that we're not able to know exactly what happened in that cockpit,"" he said. In its preliminary findings, investigators said there was no evidence of damage to the plane or any ""flight control issues"". A survey of the wreckage found: There was no voice or flight data recorder on board - neither were required by regulations for an aircraft of such size, the ATSB said. The plane had last undergone maintenance in November. A new engine had also been installed then as part of a scheduled changeover, and subsequently tested, the report said. Investigators said they would retain the engine, propeller and several aircraft components for further examination.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Demi Lovato fans organise 'get well soon' singalong,"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter But rather than getting angry, the fans who'd arrived at the venue got together to send a message to the singer, who'd taken ill earlier in the day. Gathering at the Peninsular Spire in Greenwich, just outside the O2, they held up ""get well soon"" signs and sang a chorus of Lovato's hit Skyscraper. The video found its way to the singer, who said the gesture ""made me cry"". ""My fans are seriously the best,"" she added. ""I can't believe how much love and support I've received today."" Two of her fans, Abbie and Alex, were behind the singalong at the O2. Abbie told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat that she organised it because ""everyone looked so sad and everyone knows all the words to every song. ""It was just so funny because no one could actually sing but brought together we actually made a pretty good choir,"" she said. Alex added ""A sing-a-long obviously brings everyone together. ""There were people from Poland, France and they came from all walks of life."" Abbie said that when the fans saw Demi had tweeted the video that everyone screamed with excitement. ""I don't think anyone's heard screams like that in a while,"" she said. Lovato, who is suffering from swollen vocal cords, postponed Sunday night's show just 45 minutes before the doors were due to open. Announcing the news on Twitter, she said she had consulted a doctor, who said she could cause permanent damage to her voice if the concert went ahead, ""It breaks my heart to let you down.

Coastguard rescues suspected migrants off Kent coast,"The BBC has been told some of the passengers phoned relatives in Calais to say they were in trouble after their boat started taking in water overnight. French authorities were then alerted and contacted the UK coastguard. Border Force officials are interviewing all 20, including two Britons. A woman and two children are among them. The UK coastguard said it was called just before midnight on Saturday to an incident off the coastal village of Dymchurch. A helicopter from nearby Lydd and two lifeboats with coastguard rescue teams from Dungeness and Folkestone began the search. About two hours later, at 02:00 BST, a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, known as a rhib, with 20 people on board was found. Border Force staff later removed another boat from the beach at Dymchurch as part of their investigation. Officials believe it may have been part of a wider operation. Dymchurch resident Tomi Ball Bartholomeou said he had seen the rescue operation taking place. ""All of a sudden this huge helicopter has come down and basically is on the beach. So we ran up there as fast as we could and all of a sudden like 50 police officers have come down out of nowhere, and you could see this massive raft just crashed on the floor."" Parish councillor Roger Wilkins said: ""I believe that there are people that are being paid to bring these people across from France. The coastguards and everybody now has got to be more vigilant, the people of Dymchurch will have to be more vigilant, if they see something suspicious or something that they are not happy [about] they must, obviously, get in contact with the police."" After being rescued, the group were handed over to the UK Border Force and taken to Dover. An immigration spokesman for the Home Office said they were currently being interviewed by Border Force officers. A Coastguard statement said: ""A call was received at 11.40pm yesterday requesting assistance to the RHIB, which was taking on water. ""The RHIB... was located at 2am and the incident handed over to UK Border Force."" The incident comes after 17 men, thought to be Albanian migrants, were detained after a catamaran arrived at Chichester Marina in West Sussex on Tuesday, along with a 55-year-old British man wanted on suspicion of murder in Spain.

Warning of challenges for UK oil sector from Wood Group,"Bob Keiller warned that the second half of the North Sea story is going to be different from the first. He was speaking ahead of the Offshore Europe exhibition and conference in Aberdeen. Mr Keiller said the industry has been too slow to change the way it operates over the past 10 years. During that time, the cost of extraction per barrel has risen four fold. And he says there will have to be more sub-contracting of activities to operate efficiently. Mr Keiller was speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Business Scotland programme. ""People are realising the second half of the North Sea story is going to be different from the first half,"" he said. ""People are going to have to be more imaginative in terms of how we arrange what we do, so that we don't end up with duplication of effort, driving up costs by unnecessary competition between different parties. ""I think there's still a long way to go in that. If you look at the set-up today, it doesn't look that dissimilar from what we had maybe ten years ago."" Technical issues He said he shares worries of the trade body Oil and Gas UK that output has fallen faster than expected in the past two years. ""If you look across the assets we have in the North Sea, many are way beyond their design life, and some are suffering specific technical issues. There are challenges there, because there's still a lot of oil and gas to be recovered. ""I think, as an industry, it's the responsibility on all of us to make sure we do everything we can to try and arrest that decline rate, and try and get production levels flat if not coming back up again."" That could come about through the record levels of investment currently taking place. Mr Keiller said the UK remains an attractive place to operate, compared with some other parts of the world, because it takes safety seriously, there's security, a lack of corruption, a reliable legal system and a strong skills base. Wood Group's half-year results, announced in August, sparked a sharp dip in its share price, as the company warned that some parts of its engineering division were not performing as well as expected, particularly in Canada. Mr Keiller said the market was ""particularly jittery at even the slightest hint that there was going to be any interruption to the growth story"". He added: ""But our view is that every time we stand in front of the market, we need to be brutally honest, and sometimes that'll be about being more optimistic, and sometimes less optimistic.""

Michael Gove accuses Sussex council of 'academy fail',"In a letter sent to all East Sussex MPs, Michael Gove asked them to persuade the council to ""take a more constructive position"". He criticised the council for ""failing actively to pursue sponsored academy solutions"". East Sussex County Council chiefs described the letter as ""baffling"". The letter from Mr Gove said academies had successfully taken over failing schools across the country and there was ""a wealth of evidence"" that the academy model was working. Council 'now failing' But he said: ""Unfortunately, this transformative drive has not taken root in East Sussex, where too many schools continue to underperform. This is particularly the case for primary schools."" And he added: ""One of the main barriers to progress has been the position of the council. ""It has in the past worked well with officials to find sponsored academy solutions for four underperforming primary schools, but is now failing actively to pursue sponsored academy solutions for others."" Ending the letter, he said he believed discussions would be more productive if MPs were able to persuade the council to take ""a more constructive position"". Matt Dunkley, director of children's services for the county council, said he found the letter ""baffling"" particularly because he had met Mr Gove on Thursday and the MP had made no mention of this. He said: ""It is completely inaccurate for the government to describe us as a barrier to progress, or indeed to suggest that we are resistant to schools becoming academies."" Lewes Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said he had received the letter but said he felt it should be up to local people to make decisions about how their children should be educated. 'No sponsors' Mr Dunkley said the council was the co-sponsor of three academies in East Sussex. He also said the council and the Department for Education (DfE) brokered sponsors for four primary academies last year. He said: ""We have been in dialogue with the government about a number of underperforming primary schools in recent months. ""When we discussed academy options for those schools, the DfE said it did not have appropriate available sponsors at present for all the schools concerned. ""So we discussed instead alternative improvement plans for each of those schools. ""It was only in the past week that the government told us they would prefer us to pursue academy status as an option for these schools.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The consequences of a busy day,"Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The day before Liverpool had won the Carling Cup football final, while the Sun on Sunday had just been launched. For the NHS, it was to be the busiest day of the year. The bed occupancy rate nationally was 92% - seven percentage points above the recognised safe level - according to an analysis by monitoring body Dr Foster. Nearly half of the 145 trusts in England reported a bed occupancy rate of 95% or above. There is nothing to suggest anything specific went wrong that day. But what is certain is that staff working on the wards of hospitals up and down the country would have been struggling to keep up. Quality of care When bed occupancy tips the 85% mark the system goes into overdrive - and things start to give. For patients that means quality of care may suffer. They may have to wait that little bit longer before their call bell is answered. There may not be enough staff to help the frail at meal times. Discharge planning can go awry as hospitals become desperate to free up beds. That can mean they turf people out before they are ready or before the support in the community from district nursing teams and social care is in place. Because of the shortage of beds, patients can find themselves moved around from ward to ward, inevitably finding themselves in unsuitable surroundings. On their own, these things seem relatively minor, but added together they create the sort of care that leaves people feeling aggrieved and which, at its worse, is unsafe. It is these sorts of lapses that have been highlighted in critical reports by both the Patients Association and Care Quality Commission in recent weeks. What the Dr Foster analysis illustrates is why the NHS struggles and how then a culture that is not conducive to what ministers like to call ""patient-centred"" care develops. Patient groups have been more blunt. The Patients Association described the report as ""distressing"", while Michelle Mitchell, of Age UK, said such overcrowding was creating a situation whereby the chances of older patients receiving high quality care was ""stacked against them"". There is ever mounting evidence the NHS is under strain and many are arguing it will not take much for the wheels to come off.

Military Wives Choirs and The Hepworth Wakefield get share of Â£76m fund,"Whitby's Gothic Festival, London's Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall are also set to benefit. The latest raft of grants, for 588 organisations, will come out of the wider Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund. It follows Monday's Â£257m injection, which helped The Cavern Club and LSO. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that Saturday's new round of ""vital funding"" would go to ""protect cultural gems across the country, save jobs and prepare the arts to bounce back"". It will cover comedy clubs, circuses, festivals, regional theatres and local museums, across England. ""These awards build on our commitment to be here for culture in every part of the country,"" he added. While July's announcement of the wider support package was welcomed by the arts and entertainment industries, Mr Dowden did admit that it would not be enough to save every job or cultural establishment. 'Stronger together through music' The Military Wives Choir rose to fame through the BBC documentary series with Gareth Malone and was recently the subject of a film starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan. Director Melanie Nightingale said they were ""incredibly grateful"" for the ""much-needed support,"" at a time when many arts organisations have been struggling due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are thrilled that this funding enables our 73 choirs to sing, share and support one another and feel stronger together through music,"" she said. The grants of under Â£1m have also been awarded to the West End's longest running play, The Mousetrap; the Shangri-La stage at Glastonbury Festival; and grassroots music venues, including Night & Day Cafe. Jennifer Smithson, director of the latter Manchester venue, explained that the financial help ""enables us to plan for the future when we look forward to having live music back at the venue once again"". Joe Wright, who directed films including Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, is also a Kneehigh associate. He said he was delighted the Cornwall theatre had been successful in round two, and will now be able to reopen in December with the aim of providing safe, socially distanced outdoor artistic experiences. ""Kneehigh remain an inspiration for many throughout the sector, they've never got 'stuck' and have always been quick to adapt to new challenges,"" he said. ""Their mission to remain local whilst telling stories that reflect all our lives is vital in helping us all through these unprecedented times."" Further round of funding from the Cultural Recovery Fund pot are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.

East of England Ambulance Service vehicle staffing 'a challenge',"The additional vehicles were brought in following patient and staff feedback to identify where more ambulances might be needed. The trust said it would be reliant on staff overtime for the extra ambulances until more staff had been recruited. The EEAS has been criticised in the past for poor response times. A spokesman said: ""The extra ambulances are in operation as and when we have the staff to occupy them. ""The extra ambulances have all been delivered to their stations, but we are finding it a real challenge at the moment to fill all the shifts because we are reliant on staff overtime until our new recruits are on board over the coming few weeks."" 'Tired and fed-up' The trust is recruiting 75 new paramedics and 124 care assistants. Neil Storey, director of emergency operations at EEAS, said: ""While the additional recruitment is still to come into effect... we do need the help and support of our own staff to cover these vehicles."" Unison's EEAS branch Secretary Gary Applin welcomed the increase in ambulances - which require two members of staff - but said he was not surprised to find not enough staff had come forward to cover shifts. ""They're tired, they're fed up and they've got low morale and I think they've probably heard it all before,"" he said. The new ambulances are based in Beccles, Chelmsford, Cromer, Dereham, Diss, Downham Market, Felixstowe, Huntingdon, Mildenhall, Peterborough, Potter Heigham, Saxmundham, Southend, Sudbury and Weeley. Health minister and North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb, who last week said he had ""real concerns"" about how the East of England Ambulance Trust was run, said he was not surprised that there had been staffing issues with the new ambulances. ""I'm very disappointed but not necessarily surprised,"" he said. ""One would have thought they had got their act together to make sure that they could be brought in to use on time. ""I'm meeting with the chair and the interim chief executive on Thursday and will pursue it with them."" The trust has faced criticism in recent months over failing to meet performance targets. Results of a Care Quality Commission investigation into the trust are due to be published in March.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle,"By Laurence PeterBBC News ""My impression is there is a lot of rowing back,"" Dominic Grieve said. The UK's ruling Conservatives clashed with European judges over a UK ban on prisoners voting and Abu Qatada, a terror suspect who was only deported to Jordan after years of legal wrangling. Mr Grieve, a former Attorney-General, said the convention was a vital tool. ""It's probably the single most effective tool for safeguarding human rights,"" he said. Some European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rulings were mistaken, including the one defending the right of prisoners to vote, he said. But he warned that ""if we quit we'll lose all traction and influence"". It would send the wrong signal to countries like Russia and Turkey, whose violations of the convention generate many of the court's cases, he said. The Strasbourg-based ECHR is not an EU institution. But EU member states have to follow the convention's human rights standards. ""In practical terms you can't be in the EU without being in the convention,"" Mr Grieve said. Conservative tensions A UK withdrawal from the convention could spur the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to widen its own remit, he warned. ECJ rulings - enforcing EU treaty obligations - affect the UK as an EU member state. And the ECJ ""raises far more [legal] difficulties"" than the Strasbourg court, Mr Grieve said. Mr Grieve served in the UK government in 2010-2014, but disagreed with Prime Minister David Cameron and some other senior colleagues over the ECHR. He described Mr Cameron as ""irritated"" by perceived lawyers' interference in the UK government's democratic decision-making. ""I think the PM's personal views on this have a great deal to do with it,"" he said. ""In part this is displacement activity for EU frustrations,"" he said, calling Eurosceptic criticisms of European institutions part of a general ""crisis in our parliamentary sovereignty"". He was speaking at a London briefing organised by the Association of European Journalists. Key UK role In 2012 Mr Cameron said the concept of human rights was being ""distorted"" and even ""discredited"" by some ECHR decisions. The Conservatives have called for a British bill of rights to replace the Human Rights Act, which enshrined the convention in UK law in 2000. But now, Mr Grieve said, the government ""wants to tweak the Human Rights Act text, rather than the convention itself"". The UK was instrumental in setting up the court and convention after the gross human rights abuses of World War Two. The Strasbourg judges' decisions are binding on the 47 states that are in the Council of Europe, the top European human rights watchdog. However, Mr Grieve said that the ECHR ""is not a final court of appeal"" - it is still up to national courts to resolve human rights cases. The ECHR still has a backlog of some 63,000 cases to deal with - though back in 2012 the figure was 150,000, Mr Grieve said. He said the court's capacity was about 2,000 judgements annually.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of wife's murder,"Mitesh Patel, 37, denied killing Jessica, 34, and staging a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough. Teesside Crown Court heard he had planned to claim a Â£2m life insurance payout and move to Australia with lover Dr Amit Patel. Jurors returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for three hours. He will be sentenced on Wednesday. The two-week trial heard Patel had a series of affairs with men he met via the dating app Grindr. Patel had claimed he had returned home to find the couple's house burgled and his wife's wrists bound with duct tape. But prosecutors said he had tied her up after injecting her with insulin. Nicholas Campbell QC said: ""The prosecution case was that a plastic shopping bag, ironically a Tesco Bag For Life, was used both as a ligature and to suffocate her."" Patel was secretly in a relationship with his ""soulmate"", a doctor who had emigrated to Sydney and with whom he hoped to bring up his and Jessica's IVF baby after her death. The jury heard Patel had made internet searches dating back years, including ""I need to kill my wife"", ""insulin overdose"", ""plot to kill my wife, do I need a co-conspirator?"", ""hiring hitman UK"" and ""how much methadone will kill you?"". Detectives used Patel's iPhone health app to help convict him, in what is thought to be a legal first in the UK. Motion processors in the phone keep track of a user's steps and when the device is taken upstairs. Data on the app showed Patel went upstairs to ransack rooms in an attempt to stage a break-in after he had strangled his wife in the living room. It also showed that after he returned from a shopping trip that night, he went upstairs after pretending to find his wife's body in order to hide a CCTV hard drive in a clothes-filled suitcase. Mr Justice Goss told the jury a life sentence was mandatory and he would determine Patel's minimum term behind bars. In a statement, Mrs Patel's family said they had been ""devastated"" by her death. They said: ""She had simple dreams, all she ever wanted was to fall in love, have a family of her own and live happily ever after. ""The man we welcomed into our family, who promised to look after and protect her, betrayed her in every sense of the word, cheating her of her dreams, robbing her of her life and robbing us of her."" Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Matt Murphy-King said evidence had emerged to show Patel ""had researched and planned Jess's death for a number of years"". Staging the burglary was ""one of the many lies which Mitesh spun to conceal his guilt and devious lifestyle"", he said. ""Whilst nothing can be done to bring Jess back or lessen the pain and suffering caused to Jess's family, I sincerely hope that by bringing Mitesh Patel to justice for his despicable crime it at least brings some solace to them.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tourists in trainers rescued in Ben Nevis blizzard,"They said the tourists who were caught in blizzard conditions had ""no ice axes, no crampons and as far as we are aware, no maps"". Three of them were wearing trainers. Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team found them near the summit of the mountain. All four were taken by helicopter from part-way down the mountain to be checked over at Belford Hospital in Fort William. Inverness Coastguard helicopter, Rescue 151, could not be used near the summit because of the severity of the conditions. 'Very, very cold' Miller Harris, of Lochaber MRT, said the four people who were visiting Scotland from abroad were lucky to have been at a place on the mountain where they could get mobile phone reception. They were able to raise the alarm by calling the police and then use an app to give rescuers a location ""within metres"" of where they were. Mr Harris told BBC Scotland: ""If there hadn't been a phone signal, we would have had no idea what was going on. ""One of them managed to get back to the summit where they met our team and was able to confirm the location where his friends were. ""They were very, very cold and one was probably hypothermic and was having difficulty walking."" Mr Harris said the people were on a day trip, rather than being experienced hillwalkers, and had no winter equipment such as ice axes or crampons and did not appear to have a map. Lochaber MRT described the weather as ""horrendous"" with the wind chill of -20C or below. The rescue on Britain's highest mountain came in the wake of Storm Ciara and amid Met Office yellow ""be aware"" warnings of high winds and snow. The group used the app What3words to give a location ""within metres"" of where rescuers found them. The app divides the world into three-metre squares and gives each one a unique three-word address. Tortoises, swarm and announce were the words given for the group of four on Ben Nevis, according to the What3words website. In Scotland, it has previously been used in the rescue of an injured walker in Lewis in the Western Isles. Mountaineering groups suggest the app be used in addition to but not instead of map and compass and other winter skills. Mr Harris backed that advice, adding: ""We are not saying that people should not go out on the mountains. People with the right skills and equipment are able to do that safely.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stormont deadlock: Sinn FÃ©in to meet Leo Varadkar,"Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said she will tell the British and Irish governments this week that ""direct rule from London is not an option"". Talks to restore the Stormont assembly collapsed on Wednesday. Both Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP had engaged in negotiations in a bid to end a 13-month impasse at Stormont. Ms McDonald and Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill are expected to meet Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney in Dublin. Sinn FÃ©in is expected to meet the prime minister Theresa May in London later in the week. Ms McDonald has said the party still believes a restoration of devolution is possible and will be calling on the two governments to convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to avoid a prolonged stalemate. She has also appealed to the DUP to return to the talks. ""Michelle and I will be telling the taoiseach and the British Prime Minister it is the responsibility of the two governments to implement the agreements on legacy and an Irish language act and to provide for marriage equality,"" Ms McDonald said. ""We will also make it clear to both government that a return to direct rule from London is not an option. ""Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to working for an agreement. However, any return to talks must be progressive and ultimately they must deliver for citizens."" Sinn FÃ©in has accused the DUP of collapsing the talks and party leader Ms McDonald has claimed a draft deal was in place earlier this month, which included an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act and a respecting language and diversity act. She said Sinn FÃ©in warned the DUP to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it. DUP leader Arlene Foster said last week there was ""no current prospect"" of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland. She said talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Mrs Foster also said no draft agreement was in place. ""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement because they were insisting on having this free-standing Irish language act,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus in NI care homes a 'critical battle' for executive,"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter On Friday it emerged some residents were being moved from a north Belfast care home due to concerns about its handling of an outbreak. Almost half of the 664 Covid-linked deaths recorded by NI's statistics agency, Nisra, occurred in care homes. Speaking in a joint interview on Sky News, Arlene Foster said care homes had always been a focus for the executive. The first minister said the Department of Health had been planning to make sure it could deal with care home outbreaks, alongside hospital transmissions of the virus. ""We have made many interventions in our private care home sector as well,"" she said. ""The whole executive acknowledges care homes are a critical battle for us now and we want to deal with it in a very proactive way."" Last week, the Department of Health said testing on all care home residents will be completed by the end of June. On Sunday, one further coronavirus-related death in Northern Ireland was reported by the Department of Health (DoH). Its total now stands at 506 which are mostly focused on hospital deaths. Weekly figures released by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) cover all fatalities where coronavirus has been recorded on the death certificate. Their figures recorded 664 deaths by 15 May, almost half of which happened in care homes. 'Working together to save lives' Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she believed tackling the pandemic had brought the Stormont parties closer together. ""In so far as we're having to work around the clock to take this on,"" said Ms O'Neill. ""There's been differences in emphasis but not differences in approach. We were thrust into this but executive colleagues have worked closely together to save lives"". Both ministers said they had also felt the strain of the pandemic affecting their normal lives. Ms O'Neill said as political leaders, they had given up much ""family time"". ""We're no different to anybody else, we find it as hard as everybody else,"" said the deputy first minister. ""Our reality is the same as everybody else's."" Mrs Foster said she missed the ""ordinary things we take for granted"", like going to church and getting her hair cut. ""I hope after this that people do value their freedom and all these things they haven't been able to do over the past eight weeks,"" she added. The first steps to ease lockdown in Northern Ireland took effect last week. The executive is next due to review the lockdown regulations by 28 May, but it has not put a timetable into its five-step pathway to recovery for Northern Ireland.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Rower, 72, set to become oldest to cross Atlantic","Graham Walters, from Thurmaston in Leicestershire, is raising money for Help for Heroes by rowing from Gran Canaria to Antigua. This is his fifth Atlantic crossing, the fourth in the boat hand-built in his garden 22 years ago. Mr Walters has to time his landing to fit in with a coronavirus curfew. Mr Walters set off from Gran Canaria on 25 January for the 3,000-mile trip and has faced rough seas, a broken water maker and a hammerhead shark paying him close attention. While aware of the coronavirus pandemic, his support team said he was not fully aware of its impact until approaching land, when he is having to time his arrival to obey a curfew in Antigua. Mr Walters has promised this will be his last crossing and hopes the boat will go into a museum in Antigua. The record is currently held by Gerard Marie of France, who completed the solo challenge in 2015 at the age of 66 years and 323 days. The boat is called the George Geary, after Mr Walker's grandfather, who was a cricketer for Leicestershire and England. Help for Heroes said he chose to fundraise for the charity after helping several wounded veterans, who were taking part in a previous Atlantic rowing race, when he was on a support boat. Impressed by their determination, he decided to do a final crossing raising funds for sick veterans. His wife, Jean, 62, said: ""Graham has always been an adventurer, so he's had it in his mind for a while now to do one 'final journey'. ""To complete the challenge and take the record will be a massive personal achievement for him."" David Martin, from Help for Heroes, said: ""Few of us would attempt such a challenge in the first flush of youth - let alone in our 70s. ""Injuries have ended 40,000 military careers in 20 years and every day this number grows, so his donations will help us ensure that we can be there to support them, whenever they need us.""

Seychelles protects an area 'as big as Britain' in Indian Ocean,"In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off, the island nation has agreed to protect 210,000 sq km (81,000 sq miles) of ocean. The reserves will limit tourism and fishing activities in the Seychelles to halt further damage to aquatic life. A foundation set up by actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the investors that worked on the deal. The Oscar winner said: ""This effort will help the people of Seychelles protect their ocean for future generations, and will serve as a model for future marine conservation projects worldwide."" Seychelles President Danny Faure said: ""Our large ocean brings development opportunities but also responsibility. ""By planning properly to protect our environment, we can be sure we are also protecting our people and their livelihoods against an uncertain future. "" What is the deal? This is understood to be the first debt swap designed to protect ocean areas in the world. The Seychelles government agreed the debt swap with the Nature Conservancy, a US charity, and a number of investors back in 2016. Under the terms of the $21m (Â£15m) deal, the charity and the investors - including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation - paid for a portion of the Seychelles national debt. The country will then direct future national debt payments into a new trust, the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT). This trust will offer lower interest rates on debt repayments, and any savings will go to fund new projects designed to protect marine life and handle the effects of climate change. What will be protected? The Seychelles is raising the percentage of its protected waters from 0.04% to 30% by 2020 as part of the agreement. This first part of the plan creates two new marine parks. The first covers the Aldabra islands, home to hundreds of thousands of tortoises, nesting bird colonies, and the dugong - one of the more endangered species in the Indian Ocean. This area will be fully protected, with only research and regulated tourism allowed. The second area concerns the seas around the Seychelles' main islands and will limit the fishing and tourism activities there. ""This is a critical accomplishment in our mission to bring conservation to scale across the globe,"" said Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek. ""What you see today in Seychelles is what we expect to introduce in the Caribbean and other ocean regions facing the threats of climate change.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rise in ambulance delays at South East hospitals,"South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) figures show ambulances had 36,000 hours ""handover time"" in 2011/12, 50% more than three years ago. The College of Paramedics said it was a major risk to patient safety. James Pavey, from SECAmb, said the service was working with hospitals to reduce any delays in admitting patients to hospitals. ""We've seen this hospital handover delay problem growing over the last few years,"" he said. 'Extreme times' ""This has a knock-on effect, so if we're waiting at a hospital to hand over our patient, we're not out providing the pre-hospital care."" He said the usual handover time was 15 minutes, but paramedics had ""seen delays at extreme times of two to three hours"". Ambulances arriving at the Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford have seen average waiting times double in the last two years, with almost 5% of patients waiting more than an hour before being admitted. The hospital said: ""There has been a general increase in A&E attendances and a very busy period in February 2012. ""The average number of ambulance attendances at A&E rose from 65 per day in February 2011 to 72 per day in February 2012."" Handover times at the East Surrey Hospital in Redhill have more than doubled over the two years with just under 10% of patients waiting more than an hour. But at the Conquest hospital in Hastings, waiting times have fallen. 'Dangerous situation' A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: ""Everyone deserves to be seen quickly when they arrive at hospital. It is unacceptable for patients to be left waiting in ambulances outside the hospital in order to avoid waiting time targets. ""That's why we have changed the system and introduced new measures to ensure patients are seen quickly. ""Hospitals need to ensure they have proper plans in place to deal with high demand and we are doing everything we can to support them in treating patients as swiftly as they can."" Howard Catton, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: ""We are seeing an increase in demand at accident and emergency. Hospitals are often running at virtually full capacity. ""You need to have some free beds so you don't have a log jam."" The College of Paramedics, which represents ambulance crews, said: ""Some members have stated that they feel the situation is dangerous on occasions and is unsustainable due to the extra operational burden it places on ambulance services. ""The college feels that situations like this present unacceptable levels of risk and is not only worried about patient safety but is also concerned about the welfare and stress this situation places on paramedics and other pre-hospital clinicians.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina resigns,"Prosecutors accuse Mr Perez Molina of masterminding a scheme to defraud the customs service of millions of dollars. He denies the allegations. On Tuesday, Congress stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, a first in the Central American nation. A spokesman said Mr Perez Molina had decided to step down to ""confront the proceedings against him"". Bribery allegations Mr Perez Molina's resignation comes just days before Sunday's presidential election, in which he was barred from standing under constitutional rules. Analysis: Katy Watson, BBC News, Central America correspondent For weeks now Guatemalans have been chanting ""fuera"" (out). They shouted because more than anything they wanted President Perez Molina to resign. They were outraged at these most recent corruption scandals and while corruption has always been present - and even tolerated - in Guatemala, people had had enough. Their voices have now been heard. Guatemalans feel this is their moment, that for once they have been listened to. On a day that until recently they never thought they would see, people on the streets feel empowered. Vice-President Alejandro Maldonado is expected to govern until the new president is sworn in on 14 January. Mr Maldonado has only been in the post since mid-May, when his predecessor Roxana Baldetti resigned. Ms Baldetti is accused of involvement in the same corruption scheme which Mr Perez Molina allegedly masterminded. Investigators say the scheme, dubbed La Linea, or The Line, involved businesses paying bribes to government officials and custom officers in return for being allowed to evade import duties. Mass protests The corruption scandal has triggered a series of mass protests in Guatemala and widespread calls for Mr Perez Molina to resign. But until Wednesday night, the president had stood firm, saying he would serve out his term. His spokesman said Mr Perez Molina had handed in his letter of resignation just before midnight local time. Congress still has to approve his resignation before it comes into force. Local media said Mr Perez Molina's current whereabouts were unknown. On Tuesday, a judge barred him from leaving the country ""as a precautionary measure"".

MP Nigel Evans sex abuse trial hears 'Benny Hill' claim,"The Ribble Valley MP said claims he sexually abused men were ""ridiculous"", but had effectively ended his ambitions of becoming House of Commons speaker. The 56-year-old was being cross-examined by prosecution barrister Mark Heywood QC at Preston Crown Court. Mr Evans denies rape, two indecent assaults and six sexual assaults. 'Own free will' He is alleged to have committed the offences between 2002 and last year. Mr Heywood questioned Mr Evans about the alleged rape of a 22-year-old man after a dinner party at the MP's home in Pendleton, Lancashire last March. Mr Evans told the prosecutor he initiated kissing and cuddling downstairs before they went to his bedroom ""both of their own free will"". The barrister accused him of taking advantage of the alleged victim, to which the MP said: ""No, not at all."" Mr Heywood said the young man said he was tired, but Mr Evans said he could not recall this. The barrister then said the MP recommended sexual activity and the man was passive. Mr Evans denied it, and later said: ""What did he expect when we both got into the bed in our underwear when there were two other bedrooms? ""We both entered my bedroom of our own free will and we had consensual sex."" 'Bizarre to bunkum' Referring to two allegations that Mr Evans had placed his hand in the trousers of men in public, Mr Heywood asked him: ""There is evidence in each of these two incidents that what took place was without any eye contact. ""Was this you using hands where words were not available to you?"" Mr Evans replied: ""No. It is trying to make me out to be a cross between Alan Clark, Benny Hill and Oscar Wilde. It's ridiculous."" The court heard the MP had no recollection of the two events, one alleged to have taken place in a bar in Soho, London, in late 2002 or early 2003 and the other at the Imperial Hotel bar at the 2003 Conservative Party conference in Blackpool. He denied he had made a pass on those occasions, and also when with a young man at the Houses of Parliament in 2009. Mr Evans is alleged to have leaned forward to kiss the man behind a curtain near the Strangers Bar. The MP said it ""goes from the bizarre to the bunkum"" that he would do that. Neutral role The jury heard him also deny allegations he ""cupped"" the genitals of another man shortly after being introduced to him in Strangers Bar. Mr Evans said: ""With several people watching? No."" The MP also denied sexually assaulting a Westminster worker in a kitchen near his deputy speaker's offices last March. Mr Evans was a Conservative MP before becoming deputy speaker in June 2010, a politically-neutral role. He has not returned to the Conservatives in the Commons and is representing his constituents as an independent. The trial continues on Thursday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore',"Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, said: ""I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing."" Boeing is fighting for its reputation while the 737 Max remains grounded. A company spokesman said: ""The safety of passengers and crews flying on our aircraft is our absolute priority."" He said: ""We are truly sorry and we continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the accidents of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. ""We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the 737 Max is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly."" Ms Kuria met with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with other family members who lost loved ones, to gain reassurances that the Boeing 737 Max will not return to the skies until rigorous tests are carried out. The British woman's father, Joseph Waithaka, died with 156 others on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March. It was the second crash involving a Boeing 737 Max following the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which killed all 189 people onboard. ""They are not trustworthy anymore - if they had been in the past,"" Ms Kuria said. She said the EASA's executive director Patrick Ky had reassured her that ""he would not be caving"" to either the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, or Boeing in terms of reclassifying whether the 737 Max is safe for European air travel. Boeing is hoping that the FAA will allow the Max back into the air in the early part of next year but the FAA's close relationship with Boeing has been under intense scrutiny. It recently emerged that the FAA allowed the 737 Max to keep flying after the first disaster in October last year despite knowing there was a risk of further crashes. Ms Kuria said: ""I think the more discovery is done, the more reason we are finding not to trust [Boeing] when it comes to the 737 Max. ""There are so many things that were hidden that shouldn't have been, so many things that were bypassed that shouldn't have been and I think every time we sit down and have a hearing or hear from an aviation authority on documents of discovery we just find out how preventable the death of our loved ones was."" Mr Ky said that the European regulator will ""take their time to recertify"" the plane. Ms Kuria also said her safety concerns not only relate to the plane's automated flight control system which malfunctioned before both crashes but other critical safety systems on board the 737 Max. During the meeting, EASA said ""they would reassess all the critical safety systems that are on the 737 Max"", according to Ms Kuria.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Peter Sutcliffe victim highlights 'imbalance of justice' for women,"Mo Lea, 61, from Bedford, was an art student in Leeds in 1980 when she was attacked by a man with a hammer. She has been named as one of the likely victims of Sutcliffe, but no charges were brought before his death in 2020. Ms Lea's animated image of Lady Justice emptying her scales has been beamed onto the Houses of Parliament. Sutcliffe was convicted on 22 May 1981 of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. He died at a hospital in County Durham in November 2020, aged 74, while serving a whole-life term at the maximum security Frankland jail. A report in 1982 by Sir Lawrence Byford, which was only made public in 2006, found Sutcliffe could have been responsible for 13 more offences. Ms Lea was named in redacted parts of the Byford Report, which made a string of recommendations to West Yorkshire Police, but no further charges were brought against Sutcliffe despite a reinvestigation. To mark the 40th anniversary of Sutcliffe's conviction, an animation by Ms Lea, showing the famous Lady Justice statue pouring out female gender symbols from the scales of justice, was projected onto the Houses of Parliament, where the Byford Report remains in the library. Ms Lea said the animation represented ""the negative imbalance of justice towards women"". ""The art projection raises the question, asking what progress has been made in the police and legal systems to support women who have been victims of violent attacks. ""This represents the negative imbalance of justice towards women,"" she said. The women murdered by Peter Sutcliffe Ms Lea, author of Facing the Yorkshire Ripper: The Art Of Survival, said recent events such as the Me Too movement and the death of Sarah Everard showed the ""dismissive"" attitude towards female victims and ""prevailing misogyny"". She said: ""It's a call to educate the police in their training courses to improve their response when females make allegations of attacks.

Greggs profits set to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels,"The bakery chain said sales had seen a ""strong recovery"" since non-essential shops reopened in April. While it warned that trading conditions were ""clearly highly unusual"", it said profits this year could much higher than previously forecast. Retailer Hotel Chocolat also said sales had been ""encouraging"" since shops began to reopen. It added that profits for the year to the end of June were likely to be ""significantly ahead of expectations"". Hotel Chocolat also said that, as a results of its successful trading, it would repay Â£3,1m of furlough funding it has received from the government. Improved outlook In March, Greggs reported its first full year loss in 36 years after battling a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. It had said previously that it did not expect profits to return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest. However, trading this year has been better than expected, and in its latest update Greggs said it ""saw a significant pick up in sales with the reopening of non-essential retail from 12 April, in part reflecting the pent-up demand for retail which has boosted High Street footfall"". While sales have recovered well in recent weeks, it noted that as coronavirus restrictions continue to relax it will face more competition from cafes and restaurants with indoor seating. Nevertheless, Greggs said if restrictions ease in line with current plans ""then we now expect our overall sales performance for the year to be stronger than we had previously anticipated"". ""However, given our recent trading performance, the board now believes that profits are likely to be materially higher than its previous expectation, and could be around 2019 levels in the absence of further restrictions,"" the bakery chain said. Whereas like-for-like sales were down more than a fifth in the 10 weeks to 13 March compared with 2019, they were down less than 4% in the eight weeks to 8 May. Delivery sales had helped Greggs to regain lost ground, it said. Greggs compared current trading with 2019 rather than 2020 because in that year it was ""severely"" hit by temporary shop closures. In the first 18 weeks of the year it opened 34 new shops, including 13 franchises, and closed 11, giving a total of 2,101 shops trading as of 8 May. Chocolate bounce Retailers and financial firms have been noting a boost in shopping since non-essential shops could reopen in April, and have been cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the UK economy. But some saw a pick-up in trade before that. Chocolatier Hotel Chocolat said it had a strong Mother's Day and Easter despite its physical shops being closed, with revenue up 60% in the eight-week period to 25 April. This year it looks forward to ""strong job creation, particularly in our UK chocolate making and supply teams."" It said would start making more of its vegan Nutmilk chocolate, macarons, and its Velvetiser drinking chocolate flakes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry move into tier 2,"Restrictions came into force at 00:01 BST on Saturday. Slough has also moved into the tier two ""high"" category. The restrictions in tier two mean households can no longer mix indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Stoke-on-Trent would move up a tier on Thursday, while Coventry announced the same move earlier in the week. However, there are exemptions for childcare and support bubbles. Michelle Swift runs Swifty's, a micro pub in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, which she has to temporarily close due to the new restrictions. ""When we first opened we were limited to the rule of six, we could work with that,"" she said. ""It wasn't the same as what it used to be but it was manageable."" Now she can only have seven tables, which, if customers come alone, could mean just seven customers. ""It just doesn't make sense. We're near the border with Staffordshire County Council so you can go a mile up the road and you can sit with your friends in another pub,"" she said. Ms Swift also said the guidance on enforcing the restrictions was ""not that clear"" and therefore left ""open to interpretation"". ""You're literally the fun police and you're on edge all the time because your licence is at risk,"" she said. Stoke-on-Trent City Council leader Abi Brown said taking the approach now would limit the damage to the local economy ahead of any potential move to the ""very high"" category. ""I'm not willing to put the lives of Stoke-on-Trent residents at risk by dithering for a week when we can act now to save lives and minimise economic damage,"" she said. The council applied to the government to be put into the higher measures as it said the city had seen a sharp increase in cases over the last few days. Dr Paul Edmondson-Jones, director of adult social care and health, said this would continue to accelerate unless urgent action was taken. The council leader in Coventry, George Duggins, said the city had to work to get back to tier one as soon as possible. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Budget 2020: The chancellor's very large cheque book,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Rishi Sunak has barely been in one of the biggest jobs in the country for a month. But the chancellor certainly found his stride as the astonishing scale of the government's first Budget became clear. First off, a Â£30bn stimulus for the economy, in particular the emergency with the coronavirus crisis - a mixture of extra cash for the health service, loan guarantees, abolishing business rates for some firms this year and a promise that the government will pick up the significant cost of sick pay for small firms, if their workers have to stay at home because of the illness. That is an enormous amount of money by any measure, accompanied by a promise that there is more where that came from if needs be. And it was not just the urgent requirements of the unfolding coronavirus that caused the chancellor to get out a very large cheque book. As expected, he outlined a generational change in the rate of spending on the bricks and mortar of the public realm, Â£175bn more than planned before the election. He promised more money for the NHS, for further education, for housing. There was a huge uplift in the amount the government spends on research and development, along with the announcement of the dream of the prime minister's controversial adviser Dominic Cummings, who has long argued for an agency like ARPA - the US Advanced Research Projects Agency. And to please the new Tory MPs in the hope of pleasing their new voters, there were expected measures to try to even out the lopsided nature of the economy. It seemed at times like it was raining cash. There is a BIG but. The government not surprisingly didn't fancy making any big tax rises either, so the new chancellor had to find all that cash somewhere else. Where? In an absolutely enormous new national overdraft. Long gone are the days when the Conservatives preached fiscal rectitude as their priority. The scale of the spending and borrowing announced today would be the stuff of a 2010 George Osborne's nightmares. The Tories have been drifting away from that ideology for some time, but today the new chancellor buried it several feet under. Labour can argue with deep frustration that the Conservatives are new converts to the cause, that borrowing to spend on what the country needs is the right way to look after the economy. But with a potential economic and health emergency on coronavirus and a deep political ambition, their cries, of ""we told you so"", won't bother the Tories much, at least for now. PS - Keep an eye out though. As with any Budget, a huge amount of information suddenly emerges, and it takes time to plough through the numbers and the black and white of what's been announced. Surprises may emerge in the coming hours.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Astronaut Scott Kelly attacked for quoting Winston Churchill,"American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. But when Kelly tried to apologise for the tweet and offered to educate himself, Churchill fans attacked him for discrediting the politician's record. Kelly, whose sister-in-law is former Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, used a famous remark by Churchill to comment on deep divisions in American politics. The wartime leader wrote ""In victory, magnanimity"" in his book about World War Two to refer to the need for winners of a conflict to show grace. Kelly added: ""I guess those days are over"". But Churchill is also known for quotes like ""I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place"", in reference to indigenous populations of North America and Australia. Kelly's Twitter followers also linked Churchill to a famine in Bengal, India, that killed at least three million people in 1943. Kelly quickly apologised for the offence caused, writing that he would educate himself on Churchill's ""atrocities and racist views"". He added that his point was that Americans should not let politics divide the nation. But he was swiftly attacked by Churchill fans for calling the leader racist. They suggested those views were standard in the mid-20th Century. ""Please read a good biography of Churchill before making pronouncements on his 'atrocities' and 'racist views'. He committed no atrocities and his views on race 100-years ago cannot be judged by today's standards - generational chauvinism,"" wrote Twitter user Paul Reid. ""We can't judge historical figures based on modern sensitivities; no one would come out unscathed. Adjusting history to our modern perception is unfair to the times & circumstances that preceded us,"" commented another. In just two tweets, Kelly wrote another social media rule - never quote Winston Churchill. You might also like: By Georgina Rannard, UGC & Social news",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Shrewsbury 24': MPs vote for release of government papers,"Campaigners want to quash convictions against 24 men who were accused of violent picketing and intimidating workers in Shropshire, in 1972. MPs voted by 120 to three to call on the government to release the papers. Campaigners say the men have been victims of a miscarriage of justice. The ""Shrewsbury 24"" were arrested five months after the 1972 building workers' strike and charged under the 1875 Conspiracy Act. Eileen Turnbull, from the Shrewsbury 24 campaign group, told BBC News after the vote, led by Labour MP Dave Anderson, that holding it was ""absolutely right"". 'It was ludicrous' She said: ""This case is 41 years old. To have a vote of such magnitude in the House, it's absolutely right. ""All we are asking for is to release the documents... not asking to debate the issue, it has taken us 40 years for them to vote."" She said she hoped the government who ""came in with a policy of transparency"" would now release the papers. ""We are looking forward to obtaining these documents hopefully in the next few weeks."" Speaking on Wednesday, ahead of the vote, Tomlinson told BBC Look North about his arrest and the subsequent effect it had on him. ""They [the police] came one night as my wife was bathing the two lads in front of the fire. ""I was whizzed off to the local police station and because I had never been in trouble with the police I had no experience of anything like this, I was appalled. ""We were taken in a van to Shrewsbury with police in front and behind, police cars with Alsatian dogs and motorbike out-riders. ""Got to the police station in Shrewsbury, we were fingerprinted, photographed, it was surreal, absolutely surreal and to find out I had 21 charges against me for doing everything bar robbing the crown jewels - it was ludicrous. ""We have got to have our names clearedâ¦ we have got to have everything squashed. ""I would like to see some of those people responsible, I would like to see them named and shamed because it was appalling."" He said he did think the group would get justice. ""It had a devastating effect on us. It was responsible - not solely for the break-up of my marriage but it played a big part in it.""

Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail,"Maplin, which has more than 200 stores and 2,300 staff, will continue to trade through the process. The business faced the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote, weak consumer confidence and a withdrawal of credit insurance. These factors made it ""impossible"" to raise capital, boss Graham Harris said. The news came shortly after retailer Toys R Us went into administration. ""We believe passionately that Maplin has a place on the High Street and that our trust, credibility and expertise meets a customer need that is not supported elsewhere,"" Mr Harris said. Maplin will now work with administrators PwC ""to achieve the best possible outcome for all of our colleagues and stakeholders"", Mr Harris added. PwC said it would ""explore all opportunities to find a new owner"". Stores will open as normal during this time, and there are no plans to close shops or make redundancies at the moment, PwC said. Any outstanding customer orders will be delivered, while gift cards will continue to be accepted in stores for the present, it added. Mail order Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ""The challenging conditions in the UK retail sector are well documented. ""Like many other retailers, Maplin has been hit hard by a slowdown in consumer spending and more expensive imports as the pound has weakened,"" he said. ""Staff have been paid their February wages and will continue to be paid for future work while the company is in administration."" Maplin has 2,335 staff, 217 stores and an annual turnover of Â£235.8m. It operates in the UK and Ireland and has head offices in London and Rotherham. It began as a mail-order business in 1972, providing electronic components to hobbyists. Maplin opened its first shop in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex in 1976. After changing hands several times, the chain has been owned by Rutland Partners since 2014. Potential buyers had included Edinburgh Woollen Mill, the clothing company that owns Peacocks, Country Casuals and several other retailers. However, talks are understood to have broken down. High Street chains have been badly affected by lower consumer spending, higher inflation and competition from online rivals.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Colchester Hospital: Police launch formal inquiry,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said earlier this month Colchester Hospital staff were ""pressured or bullied"" to change data. Essex Police announced on Tuesday it would be investigating. NHS England also revealed details of a review of all 14 types of cancer pathways at the hospital. The incident management team includes 18 clinicians and a senior police officer, NHS England said. Andrew Pike of NHS England said: ""It's the duty of everyone in the NHS to ensure that we provide safe services."" 'Services safe' He added: ""If we do identify that we need to look at individual notes and deal with individual patients, then they and their family members will be fully involved in any work. There will be no plan to keep this secret at all. ""They must be aware that there has been a problem and be involved. ""Common sense would say once we've got to the bottom of the cancer problem, it would be very sensible to make sure there has been no problems in other areas."" Regulator Monitor placed Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust into special measures following the CQC report published in early November. The inspector said patients' lives may have been put at risk. Essex Police had looked at the data issue and on Tuesday said it warranted a full criminal investigation. Cancer pathways The incident management team involves Monitor, the CQC, Essex Police, and the North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group. It is initially investigating all 14 cancer pathways, with each examined by a cancer specialist, GP, senior nurse, cancer manager and other support staff, and will remain in place ""until all aspects of the incident are resolved and ongoing action plans agreed"". The teams will look at the quality of clinical services, waiting time information, treatment outcomes and the overall organisation of each cancer specialty. If a pathway review team has concerns, it will identify immediate remedial action to make the services safe and indicate if further reform or improvements to services are required, NHS England said. A final report is due to be completed and published by NHS England by mid-December.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tidal energy project proposed off Bardsey Island,"Local community enterprise YnNi Llyn has teamed up with Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation to explore the possibility of deploying a 3MW array of turbines under the water in Bardsey Sound. Some fishermen told Newyddion 9 it could ""devastate"" their livelihoods. But YnNi Llyn said the project would be developed to benefit the local economy. The plans are at an early stage, but an application has been submitted to The Crown Estate to start the process of assessing the feasibility of the project, as well as the suitability of the site near the island, known as Enlli in Welsh. Fisherman Sion Williams said: ""This development, if it were to be placed in this area, would be devastating to the livelihoods of many fishermen. ""We fish with small boats and we can't move areas. This piece of ground is very important to us."" Other fishermen who spoke to the programme said they were confident the company and volunteers would listen to their concerns. YnNi Llyn volunteers said it was too early to estimate how many homes would be powered by the project, but it said Â£5m of local money currently leaves the area in energy bills. Brian Thomas, on behalf of YnNi Llyn, said: ""We are definitely not in the game of undermining, or destroying, or replacing sustainable businesses, quite the opposite. ""Our business is to develop this in a way that is of benefit to the local economy, in terms of individuals and local businesses."" He added that fishermen were ""key to any decision"" and no action would be taken without them being fully aware of the design and location. A spokesperson for Nova Innovation said it was aware of the ""active fishing community"" off Bardsey and had met with the local fishing associations. ""The project partners have agreed to work closely with the associations to ensure that the extent of fishing activity in the area is properly understood and this is firmly factored into the design of the potential project,"" he said. ""If a tidal energy project does go ahead at Enlli, there would be significant potential benefits for the supply chain in north Wales and the local economy."" The Crown Estate said it had accepted the initial application and, following the completion of a three month notice period and consultation, it was now in the final stage of negotiations to enter into an agreement for a lease.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Why Indiaâs mobile users go offline for video,"By Prasanto K RoyTechnology writer It sells odds and ends, and DVD discs, each with up to 10 movies of doubtful quality. Asim Mandal, 26, a checkout clerk at a local retailer, is a regular. He pops out his phone's memory card, and gives it to the shopkeeper who swaps it for an identical 8GB card. On the new card is a recent Bollywood film. It costs Mr Mandal 50 rupees ($0.81; Â£0.52) to get it on his smartphone and that is less than half of a movie-hall ticket. He also gets two older movies as a bonus. The shop can be called a new-age video lending library where enterprising shopkeepers sell phone memory cards preloaded with movies and a few will swap them for your memory card if you are a regular. Mr Mandal hopes to watch the new release on his hour-long metro train ride back to north Delhi, where he shares a room as a paying guest, and on the ride to work the next day. ""It's a good deal,"" he says. ""Though it's twice what I would pay back home in Bihar."" If the movie is good, it gets saved on his external hard disk, via his roommate's laptop loaned in return for a copy of the new release. Or, they might both watch it on the laptop, with cheap external speakers. For his Micromax handset, which he bought for just over 5,000 rupees ($80) last October, Mr Mandal has a mobile connection with Edge (2G data) which is too slow for video. He bought the phone because he wanted a smartphone, mainly for using the messaging service WhatsApp and for watching videos off memory cards. Like Mr Mandal, millions of Indians use their smartphones for consuming video and music offline, rather than downloaded or streamed online. There are five very good reasons for it: Most videos on India's smartphones are unauthorised copies and the loss of revenue is not only for the film industry; mobile operators, too, lose data traffic revenue when videos are copied offline. ""We do get data traffic from video,"" says a manager at a leading mobile operator who does not wish to be identified because she is not authorised to speak to the media. ""But it's mostly videos forwarded over WhatsApp, and some YouTube links shared over WhatsApp or email."" Operators are trying video offerings. Airtel's ""Teramera"" service lets you watch any of 35,000 short videos for a rupee (less than 2 cents). But they have no solution in sight for letting users watch or download movies off air. Even if that changes, offline videos are likely to continue to dominate the small screens of India's mobile generation.

Hospital funding issues put local MPs on the spot,"Patrick BurnsPolitical editor, Midlands The irony is that the private finance initiative was devised by the previous Conservative administration. But it was Labour who adopted it with a will, as a way of replacing crumbling or outdated hospital buildings with gleaming 'superhospitals' including Birmingham's 'new QE' and the Royal Worcestershire Hospital at Ronkswood. And so the wheel of politics goes round and round, because it is now the turn of Conservative MPs to target Labour over what they say is the burden of debts in a lengthening list of NHS trusts caused in no small measure by, you guessed it, PFI projects introduced under Labour. Critics of PFI warned for years these schemes were, in effect, mortgaging the future of the health service. But the chief executive of University Hospitals Birmingham, Dame Julie Moore, replied that many homeowners would consider they had negotiated a very good deal if their mortgage companies agreed to look after their houses, mend their fences and mow their lawns. Now though, comes a further political twist. Many Conservative MPs were elected on a promise to defend their local hospital services. You can see why, after the political trauma in Kidderminster which led to Dr Richard Taylor's election 11 years ago as the Independent MP for Wyre Forest, and the scandal over unexpectedly high death rates at Stafford Hospital which contributed to the downfall there of Labour's David Kidney in Stafford in 2010. But surely the coalition government promised to 'ring fence' NHS budgets, so that question of 'defending hospitals' need not arise? Try saying that to the latest MP in the frontline of a developing hospital issue - Karen Lumley, the Conservative MP for Redditch. The closure of the accident and emergency unit at the town's Alexandra Hospital is among the options being considered to achieve savings across Worcestershire's hospitals totalling Â£50m. Almost 6,000 people signed a petition last weekend alone as the campaign gathers pace to save Redditch's A&E. Karen Lumley tells us: ""The danger is our people will have nowhere to go in an emergency. Birmingham's QE is 12 miles away. We need to retain emergency services in Redditch."" So how can this be happening when NHS budgets are supposed to be protected? Local health managers say even within ring-fenced budgets, the measures are necessary to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and with what they call the legacy of debts caused (and I'm sure you are ahead of me here) by private finance initiatives. I will be talking live to Karen Lumley on this weekend's Sunday Politics. We will also be joined by Labour's deputy leader in the Lords, and former health minister and, before that, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. And I hope you will join me too, at our usual time of 1200 BST on BBC One on Sunday, 1 July 2012.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scotland's economy grows by 0.1%,"The GDP (gross domestic product) figures for the second quarter were down from the 0.6% growth at the start of 2017. Scotland's first quarter figures were above the equivalent rate for the UK as a whole (0.2%). However, the second quarter was below the UK rate, which was 0.3%. Changes in GDP are the main indicator of economic growth in Scotland. 'Fragile' growth The latest figures showed the service sector, the largest part of Scotland's economy, grew by 0.7%. However, output in the production sector fell by 0.7%, and the construction sector dropped by 3.5%. Year-on-year growth for Scotland's economy was 0.5%, behind the equivalent UK growth of 1.5%. The figures also showed that GDP per person, which shows economic growth after taking population changes into account, grew by 0.1% in the second quarter, in line with the UK as a whole. Prof Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said the figures continued to show how ""fragile"" growth was in the Scottish economy. 'More modest' He said economic growth had been 0.1% or lower in five of the past six quarters. The Scottish government's Economy Secretary Keith Brown said continued growth was ""good news"". Mr Brown said the growth was ""more modest"" than he would like but he was pleased to see the figures for industries linked to the oil and gas supply chain and the service sector. The SNP MSP said the single biggest threat to Scotland's economy remained the lack of clarity from the UK government over Brexit. The UK government's Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the Scottish economy was growing at a ""far slower rate"" than he would like and it still ""lags behind that of the rest of the UK"". 'Erratic economy' The Tory MP said: ""The Scottish government needs to use the considerable levers they have to increase Scotland's prosperity."" Scottish Labour's economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the GDP figures were ""anything but good news"". She accused the Scottish government of ""complacency"" as the Scottish economy remained ""on the cliff edge of recession"".

Michael Gove 'shuddered' at UKIP migrants poster,"The justice secretary joined a number of politicians attacking the poster, featuring a photo taken in Slovenia, with George Osborne saying it had ""echoes"" of 1930s' literature. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage defended it, saying it was ""the truth"". He said it was ""about us being part of a European Union that isn't working"". Critics say the migrants shown in the poster were not coming to the UK and have accused UKIP of trying to scare voters ahead of Thursday's EU referendum. Mr Gove said: ""When I saw that poster, I shuddered. I thought it was the wrong thing to do."" 'Positive message' But Mr Farage, who is not part of the official Leave campaign, defended it in a series of interviews on Sunday morning, saying the scene depicted was ""a direct result"" of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open her country's doors to Syrian refugees, which he described as ""one of the biggest political failures of modern times"". ""The point of that poster was to say that Europe isn't working,"" he told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live, adding: ""Something that's true can't be a scare."" Mr Farage said anyone who ""dares challenge"" the ""narrow Westminster consensus"" on free movement attracts abuse, and said his party was trying to put across a ""positive message"". He told Murnaghan on Sky News: ""It was a one-day poster. I have got six posters and you will see the next one tomorrow morning in the national press and online. UKIP's next posters would be ""all about this country not the wider point it was making there about the European Union failing us all,"" he added. Asked whether he was stoking up hatred, he told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""I think I have been a politician who has been a victim of it, to be honest with you. ""When you challenge the establishment in this country, they come after you, they call you all sorts of things."" Mr Farage said his side of the EU debate had the ""momentum"" until the death of Labour MP Jo Cox, which prompted both campaigns to be suspended. ""It has had an impact on the whole campaign for everybody,"" Mr Farage said. 'Desperate people' His party's poster has been attacked by politicians on both sides of the EU debate. Pro-Leave Commons Leader Chris Grayling said: ""It's the wrong poster, it was the wrong approach, it's the wrong view."" While on the Remain side, Mr Osborne described it as ""disgusting and vile"" with ""echoes of literature used in the 1930s"", while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for it to be withdrawn. ""My argument is let's deal with the impact, let's invest in housing and public services rather than blame immigrants or take a view that we should somehow close our borders,"" she said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was an ""appalling"" poster showing ""a lot of desperate people fleeing from war"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India PM Narendra Modi warning about religious attacks,"By Sanjoy MajumderBBC News In one instance, a Catholic church was burned down in a suburb of the capital. The violence has upset India's Christian community, which is a small but visible and influential minority. Church leaders have alleged that right-wing Hindu groups are behind the attacks and have expressed fears that they have been emboldened after the election victory last year of the Hindu nationalist BJP, led by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The Hindu groups, who have close ties to the BJP, have also carried out a number of mass religious conversions across the country in recent weeks, allegedly forcing or inducing Muslims and Christians to convert to Hinduism. Image affected Mr Modi has been strongly criticised for not speaking out against the Delhi attacks or the conversions. But earlier this week, he spoke out for the first time saying that his government will protect all faiths and not allow any group to incite religious hatred. His comments came at a function organised by church leaders but also followed a humiliating defeat for the BJP in local elections in Delhi this month. Religious strife 2 Dec 2014: Hundreds of Christians protest in Delhi after St Sebastian's Church is badly damaged in a fire 4 Dec: Minister Niranjan Jyoti uses an abusive term to refer to non-Hindus at a rally in Delhi 8 Dec: More than 50 Muslim families reportedly converted to Hinduism against their will in the town of Agra 7 Jan 2015: BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj sparks outrage by urging Hindu women to have at least four children ""in order to protect the Hindu religion"". 14 Jan: Church vandalised in West Delhi's Vikaspuri area 2 Feb: Church vandalised five days before Delhi assembly elections in Vasant Kunj area Many in the BJP and the government believe the prime minister's image has been affected by these attacks and his apparent reluctance to rein in Hindu extremists. They are also conscious of how the violence is hurting India's reputation internationally. In January President Obama spoke out against religious intolerance in India during a visit to the country, saying India's future success would depend on it not splintering along religious lines. Obama's comments were widely reported and picked up by opposition parties to attack the government and its perceived lack of action. So last week, Mr Modi summoned the Delhi police chief, asking him to investigate the attacks urgently. All of this has been welcomed by the Christian community although many of them say the prime minister should have spoken out earlier. Church leaders now say they want steps taken to prevent violence against Christians in other parts of India. But so far there are little signs of Mr Modi making similar overtures to India's large Muslim minority, which has also suffered violence at the hands of Hindu extremists.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Views sought on art at Taunton's Musgrove Park Hospital,"Art for Life is an organisation which displays paintings and sculptures in the buildings and grounds of Musgrove Park Hospital, Taunton. An open day will be held on 3 May so the organisers can receive feedback and ideas from patients and the public. Art for Life was one of the first projects in the country to use art to help reduce stress among patients. Arts co-ordinator Bronwyn Gwillim said: ""A lot of research has been done to show visual arts can reduce anxiety rates and depression among patients. ""We will be giving people the chance to find out more about our work and tell us what they think and where we can make improvements. ""We believe that taking part in art activities makes people feel better and so we want the day to provide lots of opportunities for people to have a go themselves."" The hospital is now home to more than 350 works of art which are chosen and commissioned through the scheme, which is celebrating its 18th anniversary next month. Poetry and music ""Each area will have its own particular needs and patients in that area will be very specific depending on what their conditions are,"" Mrs Gwillim said. ""We will work closely with the staff to develop a brief so that we can be sure that artists are being sensitive to the environment and adding to and enhancing the patients' experience."" Apart from hanging paintings on the walls, the scheme also offers writing, poetry, crafts and music sessions. In 1993 the hospital was one of the first in the country to use art to help patients. ""It came about because of the Duchess Building, which was a new building with two central courtyards which were built to let light into the centre of the building, but had nothing in them,"" said Mrs Gwillim. ""So the idea of putting sculpture and gardens into them came about and Art for Life was commissioned to do that."" No money from the hospital's patient care budget is used for the project.

Pakistan is hit by dengue fever epidemic,"By M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad They have warned that it threatens to affect other parts of the country. More than 4,000 cases of dengue fever have been reported in the past two months, officials say, and at least eight people have died. While the disease is not new in Pakistan, experts say it has spread fast and may reach crisis proportions. They say that the illness is thriving because of poor hygiene, an absence of control measures and the fact that recent heavy monsoon rainfall has lowered temperatures and provided lots of water - ideal conditions for dengue-carrying mosquitoes. Dengue fever is a tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water. 'Choked' sewage system According to the World Health Organisation, the incidence of death among infected patients is 4%. The first case of dengue fever in Pakistan was reported in the southern port city of Karachi in 1994. The province of Punjab - particularly its capital, Lahore - have seen a growing number of cases since 2007. Punjab Health Secretary Jehanzeb Khan said that this year more than 4,000 cases of dengue fever had been reported, a significant increase over previous years. The eight people who have died so far include Ataullah Siddiqui, head of the provincial department for minerals and natural resources. Mr Khan said more than 3,500 infected people live in Lahore city. The head of the city's Jinnah Hospital, Dr Javed Akram, told the BBC that there are several reasons why the virus is concentrated in Lahore. ""It's a large city with poor public hygiene,"" he said. ""We have also had heavy rain for the second year running. In many areas the sewerage system was choked, creating water ponds. ""The city also has vast open spaces and public parks where water has accumulated. In addition, the rains have brought down temperatures by several degrees, creating ideal conditions for the dengue mosquitoes to breed."" Dr Akram says the spread of the disease to other parts of Punjab province has been caused by the government's failure to announce and enforce travel restrictions and its failure to quarantine affected people. ""In the absence of these measures, we expect a greater epidemic next year,"" he said. Officials say the provincial government has set up a telephone helpline and issued pamphlets to create awareness about the fever. The government has also banned morning assemblies in schools for two months to prevent children's exposure to mosquito bites. It is now considering a 10-day closure of schools. Meanwhile, a team of doctors from Sri Lanka is expected to arrive in Lahore today to help combat the epidemic.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Condor Ferries bought by investment fund,"Condor currently operates between Portsmouth, Poole, Guernsey, Jersey and St Malo, and carries about a million passengers every year. The company was put up for sale in 2018 by its Australian owner the Macquarie Group, which bought it in 2008. The deal still has to be approved by regulators. The Columbia Threadneedle European Sustainable Infrastructure Fund said it was ""looking forward to working with management, employees and the Channel Islands"". Brittany Ferries, which operates between the UK, France, Spain and Ireland, said it has bought a ""minority stake"" in the company. For the Channel Islands, Condor is a lifeline service, providing the only ferry routes to the UK and France. Jersey's government welcomed the sale, describing the combination of Brittany Ferries and the investment fund as ""grounds for optimism in the future development of our ferry services"". Charles Parkinson, president of Guernsey's economic development committee, called the deal ""extremely positive news"". ""Having had the opportunity to meet with the new investors I am also confident in their commitment to help Condor deliver ongoing improvements to the resilience, reliability and affordability of our passenger and freight services,"" he added. Condor Ferries Founded in 1964 by Channel Island businessmen Peter Dorey and Jack Norman, Condor operates passenger services between the Channel Islands and France. The ferry network was expanded in 1987 when the company launched the first route connecting the Channel Islands with the UK. Condor currently operates with four ships, including the high-speed vessels Rapide and Liberation, all-weather Commodore Clipper and a freight service Commodore Goodwill. The operator carries more than one million passengers, 200,000 passenger vehicles and 100,000 freight vehicles to the islands each year. The Condor brand is expected to remain intact, with Heiko Schupp from Columbia Threadneedle describing the ferry operator as an ""attractive first investment"" due to its market fundamentals, stable financial position and management team. Travel journalist Simon Calder said the deal means Brittany Ferries would be able to run a more logistically-sensible operation, combining the two companies. ""It also means, frankly, a bit of competition is taken out of the market - it's all about scale in travel, and this will help Condor be part of a bigger enterprise,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump campaign website hacked in 'cryptocurrency scam',"His re-election campaign team is investigating the security breach. ""The world has had enough of the fake news spreaded [sic] daily"" by the US president, a message on www.donaldjtrump.com briefly displayed. The campaign team said there was ""no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site"". The website has now been restored. Screenshots circulating online show the website briefly displayed a fake message, accompanied by the FBI and the US Department of Justice badges. ""It is time to allow the world to know the truth,"" the text on the website read. ""Multiple devices were compromised that gave full access to Trump and relatives."" The hackers also claimed to have proof that the US administration ""is involved in the origin of the coronavirus"" and interfering in the presidential election, which takes place on 3 November. The message then asked for cryptocurrency donations in exchange for access to this information. There is no evidence to back these statements, and the Trump campaign denies any sensitive data was collected. ""The Trump campaign website was defaced and we are working with law enforcement authorities to investigate the source of the attack. There was no exposure to sensitive data because none of it is actually stored on the site,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement to CNN. Website defacements are a low level form of cyber-vandalism akin to someone trespassing on private land and writing a nasty message on a wall in spray paint. The attack only lasted 30 minutes before the hackers were kicked out, so it's unlikely they would have gained much other than a target on their backs if they were silly enough to leave a trail. What's more serious is the potential cyber-security failing on the part of the Trump campaign. This embarrassing incident comes just a week after a Dutch ethical hacker claimed to have logged into the US president's Twitter account by guessing his password. This has yet to be verified. There is no such thing as 100% secure when it comes to cyber-security, but in both these incidents it seems like basic steps might not have been taken. Mr Trump has also been very critical of other people for failing cyber-security measures in the past. During the 2016 election campaign, he criticised opponent Hillary Clinton when her emails were exposed in a hack. Earlier this month, he ruffled feathers when he told supporters: ""Nobody gets hacked. To get hacked you need somebody with 197 IQ and he needs about 15% of your password.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ant and Dec 'wanted to quit' Britain's Got Talent,"The presenting duo felt they were being ""sidelined"", as segments they filmed for the audition shows kept ""ending up on the cutting room floor"". ""It felt like it may as well have been anyone hosting the show,"" wrote Dec in the pair's upcoming autobiography. The situation was only resolved after a tense meeting with Simon Cowell. ""We let him have it with both barrels,"" said Ant in the book, titled Once Upon A Tyne, which has been previewed in The Sun. ""We told him everything - that we weren't being used, that we could be doing other stuff, that maybe someone else should take over."" The duo also told Cowell they had grown frustrated with his timekeeping, adding that his habit of turning up late to auditions ""drives us nuts"". ""To be fair to Simon, he sat there, took it all and listened intently for four, maybe five cigarettes,"" Ant recalled. Dec added: ""He made a promise to us: That things would change and that we'd never feel like that again. ""He desperately wanted us to stay and we told him we'd do the next series and see how it went - and, to be fair to him, he was as good as his word, things did change."" Cowell, who also contributed to the book, admitted that his time-keeping had become ""a real issue"" for the duo. ""We had to come up with some kind of compromise,"" he wrote, ""which now means we work earlier."" Ant and Dec have hosted Britain's Got Talent ever since the showdown, and the TV talent show is now in its 14th series. It is due to return to ITV on 5 September, after this year's live finals were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The broadcaster had initially hoped to film the finals in front of a full audience, but social distancing requirements mean that will no longer be possible, even with the delay. ""Obviously you prefer a big audience but it's a very familiar show and there are ways of making it feel like there is an audience without cranking up the applause track,"" said ITV boss Kevin Lygo at the virtual Edinburgh TV festival on Thursday. ""It puts more pressure on the judges to make sure it's obvious we are all having fun.""

Mexico police detain US 'sect leader' after triple murder,"Police raided three houses and two ranches belonging to Orson William Black Jr, 56, who is wanted on charges of child abuse in the US. Prosecutors say he is also a suspect in the killing of three US citizens in the area in September. Twenty-six other people living on the properties were also detained. The arrests come less than two months after 23-year-old Jesse Barlow and brothers Robert and Michael Black, aged 19 and 15 respectively, were shot dead at Rancho El Negro. It is not clear if they were relatives or followers of Mr Black, or if they had been taken to the property against their will. Self-declared prophet The ranches are located in a colony set up by a Mennonite Christian group in 1922. Watch: A portrait of Mexico's Mennonite community After fleeing the United States in 2003, Orson William Black Jr settled in the colony, where he is believed to have set up his own polygamous sect, set apart from the Mennonite group living there. Mr Black had previously been a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), whose former leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving life in prison for sexually assaulting two underage followers he took as brides. The child abuse charges against Mr Black were brought in the state of Arizona in 2003 after two teenage girls he took as his ""brides"" became pregnant. Shortly after the charges were brought, a US reporter traced Mr Black to the Mennonite colony in Chihuahua. He is believed to have been living there ever since with his four ""wives"", his children and a number of fellow US citizens. Dead lion The raid on his properties was carried out by Mexican security forces with the help of the FBI. Mexico's prosecutors' office said that so far, Mr Black had been charged with entering Mexico illegally and with animal cruelty after dozens of butchered animals, including a lion and zebras, were found on his ranches. It is not clear where the animals came from or what their intended use was. The prosecutor's office said the 26 people detained on Mr Black's properties would be extradited to the US as they had entered the country illegally.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Over to you, chancellor","Simon JackBusiness editor Although a cut of quarter of a percent was not a surprise, a specific message that it could fall further towards zero by year end was unexpected. Add to that an additional Â£70bn pumped into the system through buying bonds with newly created money plus another Â£100bn of cheap money made available to banks for lending and it is clear the Bank of England has real concerns about the economy. It has slashed its growth forecast for the UK economy next year from 2.3% to just 0.8% - and that's including the impact of today's measures. While describing this package as comprehensive and co-ordinated, the Bank was very clear about what it could NOT do. While it can increase the SUPPLY of credit while protecting the profit margins of the the banks who offer it, it can't increase the DEMAND for it. Future Businesses may be more concerned with things that only the government can address. In a time of post-Brexit uncertainty, businesses will be understandably reluctant to invest until they get a better idea, for example, of the government's plans for tax and spending, as well as our future relationship with the UK's biggest trading partner. In the last few hours, the former chancellor, George Osborne, has taken to social media to call for lower business taxes and increased infrastructure spending. The British Chambers of Commerce have echoed that, calling for the government to ""offer incentives for business investment and address some of the long-term, structural issues facing the UK economy, such as our chronic underinvestment in infrastructure"". The CBI joined in saying the government needed to take ""swift, decisive action to unlock key infrastructure investment and show that the UK is open for business"". Tools The governor said all of today's measures could, and in the case of lower rates very likely would, be taken further but was also clear that he is looking for the government to do its part to shore up the UK economy. In a statement this afternoon, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said he was confident that both he and the governor ""had the tools available to support the economy"".

Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions,"By Patrick Cowling & Sadaf MarufBBC News Home Office figures obtained by the BBC show delays have almost tripled since January 2014, when 484 children had been waiting for more than five years. In May the government said it was abandoning a six-month wait target for most asylum applications. The Home Office said cases involving children ""can take longer to resolve"". In 2014, the Home Office introduced a target to process 98% of straightforward asylum claims within six months. In a freedom of information request the BBC asked for the number of children under the age of 18 at the time of their asylum application who had been waiting for an initial decision on their asylum claim for more than six months, more than 12 months, and for more than five years in both 2014 and 2018. In September 2018, there were 6,214 dependant children who had been waiting more than six months for an initial decision - almost a 47% rise in four years compared with January 2014. The number of children waiting more than five years increased at an even steeper rate - rising from 484 in 2014 to 1,396 in September 2018. Last year, there were 29,380 new asylum claims - from people of all ages. In the same year 21,119 decisions were made on existing claims. Rupinder Parhar, policy officer at The Children's Society, said the lives of ""vulnerable young people are being unfairly put on hold"" by the delays. ""This uncertainty can have a devastating impact upon their mental health, particularly if they are unaccompanied in the UK, and are already struggling with the trauma of unimaginable horrors including war, persecution, torture and abuse."" Long delays have meant some asylum seekers have turned 18 while waiting for a decision on their applications. Applicants are not allowed to work while their application is considered, often leaving them dependent on limited UK government asylum support benefits. 'Devastating impact' The government allows Â£37.75 per week in asylum support for each person in a household. Being a pregnant mother or having a child between the ages of one and three allows an additional Â£3, while a household with a baby under one is allowed an extra Â£5 per week. The rules do allow individuals who have waited longer than 12 months for an initial decision on their claim to request permission to work. They will only be allowed to take up a job which is included on the list of shortage occupations. These occupations include engineering jobs, medical roles, and IT specialists. Those lacking the relevant qualifications and experience for these specific jobs will be denied permission to work. A Home Office spokesman said asylum cases involving children are often ""highly complex, with stringent safeguards regarding child welfare, and can take longer to resolve. ""We are currently working closely with other agencies on a new service standard for decision-making in these cases."" Additional research by Ben Butcher",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hong Kong: What is China's 'patriot' plan for electoral reform?,"Beijing says the goal is to keep ""unpatriotic"" figures from positions of political power in Hong Kong. But critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, eradicating whatever opposition there is left. What's the background? Hong Kong used to be under British control, but was handed back to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle. This was meant to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong, which no other part of mainland China has: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary, and some democratic rights. These freedoms are enshrined in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was meant to last until 2047. On 11 March, the ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" resolution was passed at the National People's Congress (NPC), paving the way for Beijing to amend annexes of the Basic Law. On 30 March, the resolution passed the NPC's Standing Committee and could be enacted in Hong Kong within weeks. How will it work? Candidates for Hong Kong's parliament, the Legislative Council (LegCo) are to be nominated by the Election Committee, a powerful body which until now only elected the city's most senior official, the Chief Executive. This Election Committee, which is heavily pro-Beijing, will be expanded by 300 members from 1,200 to 1,500. Any prospective MP, member of the Election Committee or candidate for Chief Executive will be vetted by a separate screening committee, making it easy to bar anyone deemed as being critical of Beijing. There will also be changes to LegCo itself, diluting the influence of directly elected MPs. While overall seats will increase from 70 to 90, the number of directly elected representatives will fall from 35 to 20. Forty seats will go to MPs chosen by the Election Committee while 30 will be given to MPs elected by special interests such as business, banking and trade, which historically are also pro-Beijing. Why is it being enacted? The move appears to be a continuation of China's plan to tighten control over Hong Kong, following recent developments. Huge pro-democracy protests took place in 2019, some of which turned violent. Later that year, pro-democracy groups made huge gains in local district council elections. Since then, Beijing has passed a controversial national security law, which effectively reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. Dozens of people have since been arrested under this law. In November 2020, several lawmakers were deemed threats to national security and dismissed - this led to the resignation of nearly all the city's pro-democracy lawmakers. The developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power. Critics, including the UK government, allege that China is now effectively undermining the ""one country, two systems"" principle with all these changes. But Beijing says it is safeguarding its sovereignty, and rejects what it calls ""foreign interference"" in domestic affairs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Iran scientist Shahram Amiri free to leave, US insists","The state department rejected claims by Tehran that Shahram Amiri, who surfaced at a Pakistani embassy building, had been abducted by US agents. Mr Amiri vanished more than a year ago. In June, three videos apparently showing him - and containing contradictory information on his whereabouts - emerged. He said in the first that he had been kidnapped by US and Saudi agents, in the second that he was living freely in Arizona, and in the third that he had escaped from his captors. On Monday evening, he arrived at the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani embassy in Washington, which handles Iranian affairs in the US capital. Iranian media say Mr Amiri had worked as a researcher at a university in Tehran, but some reports say he worked for the country's atomic energy organisation and had in-depth knowledge of its controversial nuclear programme. At the time of his disappearance, he was thought to be on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. US TV network ABC reported in March that he had defected and was helping the CIA by revealing valuable information about the Iranian nuclear programme. But earlier this month, Tehran said it had proof that Mr Amiri was being held in the US. 'His alone' State department spokesman PJ Crowley said: ""He has been in the United States of his own free will and obviously he is free to go. ""In fact, he was scheduled to travel to Iran yesterday, but was unable to make all of the necessary arrangements to reach Iran through transit countries."" There are no direct flights from the US to Iran and the two countries have no diplomatic ties. Mr Crowley added that Mr Amiri had informed American authorities that he wished to leave the US - which seems to confirm that American officials have been in touch with him. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters at a news conference that Mr Amiri had been kidnapped during the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and taken to the US against his will. He said Mr Amiri should be allowed to return home ""without any obstacle"". US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Mr Amiri was free to go, and highlighted the case of three young Americans held by Iran since July 2009 and accused of illegally entering the country. ""These are decisions that are his alone to make,"" she said. ""In contrast, Iran continues to hold three young Americans against their will, and we reiterate our request that they be released and allowed to return to their families on a humanitarian basis."" Mrs Clinton also mentioned the case of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Scientists found fossilised butterfly scales the size of a speck of dust inside ancient rock from Germany. The find pushes back the date for the origins of the Lepidoptera, one of the most prized and studied insect groups. Researchers say they can learn more about the conservation of butterflies and moths by studying their early evolution. They used acid to dissolve ancient rocks, leaving behind small fragments, including ""perfectly preserved"" scales that covered the wings of early moths and butterflies. ""We found the microscopic remains of these organisms in the form of these scales,"" said Dr Bas van de Schootbrugge from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Intriguingly, they show that some of the moths and butterflies belonged to a group still alive today that have long straw-like tongues for sucking up nectar. ""These finds push back the evolution of this group with proboscises - with a tongue - by about 70 million years,"" said Dr van de Schootbrugge. ""Our finds show that the group that was supposed to co-evolve with flowers is actually much older."" The Jurassic was a world dominated by gymnosperm plants, such as conifers, which produced sugary nectar to capture pollen from the air. The primitive insects may have fed on this nectar, before flowering plants came along around 130 million years ago. Dr Russell Garwood of the University of Manchester, who is not connected with the study, said it had always been assumed that coiled mouthparts had evolved alongside the flowers that these animals pollinate. ""This new evidence suggests that perhaps the coiled mouthparts had another role, before flowering plants evolved,"" he said. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, gives clues to how butterflies and moths became so widespread, thriving on every continent except Antarctica. The early Lepidopterans survived the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic, which wiped out many other living things. This knowledge will help inform modern conservation efforts, said Dr Timo van Eldijk, also of Utrecht University, the lead researcher on the study. The information is ""paramount to help us piece together how current manmade climate change might affect insects and their evolution in the future"", he said. Butterflies and moths are fragile creatures, meaning fossil evidence is rare. Scientists have relied largely on DNA evidence from modern butterflies and moths, which can be used to make an evolutionary tree of life. Follow Helen on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cambridge anorexic woman who died 'wanted to be assessed',"Amanda Bowles, 45, was found at her Cambridge home in September 2017. The inquest heard Ms Bowles was not monitored for about four months after she was discharged from the eating disorder service. The inquest is the latest to be heard of a cluster of five deaths of people with anorexia between 2012 and 2018. Sean Horstead, assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire, is overseeing the investigations into the deaths of patients who were being treated by local NHS mental health teams. The hearing was told that Ms Bowles telephoned her GP surgery on 13 April 2017 and told them she had not been monitored since her discharge from the service in December 2016. On 25 May Dr Mark Dourish visited Ms Bowles at her home to carry out an assessment before regular monitoring by district nurses could take place. He said he took her temperature and blood pressure - both of which produced readings normal for the patient. Ms Bowles was also ""able to perform the squat test without difficulty"", he said. 'No scales' The inquest heard Ms Bowles should have also been weighed during the home visit, but she had told Dr Dourish she had no scales. A representative for Ms Bowles family said she had two sets of scales at home. ""I took her at her word,"" Dr Dourish said. Dr Dourish said he did not think Ms Bowles was trying to hide her weight since she had asked for monitoring to take place. The inquest had heard Ms Bowles had said she would be ""happier"" if monitoring took place. Dr Dourish said: ""I took it as a positive and reassuring sign that she was trying to get us back involved again."" The inquest heard Ms Bowles was registered for ""assisted technology"" which meant she was responsible for measuring her own weight and reporting this to the GP surgery. Dr Dourish said it would not have been a system he would have recommended for Ms Bowles. The recorded cause of Ms Bowles' death was pneumonia. A pathology report said her eating disorder was likely to have contributed. The inquest continues.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Guildford Four's Gerry Conlon: Funeral takes place in Belfast,"His coffin was carried into St Peter's Cathedral in west Belfast by four members of the Birmingham Six. Mr Conlon died at home in west Belfast on 21 June, after an illness. He was 60-years-old. He was one of the Guildford Four, who spent 15 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1989. His memoirs, Proved Innocent, were used as a basis for the Hollywood film In the Name of the Father, in which his part was played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Irish deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore was among a number of politicians who attended the funeral, as did the high-profile lawyer Gareth Peirce, who represented both the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six. In a statement issued through Ms Peirce, Mr Conlon's family said: ""He brought life, love, intelligence, wit and strength to our family through its darkest hours. ""We thank him for his life and we thank all his many friends for their love."" Ms Pierce, who became a close friend of Mr Conlon after his release, paid a personal tribute to him at the ceremony. She told mourners: ""When he shouted out 'I'm an innocent man, my father was innocent, the Maguires are innocent and the Birmingham Six', he set something in motion that forced the rest of us, the rest of the world, Britain, to hold a mirror up to ourselves and see precisely who we were and what we had done."" The Guildford Four were convicted amid the backdrop of an IRA bombing campaign targeting pubs in England. Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson were jailed for life in 1975 for an attack on the Horse and Groom pub in Guildford which killed four soldiers and a civilian, as well as injuring scores more. All those involved vigorously protested their innocence. The Court of Appeal quashed their sentences in October 1989, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, who was also jailed as part of a discredited investigation into a supposed bomb making family - the Maguire Seven - died in prison. In his homily at Gerry Conlon's funeral, Father Ciaran Dallat said he always carried a burden of guilt, feeling he was responsible for the death of his father. ""In the master's house, the place that Jesus has prepared in heaven, we trust that Giuseppe and Sarah are there and he will truly be at peace at last because Giuseppe will reassure him, as his mother tried so often, that it wasn't his fault - it wasn't his fault, other people got it wrong."" An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the investigation. It is considered to be one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in Britain. The perpetrators of the Guildford bomb attack have never been brought to justice. Gerry Conlon was buried at Milltown cemetery.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Staffordshire reveals cost of policing mental illness,"Patrick BurnsPolitical editor, Midlands One of the first things to strike Staffordshire's incoming PCC, Matthew Ellis, was the escalating cost to his force of dealing with people with mental illnesses. He tells us: ""When you get a couple of police officers taken off an entire shift simply to look after an individual who hasn't committed a crime and is simply ill, but still sees the inside of a police cell with two police officers checking them to make sure they're ok, it's not the right use of resources and it's certainly not something police officers are qualified to do."" What he is not saying is that it is never the job of the police to intervene, especially out of hours, when mental health-related incidents require urgent and decisive action. But he is convinced that the police are all too often the agency of last resort when ideally other caring services might have prevented problems escalating to crisis-levels requiring the services of the police. Single pot of money And inevitably at a time when the police are having to make ever more stringent savings, there is mounting concern about the cost of dealing with people who are mentally ill, estimated at nearly Â£1m in Staffordshire alone last year. In 2012, the force attended 15,000 incidents and arrested 169 people solely for the purpose of mental health assessments. But the cost argument works both ways. If Mr Ellis wants NHS teams to take more active roles upfront, they too would need to be funded to do so. Would he and his fellow PCCs be prepared to contribute to a single pot of money to make this happen? The North Staffordshire Combined NHS Trust tell us they work closely with the police in custody facilities to help officers deal with mentally ill detainees. But inevitably, they have strict budget limits of their own. Therapeutic response But it's not just the cost or the resources that worry Matthew Ellis. His other big concern is that when mentally ill people fall through the gaps in the system and into the hands of the police, their paraphernalia of handcuffs and custody cells is not exactly the kind of therapeutic response these unfortunate people really need. Staffordshire's Mental Health Review, commissioned by Mr Ellis, makes 12 main recommendations. Among them: Mr Ellis will be with me in the studio for this week's Sunday Politics from 11:00 BST on BBC One. This is by way of a co-production with our colleagues on Inside Out Midlands who have been out on patrol with Staffordshire Police to experience some of the challenging realities confronting them out on the ground.

Boris Johnson seeks spokesperson to front White House-style briefings,"The job, advertised on the Conservative LinkedIn page, is described as a chance to ""communicate with the nation on behalf of the prime minister"". ""Essential skills"" include ""excellent risk management and crisis communication skills"". The salary is ""based on experience"", but the Daily Telegraph suggests it is likely to be more than Â£100,000-a-year. The successful applicant is likely to be an experienced broadcaster - and the subject of intense media scrutiny. In the US, presidential spokesman such as Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci became household names and sometimes found themselves at the centre of controversy. Traditionally, the UK government's twice daily media briefings have been held behind closed doors, with a civil servant taking questions from a group of accredited journalists, known as the lobby. Quotes are attributed to the ""prime minister's official spokesman"". From September, the afternoon lobby briefing will be filmed at 9 Downing Street, while the morning session will continue to be off-camera. 'Political move' The new spokesperson will be employed as a special adviser, a temporary class of civil servant allowed to give political advice to ministers, meaning they will be free to attack the opposition parties, as well as setting out the government's position. Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned that the plan could risk ""unbalancing the political discourse"" and is ""obviously a political move"". He said Labour was considering ways to get a right of reply to the briefings. The prime minister has defended the plan, saying it will build on the experience of the daily coronavirus press conference which gave people ""more direct, detailed information from the government"". The job description tells potential applicants: ""You will represent the government and the prime minister to an audience of millions on a daily basis, across the main broadcast channels and social media, and have the chance to influence and shape public opinion.

EU-student funding guarantee extended,"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter And these students' loans and grants will be available for the duration of their degree course. The arrangement will be honoured even if the UK exits the EU in that period. Universities said the announcement gave the higher education sector much-needed clarity on the matter and must be communicated to European students. The government's guarantee means EU students applying to study from 2017-18 will be able to access the same funding and support they are now. Ministers say the move will help give universities and colleges certainty over future funding. 'Stability' Shortly after the EU referendum result in June, the government gave a guarantee that students currently in higher or further education - and those applying for a place this academic year (2016-17) - would continue to be able to access student funding support. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said: ""We know that the result of the referendum brought with it some uncertainties for our higher education sector. ""International students make an important contribution to our world class universities, and we want that to continue. ""This latest assurance that students applying to study next year will not only be eligible to apply for student funding under current terms, but will have their eligibility maintained throughout the duration of their course, will provide important stability for both universities and students."" Universities UK president Dame Julia Goodfellow said the news provided much-needed clarity. ""Every effort must now be made to ensure that this announcement is communicated effectively to prospective students across Europe,"" she said. ""European and international students are a valuable part of cultural and academic life on British university campuses and play an important role in UK towns and cities, creating jobs and supporting local businesses. ""Looking ahead, as the government develops plans [for] post-Brexit Britain, a commitment is needed to ensure that students, from Europe and beyond, are able to continue to come to the UK to study without unnecessary bureaucratic burdens."" Dame Julia said she hoped the announcement would be followed shortly by similar reassurances from governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The University and College Union said it was pleased the government had clarified the situation for EU students and and hoped the devolved nations would soon follow suit.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
General Election: Loyalists warn unionists not to vote Alliance,"By Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) was launched in 2015. In a statement, it said that ""any unionist who votes for the Alliance Party is driving a nail into the coffin of the union"". The Alliance Party has strongly rebuked the LCC position, calling the statement ""absurd"". The loyalist community council has the backing of the Ulster Defence Association, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. The LCC also said no party has done ""more to undermine the Britishness of Northern Ireland, and foment community mistrust and division than the Alliance Party"". It called for a maximum turnout by unionist voters and endorsed four specific candidates. They are Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the DUP's Nigel Dodds in North Belfast, the DUP's Gavin Robinson in East Belfast and the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly in South Belfast. In the first two constituencies, the candidates mentioned are the only unionists running, but in the other two seats the DUP faces competition from the Ulster Unionists. Alliance 'satisfied' In a statement, the Alliance Party said: ""In sharp contrast to the DUP, who appear content to accept the endorsement of paramilitaries, Alliance is satisfied to accept their rejection of our principled and consistent stand for the rule of law and against all terrorism. ""This absurd statement shows not only the dearth of political analysis within loyalist paramilitaries at this time, but highlights clearly which parties are really willing to take on and challenge paramilitaries, and which are happier to chase and foster their support."" In Monday night's UTV election debate, both Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill and Alliance's Naomi Long challenged the DUP's Nigel Dodds to reject the endorsement of a group linked to loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Dodds replied that his party had always opposed paramilitarism. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Tuesday, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""I do not seek, nor does the DUP seek the support or endorsement of any paramilitary organisation, and we reject any such endorsement."" The Ulster Unionist Party leader, Robin Swann, said: ""The Ulster Unionist Party is a party of law and order. ""We have not asked for the support of paramilitary organisations nor do we want the backing of organisations still engaged in paramilitary or criminal activity."" On social media, former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has clarified that he has not asked for and does not accept the LCC's statement of support. Mr Nesbitt was not one of the candidates mentioned in the group's election statement. Tony Blair's former chief of staff Jonathan Powell played a part in setting up the LCC. Mr Powell described the formation of the council as the ""last best chance"" to include loyalists left behind by the peace process.

Manchester Arena Inquiry: 'Stakes too high' to delay 'Martyn's Law',"Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett died in the attack, wants to bring in legislation to step up security in crowded public spaces and venues. The government backed the plans but work has stalled due to Covid-19. Ms Murray told the public inquiry into the bombing that ""the stakes are too high"" for further delay. ""We just cannot wait for Covid-19 to end and then do the consultation because we don't how long Covid-19 is going to be with us,"" she said. Ms Murray said an ""additional worry"" was the uncertainty about how many people will have been radicalised online during lockdown. Mr Hett, 29, was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing in May 2017, which left hundreds more injured. Sir John Saunders, chairman of the inquiry, praised Ms Murray for her efforts, ""We think it is wonderful that you are doing so much to make something constructive come out of this tragedy by campaigning to introduce Martyn's Law to save others from suffering in the way you and other families have,"" he said. ""I know other families are also working to make other positive outcomes for the benefit of others as their response to the tragedy they have suffered."" Ms Murray told the inquiry she was inspired to take action after going to a concert in Manchester in December 2018, where she decided to take her smallest handbag to make the ""bag search easy"". But she said she was shocked to discover she was able to walk straight in without being searched. ""I was foolish; I assumed that since the Arena attack security in public areas is now a common thing and I was shocked that it wasn't,"" she said. Among her plans are the introduction of free counter-terror training for event staff, assessments of locations to see how vulnerable they are, and the need for venues and local authorities to have counter-terror action plans. She said there were more than 650,000 crowded spaces, including street markets, bus stations and churches. The inquiry heard Ms Murray had a 25-minute phone call with Home Secretary Priti Patel, who she said expressed support for Martyn's Law. Ms Murray said: ""When the next attack happens, if the government haven't acted, if something happens and people are killed, the families of those people who died may ask the question - why hasn't something been done if nothing's been carried out?""

Runshaw college: Machete found after gang attack,"The weapon was found by a police dog in a search after the disorder at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire, on Monday. Six people were arrested after police were tipped off that a group was heading to the college ""with weapons"". Footage on social media appears to show students fleeing a confrontation with masked men. The gang of around 12 young men - some brandishing knives wearing balaclavas and face masks - arrived at the college at about 16:00 GMT to confront a rival group. Three men in a parked car were arrested nearby. A fourth person who made off on foot was also arrested. Two more were held on Monday evening, with one picked up in a car on the M55 and one arrested in Preston. A 17-year-old student was ""nicked on the arm"" during an altercation in the college grounds. He was treated in Chorley Hospital but his wound was not serious. The suspects, two men aged 18 and three 17-year-old boys, all from Preston, and a third 18-year-old man from Kirkham, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and later released on bail. At the scene - Mike Stevens, BBC Radio Lancashire Regular patrols are visible in the vicinity of the college this morning, as police work to reassure students. Officers say their focus will now move to the investigation and they will be speaking to the six people in custody over the course of the day. They are also keen to hear from anybody who witnessed what happened or has any mobile footage of the incident. The MP for South Ribble Seema Kennedy has raised the issue with the Home Secretary. A search was carried out after reports of a machete-style knife being used in the attack. Lancashire Police Dog Unit said on Facebook: ""It didn't take the team long to recover the weapon and other pieces of valuable evidence.""

Covid-19: Northamptonshire moves to tier 3,"The county, currently in tier two, will face the higher level of restrictions from 00:01 GMT on 26 December, the government has announced. People in tier three can form bubbles with another household on Christmas Day, but not with anyone in tier four. Director of public health, Lucy Wightman, called the news ""exceptionally difficult"". Northamptonshire was previously described as having been a ""hair's breadth"" away from tier three. The restrictions in tier three also mean bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to close except for takeaways or deliveries. It also means sports fans can no longer attend events in stadiums. Despite the new measures, Public Health Northamptonshire said it was ""proud of the way residents in the county have behaved"". Director of public health, Lucy Wightman, said residents had shown ""remarkable resilience and compliance"". ""I know that this is exceptionally difficult news. I know it will mean festive plans are disrupted and that for businesses affected this will be a very significant blow, especially those in the hospitality sector,"" she said. ""I also know that for many of us this will mean changing our plans once again. ""Residents who have booked to eat out on Boxing Day will now have to celebrate at home. I urge you all to continue to remain calm. ""All shops will remain open so there is no need for stockpiling or panic buying."" She added that due to continued pressure on the NHS the move to tier three ""is absolutely essential"". Northampton's professional football and rugby union clubs have outlined what it means for sports fans. In a statement on its website, Northampton Town FC said games against Gillingham and Sunderland ""have unfortunately reverted back to behind closed doors fixtures"" following the move. The club added that this ""means, regrettably, the club have had to cancel all tickets previously issued and supporters who had tickets for those matches should please not attend"". Northampton Saints' match against Worcester Warriors on 26 December will also now be played behind closed doors, rather than in front of 2,000 supporters as planned.

Gamer Hbomberguy hands funding row charity Donkey Kong boost,"YouTuber Hbomberguy made Â£265,000 by playing Nintendo 64's Donkey Kong live online after a proposed lottery grant for Mermaids was put under review. Father Ted sitcom writer Graham Linehan had called for opposition to the grant on parenting website Mumsnet. The charity said donations would help expand services and support youngsters. Susie Green, the CEO of the Leeds-based charity, said a total of Â£270,000 had been generated. She said Â£5,000 was raised separately as a result of the 58-hour live gaming event, which was streamed online and had attracted high-profiled guest appearances including US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ""We're just stunned. It was completely out of the blue,"" she said. ""It's a massive boost for the kids."" Ms Green said the charity, which supports teenagers and children with gender identity issues, was yet to decide on how the funds would be used. But she suggested some of the money would go towards increasing the number of local support groups it runs across the country and recruiting three additional staff members. ""I don't think we've ever seen this amount of support for us on social media. It was magical,"" she said. ""Seeing cash being donated like this was transformational for us. ""We're still getting our heads round this money."" She said the charity were unaware about the fundraiser until after the marathon gaming event had started on Friday. Hbomberguy, whose real name is Harris Brewis, explained in his video he had never beaten Donkey Kong 64 as a child and pledged to take on the hurdle. In the video, he said he ""chose to support Mermaids"" because people had been ""woefully misinformed"" about ""the media discussion surrounding this issue"". He added: ""I'd like to do my bit to help support the people who do the hard work of contributing to people's thinking on an important issue."" He announced his challenge after Linehan criticised Mermaids and described the charity's expansion plans as ""terrifying"". Ms Green said lottery funding would allow the charity to increase the number of their local support groups from eight to 53. In a statement, Big Lottery said a review was ongoing after it ""received a range of correspondence in relation to a proposed grant to Mermaids, expressing both concern and support regarding this organisation"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Olympic Games Â£500k steam cloud artwork in Wirral delayed,"The Â£500,000 publicly funded spinning column of cloud was set to rise over the Wirral estuary from 31 December as part of the Cultural Olympiad. It has yet to get planning permission as the Civil Aviation Authority wants tests to be carried out on the column. A spokesman for developers said they could not comment on the launch date. The Olympic torch will pass through Merseyside on 1 June. Plans were submitted to Wirral Council in October for the 20 metre (65 ft) wide column, commissioned by the Arts Council, which is one of 12 public art commissions across the UK for the Cultural Olympiad. 'Minded to approve' It is planned to rise 1.2 miles (2 km) into the air above the Wirral waterfront on the Mersey, directly opposite Liverpool's World Heritage Site at the Pier Head. The steam cloud, created by artist Anthony McCall and simply called Column, will be on the flight path to John Lennon Airport and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it required testing to be done on its impact on aviation. The CAA said it was ""working with developers looking to make it happen"". David Ball, head of planning at Wirral Council, said approval could be granted ""within a couple of days"" once the CAA is satisfied, as council officers have delegated powers meaning it does not need to go back to the planning committee. He said: ""Subject to certain information from the Civil Aviation Authority, the council is minded to approve the application."" A spokesman for developers Projected Columns who are producing the column said: ""It is not unusual for artistic projects of this size, scale and ambition take time to develop. ""We are confident that the final stages of planning permission will be complete in the coming weeks and that it will launch as part of the London 2012 Cultural Festival.""

Not guilty plea in landmark Kodi box trial,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Mr Thompson is accused of selling ""fully loaded"" Kodi boxes, modified with software that allowed users to watch pirated content. The case will be closely watched by other traders who sell similar boxes. The trial will begin in May. Mr Thompson denied two charges of selling equipment that facilitated the circumvention of copyright protection measures. The case, heard at Teesside Crown Court, was brought by Middlesbrough Council after Trading Standards officers raided Mr Thompson's shop Cut Price Tomo's TV in Middlesbrough in March. The council bought two of the TV boxes in question from Mr Thompson's shop. After his first court appearance in September, Mr Thompson told the Northern Echo: ""These boxes are available from all over the place, not just me, but it's the downloading of software to watch channels that is apparently causing the problem."" ""If I am found guilty and the court rules that I am breaking the law selling these boxes, I want to know what that means for people buying and selling mobile phones or laptops because the software is available for all of them."" Ernesto van der Sar, editor of piracy news website TorrentFreak told the BBC: ""The case is likely to determine where the boundaries lie when it comes to offering ""fully loaded"" Kodi TV devices in the UK. ""While is doesn't affect users directly, it's expected to have a profound impact on sellers in this rapidly growing business."" He added: ""While Kodi itself is a neutral platform, there are lots of add-ons available for it that make pirated content readily available. Users often add these themselves at home, but the question in this case is whether shopkeepers are permitted to pre-install them."" Fully loaded boxes, that come pre-installed with the add-ons are fairly common in online stores. Users can add the software themselves but may require a degree of technical knowledge, said Mr van der Sar. Kieron Sharp, director general of the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact) said: ""Set-top and IPTV boxes which are 'cracked' or altered with software to allow you access to copyright-infringing apps and add-ons are illegal devices. The sale and distribution of these boxes is a criminal offence and the repercussions could result in years behind bars."" He added that Fact had been working with police forces across the UK to combat individuals selling such devices but did not say whether the organisation planned a similar crackdown on people who installed add-ons at home.

Surrey Police investigation over 'misgendering' tweets,"Caroline Farrow said Surrey Police wants to ""conduct a taped interview under caution"" because of tweets posted in October. They were made after she was on ITV's Good Morning Britain with Susie Green, whose daughter Jackie is transgender. Ms Green said the posts were malicious and it was ""not just the misgendering"" issue. Ms Green, the founder of the transgender rights charity Mermaids, said she had now withdrawn her complaint to the police. But Surrey Police said a withdrawal statement must be made for a complaint to be dropped and that had not yet happened in this case. The force said it had received an allegation on 15 October ""in relation to a number of tweets which were posted in October 2018"". ""A thorough investigation is being carried out to establish whether any criminal offences have taken place,"" it said. ""A 44-year-old woman has been asked to attend a voluntary interview in relation to the allegation as part of our ongoing investigation."" 'So furious' In the ITV interview, the Catholic journalist and commentator had been discussing with Ms Green the Girl Guides letting children who have changed gender join. Ms Farrow tweeted the police's decision to launch an investigation was an ""outrage"", adding: ""I can't sleep I am so furious."" She said: ""I don't even remember said tweets. I probably said 'he' or 'son' or something. ""All I have been told is that following an appearance on Good Morning Britain I made some tweets misgendering Susie Green's child and that I need to attend a taped interview."" She added it was her ""religious belief that a person cannot change sex"" and she would ""happily do jail time"" for her right to express that view. But she added she tried ""really hard not to misgender people"". 'Really damaging' Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Green said: ""Every day my daughter is misgendered online... this was a journalist who had a public platform who used that to send very deliberately malicious nasty messages. ""It's not just the misgendering, it's actually the context that she puts it in to, and that she calls me a child abuser."" She added that complaining to the police was the ""appropriate course of action"" given the ""really damaging things she said about me and my actions"". Ms Green said she had withdrawn her complaint partly because she did not want Ms Farrow to continue to have a platform.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wife of 39 years fails in divorce refusal appeal,"Tini Owens, 66, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling, which said she could not divorce her husband Hugh Owens, 78. But the appeal judges, led by Sir James Munby, upheld the original ruling. However, Sir James did point out that some people would feel unhappiness should be grounds for divorce. The decision means Mrs Owens will have to remain married, although after five years of separation she would be eligible for a divorce even if her husband still objected. The couple married in 1978 and lived in Broadway, Worcestershire. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Owens' case was that the marriage had broken down, although Mr Owens disagreed, saying that the couple still had a ""few years"" to enjoy. Mrs Owens contended that she had been left in a ""wretched predicament"", locked in a ""loveless and desperately unhappy"" marriage. She had made 27 allegations about the way Mr Owens treated her, including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"" and said she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. Opposing a family court ruling made last year by Judge Robin Tolson, who refused to grant a divorce petition on the basis her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"", she took the case to the Court of Appeal. But on Friday, Sir James - the most senior family court judge in England and Wales - said: ""We cannot interfere with Judge Tolson's decision, and refuse the wife the decree of divorce she sought."" He said Judge Tolson had correctly concluded that the marriage had not ""in law"" irretrievably broken down. Grounds for divorce in England and Wales: When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Source: Gov.UK However, Sir James added: ""Parliament has decreed that it is not a ground for divorce that you find yourself in a wretchedly unhappy marriage, though some people may say it should be.""

North Korea: Mike Pompeo rejects 'gangster-like' accusation,"After two days of talks with senior officials, he said efforts to push Pyongyang towards abandoning nuclear weapons had international backing. He stressed that denuclearisation was a condition for lifting sanctions. It was Mr Pompeo's first visit to the North since last month's summit between Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump. The North Korean leader says he is committed to denuclearisation, but how this will be achieved is unclear. How did the North see the latest talks? Mr Pompeo did not meet Mr Kim. Instead, on Friday and Saturday he held talks with Kim Jong-chol, seen as the North Korean leader's right-hand man, on how to proceed with denuclearisation. Afterwards, state media carried a statement saying the US had gone against the spirit of the summit by acting unilaterally to put pressure on the country. ""We had anticipated the US side would come with a constructive idea, thinking we would take something in return,"" the statement said, warning its ""resolve for denuclearisation... may falter"". ""The US is fatally mistaken if it went to the extent of regarding that [North Korea] would be compelled to accept, out of its patience, demands reflecting its gangster-like mindset,"" it added. The statement, by an unnamed foreign ministry official, was in sharp contrast with the account given by Mr Pompeo as he left North Korea for Japan just hours before. He said the talks had ""made progress on almost all of the central issues"". North Korean state media often carries uncompromising language, and some analysts and officials speculated the use of the term may be a negotiating tactic. How has Mr Pompeo responded? After talks with the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea on Sunday, the secretary of state said his efforts to press the North on nuclear weapons were legitimate. ""If those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, because there was a unanimous decision at the UN Security Council about what needs to be achieved,"" he told reporters in Tokyo. He added: ""When we spoke to them about denuclearisation, they did not push back."" He also admitted that the ""road ahead will be difficult and challenging"". After the Singapore summit in June, which also saw the US promise to end military drills with South Korea, Mr Trump claimed that the North no longer posed a nuclear threat. However, the president has since renewed sanctions on North Korea, while US intelligence officials have said there is evidence North Korea continues to upgrade the infrastructure for its nuclear and missile programmes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UN net meeting 'hit by hackers' causing website disruption,"The World Conference on International Telecommunications (Wcit) is debating changes to a wide-ranging communications treaty. Delegates were unable to access material relating to the meeting after its website was forced offline. Hacker groups had claimed responsibility, organisers said. The UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) said delegates had been left ""frustrated"" by the disruption, which lasted for about two hours on Wednesday. ""However, a spirit of camaraderie prevailed,"" it said in a statement. ""With those who had access to up-to-date online versions of the texts willingly sharing with other delegates in order to keep discussions moving forward."" Deep packet ITU Secretary General Hamadoun Toure criticised those responsible for the downtime. ""It is ironic that the very people who claim to be fighting for a free internet are preventing those around the world trying to follow the event online from getting access,"" he said. ""Do they believe in one rule for them, and one for everyone else?"" The apparent hack attack follows the approval of a new standard for deep packet inspection by a meeting last month of the World Telecommunication Standardisation Assembly. The technique is used by telecom operators to get an overview of the number of blocked or dropped calls, and other traffic issues. But it can also be used to spy on individual customers to see which sites they visit and how much data they use. The Center for Democracy & Technology expressed concern at its approval. ""The telecommunications standards arm of the UN has quietly endorsed the standardisation of technologies that could give governments and companies the ability to sift through all of an internet user's traffic - including emails, banking transactions, and voice calls - without adequate privacy safeguards,"" the group said in a statement. ""The move suggests that some governments hope for a world where even encrypted communications may not be safe from prying eyes."" US concern The US later noted that the standard's introduction had been a private sector initiative, adding the United States would oppose it being used to monitor individuals as that would be ""an invasion of privacy"". The country's ambassador to Wcit added that he was ""very concerned"" by the apparent hack attack. ""There has been a big focus on transparency at this conference and the ITU has made all the main plenary discussions available via webcasting,"" said Terry Kramer. ""They've posted the proposals on their site. So taking that site down creates an impression that there isn't transparency.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer',"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Trial results coming out of a US cancer conference suggest the treatment works better than standard chemotherapy. Nivolumab significantly improved the survival odds of patients with these hard-to-treat tumours. It is already available on the NHS for people with advanced skin cancer. But experts say more research is needed before offering it routinely to patients with other cancers. New hope Immunotherapy is seen as one of the most exciting developments in cancer treatments in years. While it cannot cure every cancer, mounting evidence suggests it can buy some very ill patients valuable time. The phase-three trial of nivolumab, presented at the American Association of Cancer Research, suggests the drug can extend survival time by months, even when the cancer is advanced and aggressive. In the trial, 240 patients with head and neck cancer were given nivolumab, while another 121 were given standard chemotherapy. After a year, 36% of patients treated with nivolumab injections were still alive compared with 17% of those on chemo. UK trial leader Prof Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said the results were ""a potential game changer"" for head and neck cancer, ""introducing a new drug treatment into our armoury that at last is better than standard chemotherapy"". ""Once it has relapsed or spread, head and neck cancer is extremely difficult to treat, with surgery and radiotherapy often impossible,"" he said. ""So it's very good news for patients that these interim results indicate we now have a new treatment that works, and can significantly extend life."" About 10,000 patients a year in the UK are diagnosed with a head or neck cancer - cancer of the mouth, lips, voice box, throat, nose, sinuses and salivary glands. Dr Emma King, of Cancer Research UK, said: ""These results could have a significant impact for head and neck cancer patients who no longer respond to treatment. ""They also reinforce the important shift that we are seeing towards using immunotherapies for cancer treatment. ""Before Nivolumab can be used routinely to treat head and neck cancer in the UK, it will need to approved by NICE [the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence].""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brexit: Further clashes over work on NI port controls,"By Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The controls are currently used for checks on agri-food products and animals. In July, the UK confirmed it intended to put border control posts at Northern Ireland's ports. Work to expand the posts was then requested by the government. However, it is understood Environment Minister Edwin Poots has taken the view that to press ahead with the expansion of current point of entry controls would be a waste of public resources after the latest UK Internal Market Bill. The new bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. There has been controversy over the bill explicitly stating that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. However, ministers say it is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if trade deal negotiations with the EU fail. In a letter to Mr Poots, the Westminster Environment Secretary George Eustice set out what work is required to expand controls at Northern Ireland's ports. Details have not been published and in a statement, Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs stated ""this matter is currently being considered by the executive and it is inappropriate to comment further"". Stormont officials are concerned any ministerial order to pause work on the points of entry could be in breach of the Northern Ireland Act. The act - which underpins the Stormont executive - gives the Northern Ireland secretary the power to order a minister or department to take an action if he believes it is required to fulfil the UK's international obligations. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party argue that proceeding with work on the controls is required to fulfil the executive's international obligations. The matter was put to a cross-community vote during a late session of the executive on Thursday night. No authorisation was given for the environment minister to pause the work. The executive adjourned its discussions on Thursday night in order to obtain legal advice. Ministers resumed their proceedings on Friday evening and further discussions are expected in the coming week.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Zika virus: 'Strongest evidence yet' of effect on babies,"Dr Tom Frieden, head of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), was testifying before politicians in Washington. He said that data from the cases of two infants in Brazil who died soon after birth indicated the virus had passed from mother to child. However, he said the suspected link was still not definite. There are thought to have been more than 4,000 cases in Brazil alone of babies born with microcephaly - abnormally small brains - and where the transmission of Zika virus from mother to child is suspected of being the cause. Dr Frieden said intensive research was under way to find out much more about the mosquito-borne virus and to develop a vaccine for it, although he warned that that could still be years away. ""We will likely see significant numbers of [Zika] cases in Puerto Rico and other US territories,"" Dr Frieden warned. He said the CDC would issue grants to US states at risk of Zika to better control mosquitoes. Also on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO), which has called the outbreak a ""global public health emergency"", issued guidance for women on how to protect themselves. It said that until more is known on whether sexual contact can transmit Zika, ""all men and women living in or returning from an area where Zika is present - especially pregnant women and their partners - should be counselled on the potential risks of sexual transmission and ensure safe sexual practices"". ""These include the correct and consistent use of condoms, one of the most effective methods of protection against all sexually transmitted infections,"" the WHO said. The use of contraception is a controversial issue in the region because of the Catholic Church's stance against it. However, the Church has rejected calls from liberal Catholics for a softening of its position on the issue in light of the outbreak. ""Microcephaly has been occurring in Brazil for years.

Sound Of 2018 stars to play exclusive gig,"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The 21-year-old will play an intimate, ticketed set for Radio 1 at the BBC's Maida Vale studios on 30 January. She'll be joined by other Sound of 2018 acts including Pale Waves, Not3s, Yxng Bane and runner-up Rex Orange County. Sound of 2015 winners Years & Years will also play the event, marking their comeback after a year in the studio. DJ Annie Mac will broadcast the show, dubbed BBC Music Sound of 2018 Live, on BBC Radio 1. She called it ""one of the first opportunities to see and hear some of the most exciting new artists in 2018"". Fans can register for tickets from now until Thursday, 18 January. Sigrid won the Sound of 2018 last week, after receiving votes from more than 170 music industry insiders, including DJs, critics, festival bookers and fellow musicians. She looks set to enter the UK Top 10 for the first time this week, with her single Strangers climbing to number eight in Monday's Official Chart Update. The star said she was ""very excited"" to play ""alongside some great artists"" at the first-ever Sound Of... concert. The annual list was established in 2003, with the aim of highlighting music's ""next big things"". Previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith, Haim, Jessie J and Ellie Goulding; while the likes of Stormzy, Lady Gaga and Frank Ocean have all featured in the Top 10. BBC Sound of 2018 - the top five 1) SIGRID Taught to play piano at an early age, Sigrid didn't consider writing her own music until she was 16, when her brother demanded she stopped playing Adele covers. She quickly discovered a talent for indelible pop melodies, switching confidently between fragile ballads and feisty pop bangers. 2) REX ORANGE COUNTY Nineteen-year-old Alex O'Connor is a former chorister and Brit School graduate, whose bedroom productions were inspired by a love of classic songwriters like Stevie Wonder. His heartfelt vocals have been sought out by the likes of Tyler, The Creator and Skepta, who invited him on stage at last year's Mercury Prize. 3) IAMDDB Manchester's Diana DeBrito, aka IAMDDB, fuses reflective, soulful vocals with trap beats and jazz melodies. She dropped her first track just over a year ago, on the same day she quit university after just an hour. 4) KHALID Aged just 19, Khalid is already a star in the US, where his debut album American Teen has sold more than a million copies. His emotional, relatable songs are a diary of his high school years, full of love, loss, loneliness and longing. 5) PALE WAVES Manchester goth-pop band Pale Waves were formed at university by best friends and musical soulmates Heather Baron-Gracie (vocals, guitars) and Ciara Doran (drums). Championed by The 1975, who took them on tour last year, they describe their sound as ""90s-inspired indie-pop feels, drenched in reverb and glitter"".

Mariam Moustafa death: Family not told about court case,"Mariam Moustafa, 18, fell into a coma following the attack in Nottingham last February and later died of a stroke. Her father Mohamed said authorities showed ""no respect"" for the family, who did not know about the hearing. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it was ""deeply sorry"" for not informing the Moustafas. Miss Moustafa was punched and kicked during a confrontation with the group of teenagers near a bus stop in Upper Parliament Street on 20 February 2018. The engineering student suffered a stroke 10 hours after the attack and died on 14 March 2018. The attack caused uproar in Egypt, from where the family originates, and the country's embassy had called on those responsible to be ""brought to justice swiftly"". Mariah Fraser, 19, Britania Hunter, 18, and a 16-year-old girl, admitted their part in the attack at a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court on 16 April this year, but the victim's family was unaware of the court appearance. Mr Moustafa, 51, from Nottingham, said: ""We should have been informed of that hearing date and time and we should have been given the opportunity to attend. This very simple right was taken from us. ""I'm very upset. Nobody respects me and my family."" The family's legal representative said an official complaint has been made. Mr Moustafa said the family had found it difficult to cope with Mariam's death. ""I do my best to try and keep strong but it is not easy for me and my family. ""Before I was working and I don't have any problems. Since this happened I have lots of problems with everything."" In a statement the CPS said it was ""deeply sorry"" Mr Moustafa was not informed. ""We have contacted him to offer a full explanation,"" a spokesman said. ""We were preparing for trial in this case, two of the three guilty pleas were unexpected and we informed the family immediately."" Three other women and girls aged 18, 17 and 16 pleaded guilty to affray at Nottingham Youth Court last year. All six offenders will be sentenced on a date still to be set.

HS2 underground protest: Activists 'being forced out' of tunnel,"HS2 Rebellion, who are camped out at Euston Square Gardens, say the team is burrowing a vertical tunnel causing crumbs of earth to fall around them. The activists dug tunnels to thwart their eviction from a protest camp. HS2 declined to comment but has previously said all activities to protect the protesters would be safe. The protesters, who said the eviction team was also digging above their heads, have refused to say how many people are underground but say they are confident they can last several more days. Some of the group who were outside the tunnels have been arrested. One protester said: ""All night we've had rocks falling down on to our head through the gaps. ""They've kept us awake all night for hours and hours and hours to keep us awake and try and coax us out of the hole. ""All of the dirt is still coming down in my sleeves. It's not the most pleasant of experiences, it's pretty nasty to be fair."" In September, the group set up a Tree Protection Camp in the gardens in protest against the Â£106bn HS2 scheme. The campaigners allege that the small green space near Euston station will be built over with a temporary taxi rank, before being sold to developers, as part of plans for the high-speed railway. The eviction team has now removed the roof from the structure which protected the front of the tunnel. Meanwhile, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have urged the government to reconsider the HS2 project, saying the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed the economic case for the high-speed rail line. The railway was signed off by Prime Minister Boris Johnson almost a year ago before travel plummeted as a result of the virus and people turned to home working and Zoom. The protesters say the project will prove a waste of money. A government spokesman said HS2 would continue because and form a vital part of the UK's future infrastructure. Roger Harrabin, BBC News Environment Analyst: Most people think of trains as being cleaner than cars and that's generally true. But in the case of HS2, there's a new track to be carved through the countryside and that has changed the equation. That's because of the vast quantities of carbon emitted during the construction of the line, with all its steel, and cement, and its huge construction machines. HS2 first estimated it would take more than 100 years to repay this ""carbon debt"" before the line started to save CO2 - that's way beyond what UK climate targets demand. The firm has now withdrawn that calculation, but not offered another figure. And now there's another factor at play: the seismic shift in travel patterns following the coronavirus pandemic and the Zoom revolution. HS2 was designed to serve increased passenger numbers. Protesters say there's such uncertainty about future travel that building the line now looks a Â£100bn gamble.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bishop Peter Ball victim withdraws from church abuse review,"Peter Ball, 84, was jailed in October for offences against 18 teenagers and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. One of his victims, Rev Graham Sawyer, said he had taken the decision because ""bullying and silencing"" were not in the terms of reference of the review. The Church said the Ball case ""was a matter of deep shame and regret"". In February, it was announced Dame Moira Gibb was chairing an independent review of the Ball case to consider what information was available to the Church, who had it and when. 'Worrying signal' Mr Sawyer waived his right to anonymity before Ball, former Bishop of Lewes and Gloucester, was sentenced to 32 months in prison. He said he objected to the fact the treatment he received from current senior officials in the church would not be covered by the terms of reference of the inquiry. In a letter to Dame Moira, he states: ""I realise that decisions over terms of reference are not your prerogative. ""Nevertheless, that there has clearly been resistance to suggestions of them specifically mentioning bullying, vilification and silencing, sends a worrying but sadly very predictable signal from the Church of England at its very highest levels that these systemically vital matters are not going to be addressed with the fundamental importance they deserve. ""Please inform Archbishop Welby that I therefore decline to give evidence to the review he has established because of the failure of the terms of reference to be amended to include bullying and silencing with a plea for him personally to reconsider this."" 'Sympathetic to plight' Further correspondence seen by the BBC suggests Mr Sawyer rejected the offer of a discussion with the Church's national safeguarding officer, Graham Tilby, because he was dissatisfied with the church's response to complaints he had made. Church of England sources said Dame Moira had no powers to compel witnesses to attend and was sympathetic to his plight. A spokeswoman for the Church said it had offered an ""unreserved apology to all the survivors"" and ""commended the bravery"" of those who brought allegations against the former bishop. ""Archbishop Justin has publicly said it is a matter of deep shame and regret that a bishop in the Church of England committed these offences and there are no excuses whatsoever for what took place and the systematic abuse of trust perpetrated by Peter Ball over decades. ""The Review, which started in February and is expected to last a year, will provide the Church as a whole with an opportunity to learn lessons which will improve our safeguarding practice and policy."" Mr Sawyer visited the former bishop as a teenager in the 1970s. He said Ball tried to take off his clothes and wanted an ""act of commitment"" if he was to be ordained. Mr Sawyer described Ball as a ""monster"" who controlled him with a ""cloak of spirituality"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gareth Bayliss presents debut exhibition at Ipswich Art School,"Richard HaughBBC News Bayliss, 35, studied at Ipswich Art School, which is now a gallery, before providing designs for clients including Dizzee Rascal, Mo Wax, Stussy and Habitat. Bayliss, who also teaches at Norwich University's College of the Arts, has continued his relationship with the art school by running a weekend art club for children. Meanwhile, Return to the Ipswich Art School showcases some of his prints, t-shirts, record sleeves and sketch pads filled with original drawings. ""It's been really difficult to pull together,"" said Bayliss, who spent four months organising the show with the help of Julia Devonshire, arts project officer for Ipswich Borough Council. ""What do I want to say? Who's this for? ""I want to show as many processes as I know, to be diverse as possible and introduce the new work. ""I've been hiding it all away, I'm quite reclusive. I do have blogs which I put stuff on, but so much of this isn't on there."" Swarms Visitors to the exhibition are greeted by a wall boasting an ad hoc display of small arrows. The organised scattering of the shape, inspired by Bayliss' love of watching starlings, has become a bit of a trademark for the artist. The exhibition features two elaborate aluminium cuttings and several screen prints with variants of the design. ""They take weeks to do,"" he said. ""They're cut from vinyl so I have to pick every arrow out by hand with a scalpel. ""It's that thing with graphic design about being a perfectionist and taking too long with things. Maybe this justifies it as being good."" ""My design is a craft I think. ""It's important that people can make a differentiation about it being a craft and it not being a 'smash it out' graphic design thing."" Other artists Bayliss says the new work amongst his collection shows a move away from graphic design. One shows a shape similar to the hoods warn by falcons, drawn in marker pen and repeated without the pen leaving the paper. ""It's a nerdy test to start from one point and go round with one continuous line,"" he said. ""It's about constantly re-branding, which I know is my industry graphic design talk. I've switched career now and don't really get the buzz from graphic design."" Bayliss says his main aim with his work is to enjoy experimenting and to ""embrace the happy accidents"". ""We're making stuff, let's not question it too much,"" he said. ""When you get through art education you're questioning it a bit too much."" One wall of the exhibition has been reserved for Bayliss's friends. Mister Millerchip will be on show at some point, but Lee Barnard is first on display. Barnard, also known as El Chucko, is a well-respected illustrator, but this is the first time his work has been at a gallery. ""They're amazing drawings,"" said Bayliss. ""That crazy wall probably took longer to draw than all my work combined."" Return to Ipswich Art School is on until March 2012.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Glan Clwyd Hospital: Disciplinary action promised by Jones,"Carwyn Jones was speaking as it emerged the health minister's statement on the Tawel Fan scandal had been withdrawn. Instead ministers will back a call from the Conservatives for a debate on failings at the Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital on Wednesday. Families said patients were treated like animals in a zoo. An independent report said a string of allegations, which it found proven, amounted to ""institutional abuse"". A Welsh government source said the decision to support a debate was taken ""in full recognition of the strength of feeling across the chamber on the issue"". In the report published last Thursday, families described seeing patients ""constantly crawling on dirty floors"" and being ""like a zombie...drugged up"". One family said they found a relative in bed in a pool of stale urine. The report's author, health specialist Donna Ockenden, criticised a lack of action by the senior leadership team when problems had been flagged up in previous reports. 'Not good enough' Answering AMs' questions on Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones described the findings as ""shocking"" and ""appalling"" but said recently-introduced spot checks offered some reassurance. ""The results of those spot checks show that whilst there are some issues in some of those units, we can have some assurance that there is nothing equivalent happening in mental health units across the rest of Wales,"" he said. Mr Jones also outlined what the families of those affected by events at the unit can now expect from Betsi Cadwaldr health board. ""The local health board (LHB) will take disciplinary action against those who are responsible,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough to say that lessons have been learned and nobody bears responsibility within the LHB. ""I do not think that is a credible position for the LHB to be in and I don't think that the families will accept that for one minute."" Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies criticised Mr Jones for taking five days to respond to the report, saying: ""You are the first minister of Wales, the buck stops with you"". Mr Jones said it was appropriate to express a view in the assembly chamber, rather than ""on Twitter"". 'Real accountability' Betsi Cadwaladr health board has apologised and a number of staff have been suspended or transferred to other duties. Earlier on Tuesday, Plaid Cymru Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the health board needed ""further intervention"" from ministers, but it was ""too early"" to say what form the intervention should take. He said there were ""real concerns"" about the health board's size, distance from people and ""lack of accountability"". On Monday, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called on Mr Drakeford to ""show some leadership"", saying the families concerned wanted to see ""real accountability"" and someone to ""lose their job"" over the scandal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Alstom: GE and French state agree to work on new offer,"France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg said that neither the GE bid, nor a joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer, met the government's demands. But the government had chosen to work on a new GE bid that would involve the French state buying a stake in Alstom. ""The Siemens-MHI offer was serious but the government has made up its mind,"" Mr Montebourg told a news conference. The new deal being worked on with GE would mean the French state buying a 20% stake in Alstom from main shareholder Bouygues. He said that key decision-making centres of the Alstom group would remain in France, a key issue for the French government, which insists that any takeover should preserve jobs. Alstom has been at the centre of a bid battle for several months after Francois Hollande's government objected to the US company buying one of the jewels of French engineering. After talks with the government, Siemens and Mitsubishi raised their offer to buy Alstom, increasing the cash component of their bid by 1.2bn euros to 8.2bn euros (Â£6.6bn; $11.2bn). The improved offer raises the valuation of Alstom's energy business by 400m euros to 14.6bn euros. The move by Siemens and Mitsubishi came just a day after GE sweetened its offer. On Thursday, GE proposed creating a joint venture with the firm's nuclear and energy businesses and to sell its profitable rail signalling business to Alstom. However, it did not increase its $17bn bid. Alstom, which feels that its energy businesses - which range from wind power to turbines for nuclear reactors - is not large enough to compete globally, originally approached GE. When the government learned of the advanced talks to sell the power business, it objected on the grounds that jobs and decision-making could be lost and encouraged Germany's Siemens to make a counter offer, hoping that a Siemens-Alstom tie-up would create a global-scale European group. Siemens then linked up with Mitsubishi to present a rival offer. Alstom, which employs 18,000 people in France out of a total 90,000 worldwide, is an important issue for the French president, who is battling to reduce a huge trade deficit, record unemployment and whose approval ratings have dropped to record lows.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Covid: New lockdown needed, say Yorkshire leaders","Schools in England have shut to most pupils and people have been asked to stay at home under tighter rules. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said it was ""the only way we will save lives and prevent our NHS and hospitals from being overwhelmed."" The lockdown rules are due to last until at least mid-February. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the coming weeks would be the ""hardest yet"". It comes after the UK reported a record 58,784 cases on Monday, as well as a further 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Announcing the lockdown, Mr Johnson said hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"". Mr Jarvis had called for a ""comprehensive package of financial support for workers and businesses"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak has since announced a grant scheme for retail, hospitality and leisure, as part of a measures worth Â£4.6bn across the UK. Susan Hinchcliffe, Labour leader of Bradford Council, said the tougher measures were ""inevitable"" even though infection rates in the city had fallen. ""We're all one country and we know national lockdowns work to get infection rates down. ""I really feel for the businesses who will be affected by this latest lockdown."" Mr Sunak has said Â£594m will be made available through local authorities for businesses outside the retail, hospitality and leisure industries. Scarborough and Whitby Conservative MP Robert Goodwill said the new lockdown would pose ""great challenges"" for people. ""We wouldn't make these decisions unless it was absolutely necessary to control the disease and keep the level of hospital admissions at a rate they can cope with, while at the same time rolling out the vaccination programme."" He added: ""It is going to have great challenges for those people who can't work from home and who have to arrange childcare."" In Wakefield, council leader Denise Jeffery said the district had seen an increase in infection rates and said the authority would ""do everything possible to support residents and business"". Hull West and Hessle MP Emma Hardy said a fast and effective Covid vaccination plan must be given priority. ""Everything, all of our national efforts, all of our energy, all of our resources, must be pushed into vaccinating people as quickly as possible and as many as possible,"" she added. Staff at a gym in York said there would be an impact on people's mental health. Frankii Newberry, a personal trainer at Dominus Crossfit said ""We are beyond heartbroken, we're exhausted, we're drained and we're all extremely concerned for our members and for how our bills are going to get paid now.""

Bloodhound takes first drive across the desert,"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent Pilot Andy Green took the jet-powered vehicle on a gentle 100mph (160km/h) shakedown test run on Friday. Bloodhound is in Northern Cape for high-speed trials as it works towards an assault on the land speed record next year. That mark - of 763mph (1,228km/h) - was set 22 years ago, also by Andy Green, in the Thrust SSC car. Thrust broke the sound barrier in the process - the first, and only, car to have achieved the feat. Bloodhound will be run at progressively faster and faster speeds in the coming days as engineers seek to verify its design and the proper working of its subsystems. With a Eurofighter jet engine onboard, it should be capable of reaching 500-600mph (800-965km/h) this year. The addition of a rocket motor in 2020 ought then to take the car over 800mph (1,290km/h). Engineers will be looking in particular at how much drag Bloodhound is producing in these trials. This will determine the level of thrust they will need from the rocket. They will also be checking that the parachutes and brakes can bring the car safely to a stop at the end of a high-speed run. Up to a dozen runs are planned between now and mid November, with the first six taking the speed up in steps of 50mph (80km/h). The desert floor has been painted to mark out an array of parallel tracks. End to end, these are about 16km (10 miles) long. The Bloodhound project is led from the UK but is being hosted by the Northern Cape government. Local people have cleared Hakskeen Pan of stones. The hope is this flat lakebed can become a draw for other racers in the future. The trials are only happening because of the intervention of Yorkshire businessman Ian Warhurst. He rescued Bloodhound from financial collapse earlier this year and is personally underwriting the four to six-week programme. He won't say precisely how much he's put into the project; ""seven figures"" is what he tells journalists. But he believes every penny to be worth it. Mr Warhurst's calculation is that once the world sees the car running at high-speed, sponsors will come forward to carry the effort through a land speed record attempt.

"Farm profits may halve after Brexit, says report","The report, by the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), says the ""worst-case scenario"" would cut average farm profits from Â£38,000 a year to just Â£15,000. The analysis tries to model the effects of cheaper imported food, reduced subsidies and more expensive labour. A government spokesman said the report was based on highly unlikely scenarios. The UK is due to leave the European Union (EU) in March 2019. Some formal negotiations with the EU started in June, but so far, it is unclear how trade between the UK and the EU will change if the Brexit timetable is met. In fact, the specific negotiations over a future trade deal have not even started. But they will be particularly vital to the agricultural and horticultural industries because of the subsidies which are received under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). 'Hypothetical scenarios' A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""This report is based on hypothetical and highly unlikely scenarios that do not reflect the government's negotiating position. ""Outside the EU and free from the bureaucracy of the Common Agricultural Policy, our farmers will be able to focus on growing, selling and exporting more fantastic produce."" The AHDB research looked at three possible outcomes of Brexit: ""Under the three scenarios outlined in the report, changes in the UK's trade relationships will impact farmers' bottom line when the UK leaves the single market, whether or not a free trade agreement is negotiated with the EU,"" said the Board. 'Dramatic immediate impact' The CAP gives UK farmers Â£3.1bn a year which, on the face of it, will disappear after Brexit, though the UK government has guaranteed to maintain ""overall"" farm subsidies or payments at the same level until 2022. AHDB, a statutory body funded by a levy on the agricultural industry, said Brexit would inevitably have a ""dramatic immediate impact"" on farm sectors that rely most on subsidies. The effects of Brexit will not be uniform, though, and the position will be complex, depending on the sector and scenario being modelled. Dairy and pig farmers may benefit from rising prices, the report says. On the other hand, significant exporters such as cereal producers and sheep farmers would suffer due to the increased cost of exporting products to the EU. And where businesses rely on migrant workers, higher employment costs due to more stringent immigration restrictions will also push up farmers' costs dramatically, especially in horticulture. An AHDB spokeswoman said there were thought to be between 50,000 and 80,000 EU nationals working in UK agriculture and horticulture, in both permanent and seasonal jobs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Will Margaret Ferrier remain an MP after breaking rules?,"By Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent Ms Ferrier has been suspended by her party and she has faced criticism across the political spectrum, with the Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross saying she should be expelled. And her now former party, the SNP, are insisting she has to quit parliament for breaking coronavirus restrictions. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Telegraph she should do the ""honourable thing"". Nicola Sturgeon repeated her call for Ms Ferrier to quit - and in an unfortunate slip of the tongue referred to her as ""Margaret Covid"". However the former SNP MP George Kerevan has offered a limited defence. Although he said her actions were wrong, he wrote: ""I feel deeply for Margaret and find much of the virtue signalling and rush to consign her to political outer darkness both hypocritical and blatantly self-serving. Margaret Ferrier, in my experience, always put the job before her personal convenience."" Is she going to? I've spoken to several people who know Ms Ferrier and there doesn't seem to be a definite answer. The BBC has tried to contact Ms Ferrier and her office repeatedly without success. Several people we have contacted in the party have not spoken to her since last week. Ms Ferrier has said nothing publicly since she issued a statement on Thursday revealing she had travelled from Scotland to London after showing symptoms, then back again after getting a positive test result. It seems she may still be deciding what to do - or keeping it to herself. It's worth remembering Ms Ferrier has coronavirus - and we don't know for sure how ill she is. So what now? Many of her former SNP colleagues and her political opponents are discussing how they could force her out if she refuses to stand down. Senior figures in the SNP have suggested she is likely to face a recall procedure - which could see her forced out of office. There are three ways that process begins: Police are currently investigating the case and it has been referred to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate. However, both of those processes could be lengthy. The stated penalty for breaking self-isolation rules in England is a fine - although under the MP's Code of Conduct MPs are expected to ""uphold the law"". If any of the conditions are met, a petition would be opened in Ms Ferrier's constituency. If 10% of registered voters signed it within six weeks then a by-election would be called. The process has been used three times since it was created. Two MPs have been successfully recalled - former Labour MP Fiona Onasanya and former Tory MP Chris Davies. In the case of the DUP's Ian Paisley Jnr, a petition was launched but the 10 per cent threshold was not met and he remains an MP.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UKIP make their mark in Scotland,"Brian TaylorPolitical editor, Scotland So, quite deliberately, I grabbed the chance today to offer my congratulations to each of Scotland's elected MEPs among the throng gathered in Edinburgh City Chambers for the final declaration. And commiseration to those who lost out. During that peregrination, you could see the election written in countenance. The naÃ¯ve joy of UKIP at their first Scottish elected politician. The defiant pain of the Lib Dems. The relative delight of the Tories at adding to their voting share - the best Euro performance, said their leader Ruth Davidson since she was ten. Which seems only yesterday to those of us of slightly longer pedigree. Labour? Vote up, same two seats. Greens? Vote up, no seats. And the SNP? They topped the poll. They came first. They won the election. No doubt. They got the most votes. What's not to like? Two things. A slight, very slight, decline in their voting share from five years ago. And, secondly, what I heard one Nationalist describe as the ""bitter sweet"" element of the outcome. They had set out to win three seats and, concomitantly, to deprive UKIP of an electoral stake in Scotland. They did neither. This provoked a paradoxical response from supporters of the Union in other parties. They dislike UKIP. They loathe UKIP. At a UK level, UKIP represent an intrinsic challenge to their votes. But, in Scotland, such supporters of the Union would - on balance, just, all things considered - prefer UKIP to take a seat if the alternative is a discernible SNP advance. Teeth clenched, they say that a UKIP victory - just, perhaps, maybe - suggests that Scotland is not so distinctive from England, politically, as has been suggested. That leads Labour, for example, to argue for a ""progressive"" counter to UKIP rather than independence. Nonsense, say the Nationalists. Scotland has voted in an entirely different way - with UKIP receiving a third of the support they registered in England and well behind their vote in Wales. Scotland needs and requires independence. That story can still be told - and will still be told. It's just that the narrative might have been a fraction easier for the SNP if they had indeed pre-empted a UKIP gain. Was it a tactical error by the SNP to target UKIP in the final days of campaigning? Yes, say Labour and others. No, say SNP strategists. They needed to energise their vote and prevent Labour from overhauling the SNP. UKIP provided the conduit. Does it tell us very much about the referendum? Not really. That will be fought on different terms, with different tactics, different issues - and a much bigger turnout. Again, though, to the winners: well done.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Zero waste society plans for Scotland unveiled,"Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said it was time to tackle nearly 20m tonnes of waste currently produced by Scotland every year. The zero waste plan includes tough new recycling and landfill targets over the next 15 years. But some environmentalists say it could lead to the construction of a wave of new incinerators across Scotland. New measures will include landfill bans for specific types of waste and separate collections of some waste to boost re-use and recycling opportunities. A new 70% target has been set for all waste to be recycled by 2025 and a maximum 5% target for all waste to be sent to landfill by the same year. Speaking at the official launch in Edinburgh, Mr Lochhead said the zero waste plan would also help deliver progressive landfill bans. It is hoped that no waste with re-use or recycling potential will be placed in landfill by 2020. He also argued that the plan could deliver major benefits to the economy as well as the environment. ""Scotland is embarking on the zero waste journey to protect our environment and help our economy. We can't go on as business as usual because we can't afford to and because resources are finite,"" he said. ""In recent years, the people of Scotland have made substantial progress in cutting waste but households, businesses and wider society still produce enough waste to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool every 10 minutes."" The plan drew a mixed response from environmentalists and analysts. Environmental impact Mark O'Dowd, a solicitor with international law firm, HBJ Gateley Wareing, said that in order to meet Scottish government and European Union objectives, Â£6.5bn would have to be spent up to 2025 to deliver a zero waste target. ""What is required is clear investment on next generation infrastructure, in the likes of energy from waste plants, recycling plants and an overhaul of rubbish collections, as well as improving grid connections,"" he said. He said the planning system would need to be streamlined and failure to achieve the statutory targets would have a damaging environmental impact and would hit the taxpayer hard through EU fines. Scottish local authorities welcomed the publication of the plan. But some environmentalists said they were concerned at the prospect of more incinerators being built. Green MSP Robin Harper told BBC Scotland he believed a zero waste strategy could be achieved but he remained worried that a 25% cap on incineration of waste could ""turn into a target"". He added: ""For every tonne of waste we could make about Â£600 in recycled products if we could get all the system working. If we burn it, we are only going to get Â£20 worth of electricity out of it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Views sought on new ideas to further regenerate Cardiff,"The proposals have been outlined in a consultation which splits the city into five areas for different types of development. Replacing the Motorpoint Arena along with creating an innovation park and a science park have also been mooted. The public has three months to give their views to Cardiff council. The authority believes the ideas will help the city be a more connected and attractive place for people to live, work and visit. It published the ""Building More and Better Jobs"" and wants people's views before taking it forward. Cardiff Bay The area has been earmarked for leisure and could be the home of an art gallery, as well as the Cardiff Story museum and where the Motorpoint Arena relocates from the city centre. The council wants to build on the redevelopment of the Coal Exchange by improving the rest of Mount Stuart Square. It is also where the equivalent of the High Line - a raised urban park on a former railway track - could link the Bay and city centre. City centre Much of the plans for the city centre are already under way including Central Square where the new BBC Wales headquarters will be based, and a new bus station has been promised. The site of the Brains Brewery will also be redeveloped and further improvements are due to be made to Cardiff Central railway station. More office and public spaces feature in the proposals. Cardiff East Industry would take centre stage in this area with a new Cardiff Parkway station already mooted and work continuing on the Eastern Bay link road. But a new business park and space for distribution centres would help to provide more jobs in the area, according to the plans. Cardiff West With the Cardiff City Stadium and other sporting facilities nearby including Cardiff International Sports Village proving successful, there could also be a new home for Cardiff Blues. Facilities at Glamorgan Cricket Club and Sport Wales would be upgraded too. Cardiff North Innovation is the key word for this area with an innovation park which would cover Maindy Park and the University Hospital of Wales. A science park would be developed just off the M4 at Coryton while improved transport would create better links with communities, the proposals say. Russell Goodway, the council's cabinet member for investment and development wants as many people as possible to participate in the in the consultation. ""This is designed to attract business investment and jobs, develop much needed infrastructure and most importantly ensure that the improvements that are made benefit the people of Cardiff,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that we need to be better connected by improving the transport infrastructure, create more better paid jobs; tackle the issues of inequality and be smart both by embracing technology improvements as well as responding intelligently to the issues that a city has to deal with.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kashmir uproar over Afzal Guru clemency plea,"By Mehboob KhanBBC News A resolution had been tabled on the case of Afzal Guru, who was convicted over the 2001 India parliament attack. Sheikh Rashid, the independent who brought the resolution, said the state's leadership had done ""great damage"" to the Kashmir cause. Guru, who says he is innocent, faces death by hanging. ""At least they could have passed the resolution and the final decision was lying on the central government,"" Sheikh Rashid told the BBC. He believes the state's political leaders should have supported his resolution, which he hoped would publicise Guru's case. Instead, the debate, scheduled for Wednesday, did not take place for lack of time. Sheikh Rashid spoke to the BBC from hospital where he was being treated for minor injuries after police removed him from protests in front of the assembly. ""All the parties in the state were tied up in a nexus as they act on the orders of Delhi,"" he said. Legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party stalled proceedings, demanding the debate be dropped. Sheikh Rashid said executing Guru could have ""serious consequences"". Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani has also warned of major unrest if Guru is executed. Opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti blamed the state's governing National Conference and Congress parties for sabotaging the debate. She told the BBC that Chief Minister Omar Abdullah ""could do nothing to stop the uproar and start the debate on the resolution, except keep smiling"". Controversy The December 2001 attack was one of the most controversial incidents in recent Indian history. India blamed the attack on the Jaish-e-Mohammed militant group, which it said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement in the attack but relations between the two countries nosedived as their armies massed about a million troops along the border. Mohammed Afzal was one of two men sentenced to death. But the punishment for Shaukat Hussain was later reduced to 10 years in jail on appeal. Two other accused in the case, SAR Geelani and Afsan Guru, were acquitted for lack of evidence. Afzal Guru's appeal was refused by the Supreme Court and his appeal now rests with the president. Families of policemen killed in the attack have demanded Afzal Guru's immediate hanging.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Robin Gibb: Bee Gees singer's funeral held in Thame,"Hundreds of fans lined the streets of Thame earlier as a lone bagpiper led a procession through the town. Gibb's body was carried in a horse-drawn carriage, followed by two Irish wolfhounds and guests, including his brother Barry and broadcaster Paul Gambaccini. Gibb, 62, died of kidney failure in May after battling cancer and pneumonia. The horse-drawn carriage passed through the town prior to a private church service attended by his family and close friends being held. 'Beautiful heart' His family said his wish was to say a ""final goodbye"" to fans and the town. Barry Gibb, the only surviving member of the Bee Gees trio, told the congregation in St Mary's Church: ""Life is too short. In Robin's case, absolutely too short. ""We should have had 20 years, 30 years of his magnificent mind and his beautiful heart."" Referring to the large turn-out for the funeral procession and service, he said: ""So many people loved this boy, so many illustrious people are here that loved him. And that is such a pleasure to witness. ""The three of us have seen a lot of crowds but I've never seen so much love in one crowd as I'm looking at today - for Rob, you know, for the music. And it's an intense experience for me."" Other guests at the service included musician Peter Andre and actor Leslie Phillips. The track Don't Cry Alone, which was one of Gibb's final compositions from his Titanic Requiem - premiered only weeks before his death - was played at the service. 'So special' Radio presenter Henry Wymbs, who has known the Gibb family for a number of years as Robin's wife Dwina was a fan of his Irish Eye programme, said: ""Part of my youth died with him because he created so many of the songs I loved. ""He was humble, down to earth, a very genuine man who wasn't affected by fame or wealth. ""Apparently he had really become a part of the community in Thame and I can believe that because he was such a nice man."" Mayor of Thame Nigel Champken-Woods said: ""He did switch the Christmas lights on a few years ago and he was happy to sign autographs and talk to people."" Bee Gees fan Jill Horton, who had travelled to Thame from Buckingham, said: ""We're big fans, the whole family, right through to my four-year-old granddaughter. ""It was their music that was just so special. ""He was 62 and I'm 61 so I've grown up in that era."" Gibb's musical career began when he formed the Bee Gees with brothers Barry and Maurice in 1958. The group had hits including Stayin' Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, Massachusetts and Night Fever. They made almost 30 albums and sold more than 110 million records.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
More than one in 10 providing unpaid care,"Figures from 2011 show that the largest increase was in unpaid carers working for 50 or more hours a week. Wales had a higher percentage of people providing unpaid care compared with any English region. In England, the highest percentages of unpaid carers were in the North West, North East and West Midlands. The ONS study into unpaid care in England and Wales, 2011 found that more than 12% of the population in Wales provided some level of care in 2011. The rise in those providing over 50 hours a week of unpaid care means that across England and Wales there are now 1.4 million people providing round-the-clock care - an increase of 270,000 people since 2001 (25%). Across local authorities in England and Wales, the number of carers increased in 320 authorities and fell in just six. In Birmingham, the number of unpaid carers increased by more than 9,000 between 2001 and 2011. Across English regions and Wales, the provision of between one and 19 hours was the most common level of care provided. London was the area with the lowest percentage of unpaid carers at 8.4%. The study said London's lower level of care provision was likely to be influenced by its younger age structure, the transient nature of its population and differences in household composition. Family pressure The provision of unpaid care is an important statistic, the ONS says, because unpaid carers make a vital contribution to the supply of care but their role can also affect their employment opportunities as well as their social and leisure activities. Unpaid care means care provided to family members, friends, neighbours or others who are disabled, elderly or have long-term health problems. It does not include people providing general childcare. HelÃ©na Herklots, chief executive of Carers UK said: ""Family life is changing as a result of our ageing population and the fact that people are living longer with disability and long-term ill-health. ""Too often the costs and pressures of caring for older or disabled loved ones can force families to give up work to care and lead to debt, poor health and isolation. ""In addition, as more families need help to care, social care support and disability benefits are being cut. This risks putting even more pressure on families, many of whom are already struggling to cope.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lover jailed for Swanwick car boot murder,"Paula Poolton, 40, of Titchfield, Fareham, was found near Swanwick rail station, Hampshire, on 28 October 2008, 11 days after she went missing. At the Royal Courts of Justice in London Roger Kearney, 57, of Sarisbury Green, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years. The court heard the pair had been having an affair in the summer of 2008. Football stewards Kearney stabbed her to death when she started putting pressure on him to leave his partner, the court was told. He then fabricated an alibi to cover his tracks. Mrs Poolton's husband, Ricky, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and held on bail for five months until he was released without charge. Kearney had worked with Mrs Poolton when they were stewards at Southampton Football Club but her husband and his partner were unaware of the affair. Prosecuting, Nicholas Haggan QC said that Mrs Poolton had told friends she wanted to leave her husband but Kearney was in fact ""tiring"" of the relationship. Mr Haggan said on the day she disappeared Mrs Poolton told her friend Carol Bertie she had been looking for a house to buy to move in with Kearney and was meeting him that night. The jury was told she was prone to going on ""benders"" and her husband did not raise the alarm until a few days after she failed to return home on 17 October. Police soon found out about the affair and questioned Kearney as a witness. Mr Haggan said that significantly he referred to his lover in the past tense on several occasions. The Royal Mail driver also lied about his whereabouts during a crucial hour after Mrs Poolton's Peugeot was last seen on CCTV. Kearney said he had left for a night shift at 2200 BST for the 15-minute drive to work when CCTV footage showed he left home at 2131 BST. He also lied about the route. When he got home after work he washed all his clothing including his fluorescent jacket, jurors were told. Kearney was convicted last week at Winchester Crown Court.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians?,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics Editor Talks aimed at resolving the political deadlock continue at Stormont. The talks are focusing on welfare reform, finance, paramilitary activity and the legacy of the Troubles. It is worth recalling that the Stormont House deal, agreed just under a year ago, fell apart over welfare reform. Sinn FÃ©in walked away from the deal saying mitigating measures for welfare recipients did not go far enough and were less than they understood had been agreed. That interpretation is hotly disputed by the DUP. So what was at issue? The deal should have introduced changes already made across the rest of the UK: The Stormont House deal in essence agreed to introduce all of the above but with significant mitigating measures. These were: In total, all these measures would cost Â£564m over six years, the vast majority of that related to DLA/PIP. What is the Welfare Reform Bill? Responsibility for the welfare system is devolved to Northern Ireland. However, in practice, Northern Ireland has always operated in parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. In 2012, the UK coalition government under David Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed a series of welfare changes known as the Welfare Reform Act. However, Stormont could not agree to implement those changes through its own Welfare Reform Bill. So why did the deal collapse? It was really about the last of the five measures listed above. Sinn FÃ©in said they had been misled about how big the Supplementary Payment Scheme would need to be. Martin McGuinness reckoned it would actually need another Â£200m to protect current and future claimants. Figures in Sinn FÃ©in's Welfare Facts document suggest full compensation would require a ""supplementary fund"" of Â£346m over six years The DUP said it would be ""impossible"" to offer the sort of protection that Sinn FÃ©in were aiming for. So what to look out for in any deal? Have Sinn FÃ©in got any more money for mitigating measures? Recall the party's mantra of protecting ""children with disabilities, adults with severe disabilities, the long-term sick"" - that is really about specific mitigation for the reduction of disability premiums under Universal Credit, the time limiting of contributory ESA and the household benefit cap. Will there be anything specific they can point to on those benefits? Will the party stick to the position that future as well as existing claimants must be protected? And how will the Tax Credits issue play into any pledges on mitigation?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning,"The UK's largest building firm said it expected a shortfall in its UK construction unit, meaning 2014 group pre-tax profits would be ""significantly lower"" than expected. Balfour said group profits would now be between Â£145-Â£160m. It said most other parts of the firm were trading in line with expectations. Balfour said it had appointed current chairman Steve Marshall as executive chairman until it had found a successor for Mr McNaughton. The group said profits in its UK construction business would be Â£30m lower than it had expected in March. The firm said it had taken longer than expected to improve operational issues. It also blamed continuing ""adverse market conditions"" in its mechanical and electrical engineering division as well as ""further costs increases and delays"" in its major building projects division. 'Strategic review' Balfour Beatty said it now planned to carry out a strategic review in a bid to simplify its structure and ""create a more focused group"". As part of the review, it plans a possible sale of its consulting business Parsons Brinckerhoff, but said it would only sell it if it provided ""attractive shareholder value"". ""Having professional services and construction capabilities combined within one organisation has not delivered material competitive advantage for the group,"" Balfour Beatty said in a statement. ""Therefore, we are examining how best to realise the substantial value of the Parsons Brinckerhoff business."" Mr Marshall said: ""Today's trading update is once again disappointing. The board is committed to rapidly addressing the root causes."" Kevin Cammack, an analyst at Cenkos Securities, told the BBC that he felt ""a degree of sympathy"" for Mr McNaughton, who had been in post for just over a year. ""He's obviously taking the fall for the succession of downgrades there have been under his tenure,"" Mr Cammack said. ""The board has obviously had enough of a disappointing market, someone's got to go, and it's the chief executive."" Some of the operational problems with the business predate Mr McNaughton's appointment, he said. In addition, Mr McNaughton may have objected to the possible sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff, Mr Cammack said. Balfour Beatty shares dropped almost 20% during early trading on Tuesday. The drop reflects an effective 20% cut in earnings, and market fears over the effect on dividends, Mr Cammack added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sea lice and disease behind Marine Harvest bid to save Â£44m,"By Douglas FraserBusiness/economy editor, Scotland In Scotland, the company plunged to a 4.5m euro (Â£4m) loss in the final three months of last year. This compared with earnings of 75m euros (Â£67m) at the end of 2016, covering both farming and processing. That is despite an 11% increase in fish harvested, at more than 12,000 tonnes, and premium pricing for Scots salmon. The Norway-based firm is to make 50m euros (Â£44m) of savings, across its international operations. Last year it spent 1.8bn euros on operations (Â£1.6bn). Reduced weight Having shed 34 Scottish jobs last month, Marine Harvest is not expected to focus on job cuts, but on reduced costs in its supply chain, including equipment and feed. Its results for 2017 showed continued problems with sea lice and disease at its fish farms. The worst of these were in Norway, with a sharp rise in the cost of handling sea lice. Fish usually have to be harvested earlier than planned when a site is infested with lice, reducing the weight of fish at the point of harvesting them, and therefore lower earnings that can be made from them. In Scotland, Marine Harvest saw its tonnage increase during the final three months of the year, due to ""biological issues"" - meaning harvesting was brought forward. Among its problems was an outbreak of an infection called pasteurella skyensis, first identified around the Isle of Skye in the 1990s, and occurring again in Scotland during the final three months of last year. In the Norway-based company's annual report, it stated: ""Production in the fourth quarter has been adversely impacted by treatments and mortality. ""While the general fish health situation improved for our Scottish operations during the three first quarters of 2017, the biological performance has been more challenging in the fourth quarter. ""This situation is not expected to improve significantly in the next quarter. Combined with low volumes, costs are expected to remain at the current high level also in the first quarter of 2018"". Global cost savings With disease and lice infestation raising costs per kilogramme, the board stated: ""It is with great concern the Board has viewed the negative cost development for the group. ""Marine Harvest has initiated a global cost savings program of 50 million euros per annum across all business units. ""Accordingly, it is of utmost importance that such initiatives are undertaken and managed closely going forward."" Among developments for the company this year is the opening of a new hatchery near Invermoriston in the central Highlands, and an Â£80m plant for manufacturing fish food, currently under construction at Kyleakin on Skye. Marine Harvest also has major operations in Chile, Canada, the Faroes and Ireland.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Myanmar coup: India asked to return police officers who crossed border,"Indian officials said the officers and their families had crossed the border in recent days. In a letter, Myanmar authorities asked for their return ""in order to uphold friendly relations"". Myanmar has been gripped by mass protests and strikes following a military coup last month. Security forces have taken a hard line against the demonstrations and at least 55 deaths have been reported. Police carried out raids overnight on Saturday in the largest city, Yangon, ahead of further protests in defiance of the military. Video footage showed security forces repeatedly firing at buildings as they moved into one street to make arrests. Hours later, thousands of demonstrators had gathered again in Yangon and the city of Mandalay. It followed demonstrations across the country on Saturday, with police in Yangon using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse crowds, reports said. There were no reports of fresh casualties. What about the police officers seeking refuge? Deputy Commissioner Maria CT Zuali, a senior official in Champhai district in the Indian state of Mizoram, told Reuters news agency that she had received a letter from her counterpart in Myanmar's Falam district requesting the return of the police officers. The letter said that Myanmar had information about eight police officers who had crossed into India. ""In order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries, you are kindly requested to detain eight Myanmar police personnel who had arrived to Indian territories and hand-over to Myanmar,"" the letter read. Ms Zuali said she was awaiting instructions from India's home affairs ministry in Delhi. According to Reuters, about 30 people including the officers and their family members have crossed the border into India seeking refuge in recent days. On Saturday, scores of other Myanmar nationals were waiting at the border hoping to flee the turmoil, AFP news agency reported, citing Indian officials. How did the unrest start? Myanmar's military seized power at the beginning of February after detaining the democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Days later, a civil disobedience movement began, with many people refusing to return to work and some taking part in huge street protests. Myanmar's security forces responded with a violent crackdown - firing live rounds at unarmed protesters. The military has not commented on the deaths. More than 1,700 people have been detained since the coup, according to UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, including members of parliament, protesters, and at least 29 journalists. Ms Bachelet said the figures could be much higher due to the large scale of the protests and difficulty in monitoring developments. Myanmar in profile",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chagos legal status sent to international court by UN,"The UN General Assembly voted by 94 countries to 15 that The Hague should examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands. The former British colony used to be part of Mauritius but was detached in 1965 and is now home to a US airbase. The Foreign Office said it would be an ""inappropriate"" use of the ICJ. ""This is a disappointing outcome,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory is clearly a matter for the UK and Mauritius to resolve ourselves. ""Taking this dispute to the International Court of Justice is an inappropriate use of the ICJ mechanism."" Mauritius, which gained independence from Britain in 1968, argues that the UK broke international law when it separated off the islands before granting Mauritius its independence. 'Embarrassing defeat' Diego Garcia, the largest of the group of islands, was leased to the US in 1966. Families were forced to leave the Chagos Islands in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a US Air Force base on Diego Garcia, which is leased until 2036. The Foreign Office said it did not recognise Mauritius's claim to sovereignty over the islands - but that it would return the islands when they were no longer needed for defence. ""We have committed to cede them to Mauritius when the territory is no longer required for defence purposes,"" the spokesman said. ""At present it plays an important role in regional and global security, helping to keep the UK, US and other allies, including Mauritius, safe."" The government said it would ""robustly defend"" its position ahead of the ICJ's decision, which would not be legally binding. Most EU countries abstained from the vote, which BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale described as an ""embarrassing diplomatic defeat"" for the UK. He said it signalled that Britain's diplomatic clout had waned after the vote for Brexit. In 2015, the UK Supreme Court denied a legal challenge by former islanders to return to Chagos after being removed more than 40 years ago. The court rejected claims that islanders suffered a ""significant injustice"" by being forcibly removed from their homeland.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Ysgol Coed Menai school, Bangor, closure plan is backed","Ysgol Coed Menai near Bangor - formerly called Ysgol Treborth - provides education for pupils who have social, emotional and behavioural problems. Gwynedd council said it had developed plans to support the pupils at local schools, and in a new smaller unit. But former head teacher Wil Parry Williams said earlier on Thursday that pupils' education would suffer. He argues that the school should go back to being residential because it would offer a better quality of life, which smaller day units could not match. ""I felt a mix of disappointment, heartache and sadness when I heard the place was to close and feel it has been left to run down,"" he told BBC Radio Cymru. Lack of use He said children with chronic needs needed residential care to develop properly because it provided them with a stable environment. ""The decision to close is the wrong one and may result in children who have serious behavioural problems having to be found places at private schools, which will prove expensive,"" he added. A Gwynedd council spokesman said the school stopped being a residential facility in 2003 because of a lack of use, and the plans to close the school came from a recently adopted ""county-wide inclusion strategy"" to improve the support available. ""The improvements which will be implemented will ensure better support for these pupils in their local school,"" he said. ""In addition, a new specialised unit will be established for September 2012 for the small number of pupils with severe behavioural and emotional problems."" The spokesman said there were 24 pupils who required ""such support"" at Ysgol Coed Menai, 10 of whom lived in Gwynedd. 'Poor condition' But he added: ""We anticipate that only four of these pupils will need educational support for complex emotional and behavioural difficulties from September 2012. ""The remaining 14 pupils come from Conwy and Anglesey, and the education departments of both councils have confirmed that they will not be sending pupils to Ysgol Coed Menai from September onwards."" Andrew Wilson, the head of additional learning needs services with Conwy Council, said the authority was aware of the plans for the school ""currently housed in a listed building in poor condition"". ""Consequently, we have been planning to make available a full range of alternative and appropriate provision to meet the needs of these young people within Conwy County. This provision will be in place by September 2012,"" he said. Anglesey council added it was ""currently considering various options in relation to alternative provision on the island"".

Covid: Moray moving to level two 'hugely welcome',"The area had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate. However it has dropped in recent days, to under 40 cases per 100,000 people - below the level two threshold of 50. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Moray would move to level two from midnight. Moray Council chief executive Roddy Burns paid tribute to efforts that have been made locally. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Moray had improved ""significantly"". Level two restrictions means pubs and restaurants are allowed to serve alcohol inside until 22:30, and limited numbers of people can socialise indoors. Social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens is no longer required and people can travel to and from areas in the same or a lower level. The vaccination roll-out was earlier widened to include younger adults in Moray. Mr Burns said: ""It's hugely welcome news that Moray will move to level two from midnight and I pay tribute to the community, NHS and council colleagues for their response to the increased and enhanced testing and accelerated vaccination programmes. ""Thanks also to our vibrant business community for their support and forbearance as we overcame this challenge together. ""The move means so much to so many."" He added: ""This outbreak in Moray has brought it home how easy it is for the virus to run out of control."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he was delighted his local area was moving to level two. 'Willingness of community' The Moray MP said: ""I was able to have my vaccine last Sunday because we opened it up here to anyone over 18 without appointments from the NHS and I know that's happened in Glasgow. We've got to look at what has worked here and in other areas of the country to get any spike in cases down."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the strategy had been protecting people by ""getting ahead of the virus"". She said there had been an increase in testing, and detailed case checks. She echoed praise of the ""willingness of the community"" to help. Elgin and Keith were said to have been been among particular hotspots, along with areas such as Lossiemouth and Aberlour. According to official statistics published on Thursday, the weekly case rate in Moray had fallen to 36.5 per 100,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Microsoft seeks to clean up Xbox game chat with AI,"It is introducing customisable filters that let gamers choose the vocabulary they see in messages from friends and rival players. The four levels of filtering range from child-friendly through to entirely unfiltered. Initially the filters cover just text but will eventually apply to voice chat as well. Trash talk In a blog, Microsoft said the filters would be trialled with Xbox testers in October and then rolled out to all users of its console later in the year. Players will be able to decide what level of filtering they want to apply to their interactions with friends or people they take on in games, it said. Once applied, filters will also apply to Xbox apps on Windows 10 and smartphones as well as the Xbox Game Bar. Microsoft has introduced four levels of filters - friendly, medium, mature and unfiltered. A warning saying ""potentially offensive hidden message"" will appear on filtered messages. The ""friendly"" setting will be applied by default to all child accounts on Xbox. It screens out all vocabulary that could be offensive. The ""medium"" setting will let some robust language through, explained Larry Hyrb, director of programming for Xbox Live, in a video. ""Once you have applied the medium filter you'll notice that you'll still be able to see things like friendly trash talk between friends but vulgar words that we know are intended to bully or discriminate will be filtered out of your gaming experience,"" he said. Microsoft's ""mature"" rating covers text and messages that are almost always harmful to those who receive them, he added. Gamers can set different levels of filtering for friends and non-friends. The filtering system should be seen as an adjunct to Microsoft's existing community standards that encourage good behaviour while gaming, it said, adding that players should still report people who exhibited bad behaviour. Speaking to tech news site The Verge, Rob Smith, a program manager on Xbox Live's engineering team, said it was looking at developing systems that measure ""toxicity"" in online chat that can automatically mute people who are abusing friends and foes. This system could feed into the Xbox player reputation system where a bad rating can get players banned. Microsoft's work comes against a background of efforts by many other games firms to curb toxic behaviour - many of these systems have struggled to understand the context in which remarks are made and others have struggled with the slang used by certain groups. Studies have shown that the problem of abuse is widespread among gamers. An Anti-Defamation League study released in late July found that 74% of online players said they had experienced harassment of one form or another. More than half of the respondents to the ADL study said the abuse was based on ""race, religion, ability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or ethnicity"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Preparations 'on track' for Glasgow 2014 Games,"In its first progress report, the committee said venues were starting to take shape and key infrastructure was being put in place. The total cost of the Games is now expected to be about Â£523.6m. Earlier this year concerns were raised about funding cuts threatening the Games' legacy. The progress report said extensive work had already been put in place to develop and deliver a lasting social, economic and sporting legacy. Glasgow 2014 is being delivered in partnership with Commonwealth Games Scotland, the Scottish government and Glasgow City Council. March this year marked the half way point since it was announced that the city had won the right to host the 2014 Games. The report said almost Â£30m had been spent to date on planning and preparations. It forecast that a further Â£40m would be spent in 2011/12. It also said the organising team, established in 2008, now included 50 people and was moving from its current base in George Square to newly refurbished premises in Albion Street in Merchant City. The report said progress was ""well under way and on schedule."" ""Policies, strategies and budgets have been established along with all the relevant milestones which will ensure that Glasgow is ready to host the Games on time and on budget,"" it said. The report highlighted how work on venues such as the National Indoor Sports Arena and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome complex was progressing. It said work was also under way to build the first phase of the Commonwealth Village in the city's east end, which will provide accommodation and facilities for 6,500 competitors. It also outlined how the completion of key infrastructure projects like the M74 extension and the Airdrie to Bathgate rail ink would benefit the Games. The report said the Games partners were already working to create a ""lasting legacy."" It highlighted the opening of the Toryglen Regional Football Centre and the redevelopment of Scotstoun stadium as examples of this work. It also said that more than a third of the Commonwealth Games related contracts and sub-contracts awarded up until December 2010 had been won by Glasgow companies.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Merged Isle of Wight prison criticised in report,"An inspection of HMP Isle of Wight found ""degrading"" sanitation provision, high use of force and inmates seeking sanctuary in a segregation unit. Inspectors found a quarter of prisoners were locked in their cells during the day in one section of the jail. The prison was formed from the ""clustering"" of three jails in 2009. The report showed some progress had been made since the merger of Parkhurst, Albany and Camp Hill prisons but the amalgamation had created a massive institution with a number of problems. Night sanitation was said to be ""unacceptable"", staff resorted to ""inappropriate"" use of special accommodation, drug use was widespread and there was not enough education, training or work to keep prisoners purposefully occupied. Inspectors who visited the jail last October found too many inmates were unemployed and not enough focus was placed on vocational qualifications. Governor resigned The report also said safety had deteriorated at Camp Hill - though it had improved at the other two sites, where steps had also been taken to reduce the disproportionate use of segregation. Other areas praised included mental health services and suicide and self-harm prevention, which was said to be ""generally well-managed"". The report also noted efforts by management to develop staff-prisoner relationships. When the three prisons were combined into one category B jail, holding about 1,700 inmates, it was said the move would save more than Â£1m a year. But the merger has been criticised in previous reports and the governor, Barry Greenberry, recently resigned. Nick Hardwick, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said the prison was ""in many ways, the sum of its three disparate parts"" and acknowledged progress had been ""inconsistent"". Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the findings were ""worrying"" and reflected the ""true cost of unchecked prison expansion"". She said: ""Merging three separate prisons into one massive establishment has created a prison that, despite some improvements, is difficult to manage, unsafe in parts, with poor conditions in others and a lack of proper provision for education, training and work overall. ""These are lessons the government will need to consider carefully as it reviews its plans for the prison estate"". 'Right direction' But Michael Spurr, chief executive officer of the National Offender Management Service welcomed the improvements made following ""a radical programme of change"". He said: ""This report suggests the prison is heading in the right direction. ""The acting governor and his staff will continue to address the recommendations in the report and will build on the progress already being made."" In May last year, the prison had to replace its locks at a cost of Â£150,000 after a risk assessment showed there was a risk the locks could be ""compromised"". A report from the Independent Monitoring Board into Albany Prison, published in May 2009, questioned the merger, saying: ""The board feels the expense of the whole operation will not achieve the required financial result.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: MPs see surge in online petition numbers,"Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, who chairs the Petitions Committee, said they had highlighted issues that ""may have been overlooked"" by politicians. Popular petitions have raised issues such as sick pay for the self-employed, pay rises for NHS workers and tuition fee refunds for students. Ms McKinnell said the number of online submissions was ""unprecedented"". In a letter to other committee chairs, she said the issues raised had fed into letters MPs had written to ministers on their handling of the pandemic. However she added it is not possible to schedule debates on petitions in Parliament because the normal venue, Westminster Hall, is closed. Normally petitions are considered for a debate in Parliament if they gain 100,000 names. Those with 10,000 signatures also receive a government response. Parliament's Petitions Committee website reopened in early March after closing down because of the general election in December last year. In the weeks afterwards, the pandemic has worsened in the UK and the government has introduced social distancing and curbs to normal life to slow the spread of the virus. The economic impact has led to a surge in applications for welfare benefits, while so far 2.8m have been put on the government's furlough scheme. The most popular online petition, with 696,682 signatures, calls on the government to extend statutory sick pay to people who are self-employed. A breakdown by parliamentary constituency reveals it was most likely to be signed by voters in the south of England, notably London, Bristol and Brighton. The two next most popular petitions, launched on 6 and 12 March, called for ministers to consider closing schools and implement a ""lockdown"" - both measures which have since been imposed in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. A petition calling for students affected by university closures to have tuition fees reimbursed has garnered 330,859 signatures - perhaps unsurprisingly, it received much greater levels of support in cities and university towns compared to rural constituencies. Elsewhere 150,829 signed a petition calling for greater government support of the events industry, and 143,925 signed one asking for paid maternity leave to be extended for three months. Digital survey The maternity leave petition received the strongest level of support in south Wales and west-central Scotland, with lower levels of support in London and Birmingham. A digital survey sent by the committee to those who signed a coronavirus-related petition has so far received over 30,000 responses. In the last Parliament, 456 petitions received a response from the government and 74 petitions were debated in the House of Commons. Since the website launched in 2015, more than 23 million people have used the site.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stafford and Cannock hospitals' services 'unsustainable',"Recommendations that Stafford Hospital and Cannock Chase Hospital should be downgraded have been made in a report for regulator Monitor. Some services should be carried out by neighbouring trusts, the report said. They include maternity care as well as some Accident and Emergency (A&E) and paediatric treatment. The report said one-in-five patients could be sent elsewhere. The Contingency Planning Team (CPT) told Monitor staffing levels at the two hospitals were not sufficient to meet required standards in the long term given the current range of services and number of patients. The CPT has proposed two smaller hospitals are retained at Stafford and Cannock to provide some urgent care, speciality out-patient services and care beds for the elderly. A&E services are due to be downgraded, with the report suggesting half of emergency cases could be dealt with at other hospitals. Blue light transfers would also be affected by the proposals. 'Long-term quality services' It said other services could be provided at University Hospital of North Staffordshire, The Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust. Dr David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said the aim was to ensure local patients ""get good-quality services in the longer term"". Monitor has warned the Mid Staffordshire Trust faces being dissolved and said it would be up to special administrators, if appointed, to develop final proposals. Conservative MP for Cannock Chase, Aidan Burley, said it was important hospital services remained in the area. He said the Monitor recommendations were ""a major turnaround"" from the former Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust board's approach, which saw ""our local hospital poorly managed, under-utilised and virtually forgotten about"". ""However, I am aware that there remain a number of issues that need to be determined by the Trust Special Administrator, and I will be speaking with them as a matter of priority once they are in place,"" he added. The report was issued on the same day NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson faced a grilling from MPs over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David was head of the health authority that oversaw the hospital for 10 months between 2005 and 2006. He told the committee: ""During that period, across the NHS as a whole, patients were not the centre of the way the system operated.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fears raised 'free NHS' will come to an end,"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News Nearly half of the 78 health and care leaders surveyed by the Nuffield Trust felt the status quo would not remain because of the squeeze on funding. The think tank warned of a ""funding crisis this year or next"" and that patient care could start to suffer. The government called this an ""unrealistic picture"", but Labour said NHS finances were in a ""dire state"". Currently the health service gets just over Â£100bn a year. The Nuffield Trust said another Â£2bn a year may be needed to keep pace with demand. The review of spending since 2010 highlighted the growing number of NHS trusts falling into deficit as a sign of growing problems in the health service. Provisional figures for 2013-14 show 66 out of 249 trusts finished the year in the red. The overall deficit was about Â£100m, compared with a Â£383m surplus the year before. Report author Andy McKeon said the difficulties were likely first of all to lead to rising waiting times. ""The NHS has risen to the challenge of living within its means over the past three years,"" he said. ""But it has now reached a tipping point. The NHS is heading for a funding crisis this year or next."" 'Unrealistic picture' The warning comes after similar claims by the Health Select Committee and bodies such as the Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of GPs in the past fortnight. Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents NHS trusts, said: ""Staff have worked incredibly hard over the last four years to deliver unprecedented savings while public finances have been constrained, but the challenge is getting much more difficult."" Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""Everywhere you look, there are signs of an NHS now heading rapidly in the wrong direction. ""It is not just standards of patient care that are getting worse but NHS finances are in a dire state."" But Health Minister Lord Howe said: ""These predictions are pessimistic and paint an unrealistic picture of how our NHS is working."" He acknowledged unprecedented demands were being placed on some parts of the NHS, but pointed out that the budget had been protected during this Parliament.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Being a couch potato could be genetic say Aberdeen scientists,"Scientists from Aberdeen University, working with colleagues in China, have been looking at why some people are less inclined to exercise and more likely to put on weight. The team said they had found a mutation in a gene which may explain it. They said their findings raised hope of a personalised pill to reverse the problem being developed in the future. The study, by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB) in Beijing and the University of Aberdeen, has been published in the journal PLOS Genetics. Fat, lazy mice The scientists compared ""normal"" mice with mice that had a mutation in a gene called SLC35D3. The researchers discovered that SLC35D3 produces a protein which plays a key signalling role in the system in the brain which is involved in regulating physical activity levels - the dopamine system. They found that SLC35D3 seems to be important for transporting a type of dopamine receptor, from inside the cell where it is made to the cell surface. However, mice with this gene mutated had far fewer of this type of dopamine receptor on their brain cell surfaces. Instead, the dopamine receptors were stuck within the cell. This meant their signalling process was not functioning properly. However, treating the mice with a drug that activates dopamine receptors reversed the problem - the mice became more active and lost their excess weight. Prof Wei Li, from the IGDB, who led the study, said: ""We discovered that mice with this gene mutation were typical couch potatoes. ""They walked only about a third as much as a normal mouse, and when they did move they walked more slowly. ""The mice became fat and they also developed other symptoms similar to a condition in people called 'metabolic syndrome' - a medical term for those with a combination of risk factors related to diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity."" Tailored treatment He added: ""What was of particular interest, was that what that when we gave the mice a drug that acted on the dopamine signalling system, the genetic defect could be overcome and the mice became more active and thinner."" The researchers then screened 400 overweight and obese Chinese patients with metabolic syndrome and found mutations in the SLC35D3 gene in two of them. Prof John Speakman, who works between the University of Aberdeen and the IGDB, and was a co-author on the paper, added: ""Although only about one in about 200 people may have these 'rare' mutations, there are a very large number of people worldwide that have metabolic syndrome. ""Consequently the population of sufferers that may benefit from being treated with dopamine receptor drugs runs into many millions of patients."" Prof Li added: ""We are really excited about these findings. Medical treatments will in the future be tailored to fit a person's individual genetic make-up. """,Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poster wars breaking out across Europe,"By Piers ScholfieldBBC News, Brussels In Britain, the UK Independence Party has certainly got the publicity it was hoping for from its new poster campaign - and expects it to encourage a higher turnout from its passionately Eurosceptic followers. UKIP has been accused by some of scaremongering and racism. But some posters in Germany - where the visual campaign appears to be most energetic - are even more controversial. The far-right NPD has been reissuing posters which have caused scandal for years, with a very clear and openly xenophobic message. The caption ""Have a safe flight home"" accompanies an image of people of Middle Eastern appearance on a flying carpet. Another says ""resist!"" with an image of a boxing glove. This, critics say, is openly advocating violence. Others in Germany are more subtle and entertaining. The Pirate Party has put up an image of the Manneken Pis - the famous Belgian statue of a boy peeing - with the caption ""I can't do it when someone's watching"" - alluding to their campaign against the surveillance state. They are strongly in favour of freedom of movement across Europe - and put their point across with a powerful image of the Berlin Wall's razor wire - ""Borders are so 80s"". As for the main centre-right Christian Democrats, they have simply added a line on Europe to their recent general election campaign posters, with the spotlight firmly still on their star Angela Merkel - despite the fact she's not running for Europe-wide office. As for the rest of Europe, Germany features again and again, though the message from both right and left tends to be negative. Forza Italia - party of the disgraced, but still popular, Silvio Berlusconi - is keen to blame Germany for the recession. Their poster translates as: ""More Italy, Less Germany. Austerity imposed by Germany brought us to recession. We have to change!"" And in Greece, the insurgent party of the left, Syriza, also features Angela Merkel (below left) - alongside Greek PM Antonis Samaras - with the text: ""Our patience has run out - 25 May we vote and they go!"" Many countries' campaigns have yet to begin in earnest. But whatever the message, European institutions and politicians alike are trying to encourage people to go out and vote. The winner of a contest put on by the EU and the German government came up with an image (below right) which appears to acknowledge that the EU has flaws - but saying voters should be picky about which party they choose.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Viagogo threatened with fresh court action,"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took Viagogo to court last year for breaking consumer protection law. The ticket seller was given a deadline of 17 January to comply with a series of changes, but the CMA said it still had ""serious concerns"" about the site. Geneva-based Viagogo told the BBC: ""We are compliant"". Court order The CMA launched legal proceedings against ticketing websites last August over concerns that they were breaking consumer protection law. As a result Viagogo - along with rival second-hand ticket sellers StubHub and Ticketmaster - were ordered in November to change the way they run their websites. The court made a legally binding order instructing the websites to comply with the law by: 'Severe penalties' As of midnight on 17 January, the websites were required to have overhauled their processes to improve information about tickets listed for resale. The CMA said that following the deadline, it would do ""a comprehensive review of the changes each website has made"". Following its initial checks, the CMA said that it had ""serious concerns that Viagogo has not complied with important aspects of the court order we secured against them"". ""We have told Viagogo we expect them to make the necessary changes without delay. If they do not, we will go back to court to force them to do so."" It added: ""Severe penalties are available if they are found to be in contempt of court."" Last year, the Digital Minister, Margot James, told the BBC that if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". She was speaking after the Advertising Standards Authority referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards to investigate. The ASA had accused Viagogo of breaking UK advertising rules by failing to make additional fees clear. Consumer group Which? said: ""If Viagogo doesn't immediately change its practices and comply with this order the company and its bosses must be held accountable in the courts."" Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, added: ""We've repeatedly exposed Viagogo as a rogue operator and it is extremely concerning to hear suggestions that they may be flouting this court order in the same way they have flouted consumer law in the past.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action,"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter Andrew Bailey took over from current Bank governor Mark Carney on Monday. Mr Bailey was speaking hours after the US central bank slashed interest rates and the Bank of England alongside other central banks acted to ensure the financial system had enough US dollars. Mr Bailey said the coordinated action on US dollars was ""a step forward"". ""You saw some pretty big dislocations in financial markets last week, in particular in dollar financial markets which of course are global by nature. ""So the fact that the Fed, with the other central banks have extended swap lines so we can we can provide essentially three-month dollar money. Dollar money is a step forward. ""We're going to see how that how that works its way through the markets today in the coming days to see what the effect it has, but I would emphasise that this is strong coordination among central banks"". 'Very focused' Asked if the impact of the global pandemic on the economy would be more significant than the Bank's words last week that the effect would be ""large, sharp but temporary"", Mr Bailey, said the Bank was consulting epidemiologists [people who study disease outbreaks] to try to help work out the economic impact. ""There's two parts. First of all, of course, is how long Covid itself is going to go on for, obviously that's not something that as a central bank, we have an expertise in. We're working very closely with epidemiologists to understand that. That will obviously have an effect on the economy, no question about that. ""The second part - which we emphasised last week - which we are very keen also to ensure doesn't happen is that the economic effects that materialise during the period of Covid then get extended onwards by virtue of effectively the damage that's done to the economy and that's something that we want to want to minimise and stop. And that's why you saw prompt action last week."" The governor acknowledged that he was ""going to be very, very focused on on the response to Covid, that's the key thing at the moment. We need to get through that period"". But he also said that he had some important other objectives, from preparing the UK for its new relationship with the EU to dealing with new financial technology and to ""address our presence in the country as a whole, because that's one of the ways in which we serve the country as a whole"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NHS contaminated blood scandal victims urged to come forward,"Thousands of people were infected with HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood after blood transfusions and other treatments. After 30 years of repeated calls, Parliament will announce the terms of reference for the public inquiry. Welsh AM Julie Morgan said the campaign had been a ""long and hard road"". At least 2,400 people died in the UK after they were given blood products from overseas infected with hepatitis C and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. About 70 of those who died were Welsh and more than 200 are still living with the diseases. Prime Minister Theresa May told the BBC the scandal an ""appalling tragedy"" in September 2017. What is the contaminated blood scandal? A parliamentary report conducted in 2017 found around 7,500 patients across the UK were infected by imported blood products. Many were patients with an inherited bleeding disorder called haemophilia. They needed regular treatment with a clotting agent Factor VIII, which is made from donated blood. The UK imported supplies and some turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make Factor VIII came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. Julie Morgan, AM for Cardiff North, said: ""I have been involved with this campaign for nearly two decades after a constituent asked me to get involved when I was an MP. ""It has been a long and hard road to get to this stage - to finally get a judge-led public inquiry, after two previous inquiries didn't bring families closure over this awful scandal, is a major achievement. ""I'm glad the terms and conditions have now been agreed so we can now move forward to seek truth and justice for the very many Welsh families who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by this."" Lynne Kelly, chairwoman of Haemophilia Wales, said: ""Monday's announcement will be a pivotal moment for these families, who have seen their lives torn apart for more than 30 years through no fault of their own. ""We welcome the work that is about to be done to investigate the contaminated blood scandal and we urge all victims to come forward and help us move forward on our mission to get to the truth.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Julia Gillard grilled on Rudd ousting 'victory speech',"Ms Gillard, who took office in June 2010, had said she took the decision to challenge Mr Rudd on the day itself. But an ABC news programme suggested that preparations were under way well before this. The controversy comes amid speculation over the ruling Labor Party leadership. Talk has been rife in political circles recently over the possibility of Mr Rudd, the current foreign minister, making a return to the PM's office. He has said he is ""content"" being foreign minister. Ms Gillard is also suffering in the opinion polls. On Tuesday morning, Newspoll results published in The Australian newspaper showed that she had lost ground to opposition leader Tony Abbott. While support for him rose three points to 40%, hers dropped to 37%. 'Tense few days' Ms Gillard was being interviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners programme in an episode on Monday night entitled 'The Comeback Kid?'. Mr Rudd declined to be interviewed for the programme. Ms Gillard refused to say for certain if she knew the speech was being prepared in advance, but stressed that she did not commission it. ""This was a tense few days for me and the government so I can't specifically say to you when I came to know about the speech,"" she added on Tuesday morning. ""It could've been on the Wednesday night, it could've been before."" She emphasised that she decided to challenge Mr Rudd for a ballot for the Labor Party leadership ''on the day (she) walked into his office''. Other allegations that surfaced on the programme include suggestions that US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had quizzed Australia's ambassador Kim Beazley on the potential leadership change a fortnight before it happened. On Tuesday morning, members of the Labor Party questioned Ms Gillard's decision to take part in the programme, adding to the brewing tension over leadership issues. She later said she agreed to the interview request to address questions on ''the outlooks of the government''. ""My job is to answer questions and to explain what the government's doing,"" she told ABC on Tuesday morning. ""I'm not someone who runs away from questions, and so I did agree to the Four Corners interview.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mystery of the botched kidnap of a millionaire hotelier on the French Riviera,"By Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Jacqueline Veyrac, millionaire proprietor of the Grand Hotel in Cannes, was seized last Monday on a street in central Nice. Two days later she was freed after being spotted by a passerby on a road in hills above the city. She was bound and gagged and lying on the floor of a parked van. The passerby had been drawn to the vehicle because one of its registration plates was hanging off - revealing a second plate underneath. On Sunday, the state prosecutor in Nice praised Mme Veyrac's courage throughout her two-day ordeal, all of it spent on the floor of the van. ""She never gave up. She showed exceptional character,"" said Jean-Michel Pretre. Twice the 76 year old managed to wriggle out of the plastic cords binding her hands and ankles, but each time her captors spotted her. Throughout her captivity she refused to eat the food she was offered, and took only water. Unusual cast According to the prosecutor, six people have been arrested and placed under investigation for kidnap and extortion. A seventh man - a former policeman - faces the lesser charge of not reporting a crime. Five of the seven remain in custody. The main suspect is Giuseppe Serena, a 63-year-old businessman and restaurateur from Italy, who used to run the famous La Reserve restaurant on a promontory above Nice harbour. La Reserve is a Nice landmark - and also belongs to the Veyrac family. According to the prosecutor, Mr Serena bore a grudge against Mme Veyrac, who he blamed for the collapse of his venture at La Reserve. In 2007, he had signed a contract to run the restaurant in partnership with Finnish chef Jouni Tormanen. The two had previously controlled the Michelin-starred L'Atelier du Gout in Nice. But by 2009 La Reserve was crippled with debt. They scaled back the operation, but too late, and their company was eventually declared bankrupt. Today La Reserve is under a new team. According to the prosecutor, Mr Serena was planning to issue a ransom demand to the Veyrac family in order to recover the large sum of money he says he lost in La Reserve. To plan the kidnap, he allegedly recruited an unusual cast of characters. They included a man named by the prosecutor as Luc G, nicknamed ""Tintin"", a former paparazzo turned private detective whose task - according to the prosecutor - was to place GPS tracer beacons on Mme Veyrac's car. Another alleged recruit was a Briton living rough on the Promenade des Anglais - the Nice seaside drive that was the scene of last July's deadly lorry attack. This man allegedly claimed to have served with UK special forces and was given the job of tracking Mme Veyrac's movements. The others indicted are said to have carried out the kidnap. Police are trying to see if there is a link with a previous failed kidnap attempt on Mme Veyrac in 2013.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Search under way for monkeys missing from Belfast zoo,"Six lion-tailed macaques managed to get out on Monday - four have since been returned. The other two monkeys have been seen in the grounds or near the zoo. Belfast zoo said it has been monitoring their movements and has positioned a number of traps and staff in the areas where the missing animals have been seen. One of the monkeys was captured by zoo keepers in the grounds of Belfast Castle. The incident was filmed by Michael McGowan, who was walking his dog in the castle grounds at the time. Mr McGowan told the BBC he spotted the monkey shortly before it leapt on to a window ledge on the castle. ""The dog took a second glance, I took a second glance, and the monkey wasn't in the least bit worried about human beings being about,"" he added. He said zoo keepers arrived with a dart gun to sedate the animal, but it tried to escape before they could fire a shot, so one keeper ""rugby tackled"" the monkey to the ground. Another one of the monkeys made a surprise appearance on a ""peace wall"" fence at a primary school in Newtownabbey on Thursday morning. The animal perched on the fence at Hazelwood Integrated school, on the Whitewell Road, during the school run. Tricia Douglas, a teacher in the school's nursery department, took a photograph of the unusual visitor who appeared shortly after she arrived for work. Ms Douglas said a classroom assistant had noticed the monkey at about 08:30 BST and the school authorities then alerted the zoo. She said the schoolchildren were excited by the sight of the monkey and offered him some bananas, which he came down off the fence to collect and eat. However, she added that the animal ran off before zookeepers arrived to catch it. Belfast zoo manager, Mark Challis, said: ""We are confident that all of the macaques will soon be found and returned to their enclosure."" ""If anyone sees the lion-tailed macaques we would ask them to contact the zoo immediately. ""Although they pose no danger to the public, we would ask that you do not attempt to approach or catch the animal. ""The zoo team can be contacted on 028 9077 6277.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: UK foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn amid economic downturn,"It said a review of aid projects has prioritised the most vulnerable countries for assistance. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would still meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on international development. But MPs criticised the announcement's timing as Parliament breaks for summer. Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the Commons International Development Committee, said it was ""poor practice"" to announce the move on the final day of Parliament before the summer, preventing MPs from asking questions about it. In a letter to Ms Champion, Mr Raab said the UK was ""experiencing a severe economic downturn as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic"". Despite the reductions, Mr Raab said money spent this year ""remains prioritised on poverty reduction"". He added that aid would also focus on ""tackling climate change and reversing biodiversity loss, championing girls' education, UK leadership in the global response to Covid-19, and campaigning on issues such as media freedom and freedom of religious belief"". Spending on Official Development Assistance (ODA) was set to be Â£15.8bn this year, before the Covid-19 crisis emerged. Mr Raab said spending on ODA would remain at 0.7% of GNI. The foreign secretary suggested the cuts were in anticipation of ""potential shrinkage"" in the UK economy in the coming months. He said a Â£2.9bn package of reductions in the government's planned foreign aid spending had been identified ""so we can proceed prudently for the remainder of 2020"". ""The package I have agreed with the prime minister maintains our flexibility and enables the government to manage our ODA spend against an uncertain 0.7% position,"" he added. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the Department for International Development (DFID) would be merged with Mr Raab's department. The PM said at the time that UK aid spending had ""been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests"". 'No consultation' Ms Champion said Mr Raab's announcement on the last day of Parliament before the long summer recess raises more questions than it answers"" and queried the timescale of the cuts. ""If it is with immediate effect, do the projects know or will they find out via the media as DFID staff did about the merger? Is there an overarching strategy in place?"" she wrote. She added: ""Clearly there has been no consultation, but to release this news literally as Parliament rises so there can be no scrutiny by MPs is poor practice."" Liberal Democrat international development spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said assurances over foreign aid were not ""worth the paper they were written on"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rooney mania grips Tanzania as Everton play Gor Mahia,"By Stanley Kwenda BBC Africa, Dar es Salaam Rooney had the first touch of the game between Everton and Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia and scored after 35 minutes, lifting a clever effort over the home goalkeeper from 25 yards. The goal was even cheered by fans of the opposing team, with one dressed in a Manchester United shirt forcing the game to be stopped after invading the pitch to give Rooney a hug. The former England captain responded by returning the favour before the fan was bundled off the pitch. Everton ultimately won the match 2-1, with Kieran Dowell scoring a later winner after Jacques Tuyisenge levelled for the hosts. Many fans - some of whom travelled from the neighbouring East African nations of Kenya and Uganda - chanted ""Rooney, Rooney"" as the players left the stadium at the end of their two-day stint in Tanzania. Rooney was replaced at half-time and several Gor Mahia players stopped him to pose for photographs after the final whistle before he was escorted away. Everton winger Aaron Lennon also made his first appearance since February 11 after receiving treatment for a stress-related illness. Gor Mahia earned the right to play Everton after winning the regional SportPesa Super Cup, which pitted teams from Tanzania against those from Kenya. Kenyan betting firm SportPesa sponsors both Kenya's and Tanzania's top-flight leagues and were confirmed as Everton's new shirt sponsor in May. 'Royal treatment' Everton have been given royal treatment since they arrived in the East African state. The wild chants for Rooney, along with stomping performances by Maasai cultural dancers, created a spectacle to behold. Everton's Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yannick Bolasie rivalled Rooney, England's former captain, in the popularity stakes with a band of Congolese fans welcoming him to Tanzania. They were draped in T-shirts emblazoned with his face. However, Rooney, who has rejoined Everton after 13 years at Manchester United, was the fans' favourite. Even Tanzania's Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan attested to this. ""Wayne Rooney made me support Manchester United and now I don't know what to do because he has gone back to Everton,"" she said. Rooney replied: ""Being here, it has been a new experience for me and I hope the vice-president will now be able to support Everton."" Offering their support On Wednesday, Everton's Mo Besic, Tom Davies and newly-signed Michael Keane joined Albino United in a training session in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam, soon after they landed. The visit was aimed at helping to break the stigma against people with albinism who risk being killed in Tanzania. ""From spending time with them today, I have learnt that the players go through some tough times. It's not easy for them over here,"" said Keane, who made his debut in the second half. ""It's good that they can enjoy football and look forward to playing together. You can see their coach is really good with them.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ants use Sun and memories to navigate,"By Helen BriggsBBC News Scientists say they can follow a compass route, regardless of the direction in which they are facing. It is the equivalent of trying to find your way home while walking backwards or even spinning round and round. Experiments suggest ants keep to the right path by plotting the Sun's position in the sky which they combine with visual information about their surroundings. ""Our main finding is that ants can decouple their direction of travel from their body orientation,"" said Dr Antoine Wystrach of the University of Edinburgh and CNRS in Paris. ""They can maintain a direction of travel, let's say north, independently of their current body orientation."" Ants stand out in the insect world because of their navigational ability. Living in large colonies, they need to forage for food and carry it back to their nest. This often requires dragging food long distances backwards. Scientists say that despite its small size, the brain of ants is remarkably sophisticated. ""They construct a more sophisticated representation of direction than we envisaged and they can incorporate or integrate information from different modalities into that representation,"" Dr Wystrach added. ""It is the transfer of information aspect which implies synergy between different brain areas."" UK and French researchers came up with their findings by studying desert ants. Experiments suggest the ants kept to the right path by following celestial cues. They set off in the wrong direction if a mirror was used to obscure the Sun. If they were travelling backwards, dragging food back to their nest, they combined this information with visual cues. They stopped, dropped the food and took a quick peek at their route. Scientists say the work could have applications in designing computer algorithms to guide robots. Prof Barbara Webb of the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics said the ant can navigate much like a self-driving car. ""Ants have a relatively tiny brain, less than the size of a pinhead,"" she said. ""Yet they can navigate successfully under many difficult conditions, including going backwards. ""Understanding their behaviour gives us new insights into brain function and has inspired us to build robot systems that mimic their functions."" She said they have been able to model the neural circuits in the ant's brain. The hope is to develop robots that can navigate in natural areas such as forests. The research is published in the journal Current Biology. Follow Helen on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lifespan gap 'widening between rich and poor',"By Judith BurnsBBC News Everyone is living longer but rich people's lives are extending faster, the City University London study says. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century but this trend reversed for men in the 1990s. Author Prof Les Mayhew from Cass Business School said the difference was mainly due to ""lifestyle choices"". Based on figures from the Human Mortality Database, researchers measured the differences in age between the youngest 10% of adult deaths and the oldest 5%. From 1870 to 1939 the gap steadily closed, the report said. ""Everyone benefited from improvements in clean drinking water, better housing, higher incomes and better health,"" said Prof Mayhew. After 1950 there were further rises in life expectancy - though inequalities in lifespan persisted rather than narrowing further. But in the 1990s lifespan inequalities actually worsened, particularly for men, for the first time since the late 1870s, say the researchers. They found that for men who died in 2010 aged over 30: For women who died aged over 30 in 2010: Commenting on the data, Prof Mayhew said: ""This is partly due to some men now living to exceptionally old ages and in many cases equalling women - but at the other end of the distribution there has been a lack of progress."" Harmful choices The researchers attributed the widening disparity to poor lifestyle choices. ""Many of the big gains from public health improvements are in the past and personal choices are now much more important,"" the report says. ""Men in lower socio-economic groups are the most likely to make damaging lifestyle choices. ""They put themselves in harm's way on average more than women do - they smoke more, drink more and there are periods in their lives when they partake in riskier activities,"" say the authors. The authors suggest lack of wealth is not directly responsible for the difference, but the poorest groups are more likely to suffer the cumulative effects of decades of poor lifestyle choices and income inequality - while wealthier, more educated people may find it easier to adopt healthier habits. The authors say the negative health outcomes of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet and lack of exercise ""are disproportionately associated with the poorest in society"". They say it is vital to encourage healthier lifestyles and to counter pressure on individuals from ""exposure to advertising, their communities and peer groups"". 'Worrying' Baroness Sally Greengross, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre, said the figures were ""particularly worrying"". ""Preventing inequalities in ill health and disability must be a priority for policy action,"" she said. A Department of Health spokeswoman said everybody should have the opportunity to have a long and healthy life. ""The number of workless households is at a record low and we know that economic security can provide the foundation for better physical and mental health. ""We have shown that we are willing to take tough action to protect the public's health.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'fake' painting revealed,"Since February, Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th Century work Young Woman has been replaced by a $120 (Â£70) counterfeit, produced in China. The public was asked whether it could identify the fake amongst the permanent collection of 270 Old Master paintings. Nearly 3,000 visitors cast a vote, but only 10% guessed correctly. The original will be put back in its frame on Tuesday and hung beside the replica, allowing people to compare the stylistic and material differences between the two. Conceptual artist Doug Fishbone came up with the idea, selecting the original work and commissioning the copy from one of China's numerous exporters of handmade oil paintings. The painting was made by the Meishing Oil Painting Manufacture Company, where 150 artists, many of them art students, make copies of well-known paintings - including Picasso, Matisse, Van Gogh and Monet - to order for clients across the world. According to its website, the company ""can reproduce various kinds of famous oil paintings in the world in enormous quantities such as impressionist, modern painting, scenery, seascape, still life, animal, pop art, abstract, classical, group paintings, reproduction oil painting, commerce oil painting, custom portrait oil painting and so on"". Strictly speaking, the works are not fakes, since the studio is careful to change the size slightly from the originals. Attendance boost Dulwich Picture Gallery was the first purpose-built public art gallery in England when it opened its doors in the south London suburb in 1811. Chief curator Dr Xavier Bray said attendance had quadrupled during the last two months. ""Never before have I seen so many people actively looking at each painting,"" he said. ""Now Fragonard's portrait of a young woman has returned to the gallery walls and hangs alongside its modern companion. The visual exercise of comparing and contrasting will demonstrate how exciting it is to engage with an original work of art, but also marvel at the skill of a modern copyist working 5,000 miles away."" Speaking at the launch of the project, Fishbone said his experiment would raise questions about the nature and importance of an original work versus a replica. ""In the West, we see replicas as very problematic, as 'fakes' perhaps, whereas in China the notion of copying cultural artefacts is seen totally differently,"" he said. Having seen the project through, he called visitors' responses ""intriguing and eye-opening"". ""I'm no conspiracy theorist, but if it leaves viewers with a healthy suspicion that what is presented to them may not be what it seems, and that our experiences can be manipulated in ways we are unaware of or cannot detect, it will have done something quite interesting.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Eating disorders 'starting at a younger age',"By Anthony BaxterRevealed presenter Beat, an organisation which supports people with eating disorders, posted a question on their website asking people suffering from anorexia and bulimia at what age they started having problems with food. More than 150 people aged between 12 and 24 replied. Around 20% of those who responded said they were 11 or younger when they first had problems and the youngest was just six years old. Georgie, 12, became anorexic last summer. ""I remember playing tennis and one of my friends said, 'You've lost weight, you look really good' and I was thrilled,"" she said. ""I wanted more friends. I thought if I was thinner people would like me more."" Georgie admits at her worst, she wanted to kill herself. ""I self harmed and I felt suicidal,"" she said. ""My parents took all of the locks off the doors so I couldn't go in and attempt suicide. It just felt like the only option sometimes."" 'Lack of research' Beat says although the number of people it spoke to for the study was small, very little research has been done into how widespread eating disorders are among young people and at what age they start to develop problems. The exact number of people in the UK diagnosed with illnesses like anorexia and bulimia has never been calculated. The charity is now calling on the next government to find out this figure. Georgie's parents quickly realised something was seriously wrong and she was admitted to a specialist eating disorder clinic. She spent six weeks there, on an intense eating plan. Now better, she says it's difficult to accept that eating disorders aren't always taken seriously. See Georgie's story on the Revealed pages of BBC Switch ""One of my best friends was hospitalised and tube fed because she wasn't treated properly,"" she said. When she first became sick, Georgie didn't realise she had a mental illness. She said: ""I remember asking my mum how my sister felt about it, and she said, 'She's horrified that you want to kill yourself'. ""That wasn't how I thought about it. I felt stronger than people, because I had more self control. ""She was ignored slightly, which is ridiculous. She wasn't referred to a psychiatrist because anorexia isn't treated as a serious mental disorder, it's thought of as a lifestyle choice. ""I wasn't taken seriously because I wasn't underweight. I want people to know that anorexia is out there. ""We all need to do more to look out for it, so we can stop it before it's too late.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kronospan Chirk biomass plans vote deferred for site visit,"Kronospan says the plant would provide renewable energy for its wood panel factory at Chirk and help secure 600 jobs. But local councillors called on members of Monday's planning committee to visit the site before voting. There are concerns about the impact of the plans on tourist attractions. Wrexham mayor and Chirk north councillor Ian Roberts successfully argued that fellow committee councillors should see a similar biomass plant at Deeside's Shotton paper mill and visit the Kronospan site before deciding the fate of the plans. The committee had been recommended to approve proposals for the plant which would generate renewable electricity and heat for the existing factory by processing biomass from wood rejects and waste at the site. But concerns have been raised in nine representations made by neighbours, according to a report by the head of community and well-being at Wrexham council. They include worries over noise, odours, the visual impact, and its proximity to tourist attractions such as Chirk Castle. 'Economic benefits' Llangollen Canal World Heritage Site, which runs for 11 miles (17.7km) along the route of the canal, is 50m to the west of the factory, which lies within its ""buffer zone"". There are concerns the plans may set a precedent for similar developments. The Canal and Rivers Trust said the development would have a ""significant visual impact"" but would be viewed ""against the context of the existing industrial plant"". However, the council report said Welsh monuments body Cadw had not objected. ""Whilst they recognise that the new plant will undoubtedly contribute to a greater cumulative impact on the settings of several listed monuments and the World Heritage Site, the impact is not in Cadw's opinion significant when the scale of the existing Kronospan complex and its presence within the landscape is taken into account,"" said the report. Kronospan said its existing factory faced energy supply issues and the renewable energy generated would ""offset a significant proportion of the current energy requirements... currently derived from predominantly fossil fuel sources"". The company said the plant would also help secure the future of the site for its 600 employees and 2,500 people indirectly employed by its operations. The council report concludes there is ""significant environmental and economic benefits in allowing this development"" and recommends that the planning committee approves the plans.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Gamekeepers' knowledge benefits eagles, says SGA","The association acknowledged persecution was an issue and it had recently expelled four members for wildlife offences. But it said conservation work by many grouse managers was being ""overlooked"". It said a survey of keeper-managed moors in east and central Highlands had identified at least 55 eagle nests. On the west, where the SGA said there was little interest in grouse shooting, eagle numbers had been constrained by a lack of small prey, reduced deer populations and extensive forestry. Chairman Alex Hogg said gamekeepers had the know-how to aid golden eagle conservation work. He said: ""The conservation work done by many of our members in this area is forgotten because of the actions of a few."" Mr Hogg said steps have been taken to tackle persecution. He added: ""As well as educating, we have expelled members found to commit wrong-doing and where conflicts arise, as they will, we advocate lawful solutions. ""That said, many responsible game managers have had eagles on their land for many, many years now. They are willing to assist wider eagle conservation and have skills to be an asset."" 'Criminal practices' Earlier this week, the Scottish government announced a series of actions aimed at protecting birds of prey. Launching the initiative, Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse condemned the ""outdated, barbaric and criminal practices"" which he said had put wildlife at risk. Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland has ordered prosecutors in the wildlife and environmental crime unit to work with Police Scotland to make sure all investigative means possible are being used. Scottish Natural Heritage has been asked to examine if general licences for trapping and shooting wild birds could be restricted on land where there is good reason to believe crimes have taken place. And a special group will be established to review how wildlife crimes are treated within the legal system. It will examine whether the penalties imposed are tough enough to protect species such as the golden eagle, hen harriers and red kites. RSPB Scotland said it welcomed responsible game management. Director Stuart Housden added: ""However, as the SGA acknowledges and the Golden Eagle Conservation Framework - published in 2008 by Scottish Natural Heritage - shows, illegal killing remains a very significant threat to golden eagle populations in Scotland. ""Many of the biggest problems in recent years have occurred on areas managed by gamekeepers as driven grouse moors. ""The ongoing persecution of birds of prey remains a stain on the worldwide reputation of Scotland.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Iraqi security forces 'abuse female prisoners',"Many were held for months or even years without charge, the report found. Interrogators often questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than the crimes in which they themselves were implicated, it said. The government called the claims ""over-exaggerated"", but admitted a number of female detainees had been mistreated. ""We have some limited illegal behaviours which were practised by security forces against women prisoners,"" a spokesman for the human rights ministry said. ""Iraq is still working to put an end to prison abuse."" He added that those responsible would be held accountable. 'Second-class status' More than 4,500 women are currently being held in prisons across Iraq, according to the 105-page report, titled ""No One is Safe"" - The Abuse of Women in Iraq's Criminal Justice System. A vast majority of them are Sunni Muslims, but the abuses documented by HRW showed ""women of all sects and classes"" were affected. Many of those interviewed described being ""beaten, kicked, slapped, hung upside-down and beaten on their feet, given electric shocks, and raped or threatened with sexual assault by security forces during their interrogation"". Sexual violence was so commonplace that one employee at a women's prison facility was quoted as saying: ""We expect that they've been raped by police on the way to the prison."" Contrary to Iraqi law, most of the female detainees had no access to a lawyer before or during their interrogations, the study found. ""Iraqi security forces and officials act as if brutally abusing women will make the country safer,"" said Joe Stork, HRW's deputy Middle East and North Africa director. ""Both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system. But women suffer a double burden due to their second-class status in Iraqi society."" In late 2012, Sunnis took to the streets demanding that the Shia-led government release women who were being held without charge or because of acts of terrorism allegedly committed by their relatives. But HRW said Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had failed to carry out his promised reforms of the criminal justice system. Several judges who tried terrorism cases alleged that some investigative judges were still committing serious violations of suspects' due process rights because of their ""collusion with security officers and because of the considerable influence Maliki exerts over the judiciary"", the report said. Iraq has seen a surge in violence over the past year. Government data says more than 1,000 people died in January, which would be the highest monthly toll for almost six years. HRW warned that the security forces' heavy-handed tactics and alleged abuses in Sunni-dominated areas were ""undermining the government's military efforts"" to combat insurgents linked to al-Qaeda who have attempted to take control of the cities of Falluja and Ramadi.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The climber who bagged all 282 Munros in one winter,"By Linda SinclairBBC Scotland News Kevin Woods, from Glasgow, is believed to be only the third person to have achieved the feat in a winter season following in the footsteps of the late Martin Moran and Steve Perry, who both died last year in separate climbing accidents. The 28-year-old, who started the continuous trek on Ben More on Mull in December finished it in 97 days on Ben Lomond. He is no stranger to Scotland's Munros, mountains over 3,000ft, (914m) having finished his third round just one month before he started the epic winter challenge. Mr Woods said the majority of the trip was self-supported, using a van to travel between the mountain ranges. He walked an estimated 1,400 miles (2,300 km) - almost the equivalent of hiking from Edinburgh to Rome. He climbed approximately 460,000 feet (140,000 metres), which is similar to scaling the highest mountain in the world, Everest (8,848m), 15 times. The freelance filmmaker, slept in his van, but also camped, used bothies, hostels and stayed with friends. He said some of the scariest times were periods of ""relentless storms in the north-west Highlands in February"". ""Imagine the van being rocked by wind, pounded by hail showers, lightning going off all around - it makes any summit a distant prospect,"" he said. His challenge was almost aborted four days in after he went over on his ankle on Ben More, near Crianlarich, on Christmas Day, but ""it all turned out OK and was mostly drama-free"". Mr Woods gave regular progress updates on his Instagram account and was aware from afar of the coronavirus outbreak. He said he was grateful to have completed the first half of the challenge in ""quick time"" as the UK went into lockdown giving him ""time in hand to finish the Munros ahead of the virus"". When asked if he thought he was safer far from civilisation in the mountains, Kevin said on the contrary: ""There's not much difference between being in the hills and being at home - both are physically isolated."" Since returning home, he says, it feels like he has never been away but in future he plans to write a book and make a film about the trip.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Abellio Greater Anglia rail firm faces franchise challenge,"Abellio Greater Anglia currently runs the East Anglia franchise, but it is being re-let in October 2016. It includes services to Stansted Airport and to Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, Hertfordshire and Suffolk. Abellio, in a joint bid with Stagecoach, now faces competition from the other two shortlisted companies - FirstGroup and National Express. Last month, it was revealed that Abellio Greater Anglia had had more negative tweets from passengers in 2014 than any of the other commuter train operators. Abellio carries more than 350,000 passengers a day. Announcing the shortlist, rail minister Claire Perry said: ""We have ambitious plans for East Anglia's rail network, and the successful bidder will be central to making these plans a reality. Analysis by Andrew Sinclair, BBC East Political Correspondent The government wants to show that it is moving fast to act on its manifesto promise. The pledge to provide a better rail service for East Anglia was one of the party's key pledges for the East, continually emphasised by the prime minister and his ministers whenever they visited during the election campaign. It is thought to be one of the reasons why the Conservatives did so well on 7 May. Work to upgrade the track and signalling has already started but upgrading the rolling stock and making it feel like a 21st Century train service will be the job of the new franchise holder and the government has already made it clear that whoever wins will be expected to make immediate improvements. The reality is that upgrading any form of infrastructure takes time, that's why ministers want to get the ball rolling now. They know that when the next election comes they will be judged on whether they have really delivered on that very public pledge. ""We want to find a partner who will help us meet the increasing demand for transport in the region by providing faster, more reliable journeys and better connections across the region and beyond."" Stagecoach Group chief executive Martin Griffiths said: ""We are one of the country's leading rail companies and we know the railway is central to the economy in East Anglia. ""We believe our strong track record, combined with the insight of Abellio, can produce a powerful joint bid to deliver a better experience for customers, and support jobs and businesses in the region."" Peter Radford, of the Essex Rail Users Federation, said he welcomed the government announcement as a ""positive"" but added he would ""like to see the money on the table"". In April this year Abellio announced a Â£20m plan to refurbish trains serving the East of England and increase services between Stansted Airport and Cambridge. Abellio Greater Anglia pledged the improvements as part of its agreement with the government. The firm also agreed to complete upgrades to stations at Bishops Stortford, Cambridge and Chelmsford.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scrap dealer law aims to reduce metal theft,"All scrap dealers and motor salvage operators in England and Wales must now apply for a licence from their local authority and keep records on who they buy from. The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 is aimed at thefts which have blighted the rail and power industries and seen churches targeted. The act also extends a ban on cash payments to mobile collectors. Trade body the British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) has welcomed the changes. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) set up a working group on metal thefts after estimating the illegal trade was costing the UK economy Â£770 million a year - it says such thefts are now falling. Paul Crowther, deputy chief constable of British Transport Police and national lead on metal theft for ACPO, said: ""We've all heard the stories about the impact on communities, businesses and individuals, and these new regulations and powers really provide us with the tools to crack down on metal theft. ""The problem has always been that people who turn up at a scrap metal yard are virtually untraceable once they trade the metal."" Councils will assess whether each licence applicant is a ""suitable person"" - including examining criminal convictions - and will have more powers to carry out inspections. Dealers who have not registered by 1 December face prosecution with fines of up to Â£1,000, limits on trading hours and the possibility of being shut down. BMRA director general Ian Hetherington described the new act as ""a watershed moment for the industry. It's an opportunity to rid the industry of the Steptoe and Son stereotype once and for all."" The new rules require dealers to record the value of the metal purchased, as well as proof of the seller's identity and address, and keep the records for three years. Gary Cooper, director of operations and engineering at the Association of Train Operating Companies, described the changes as ""excellent progress in the fight against cable thieves, whose actions cause delays and disruption for thousands of our customers"". Traders can apply for a temporary licence before 15 October in order to continue working while councils process full applications.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Hospices call for fundraising to continue,"Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice in Dinnington, South Yorkshire, has started a #LetsPledge campaign to keep people motivated in challenging times. It comes after Sheffield Mayor Dan Jarvis called for support for Barnsley Hospice amid the coronavirus crisis. The hospice is urging people to raise money virtually with online events. More stories from around Yorkshire Many hospices have warned they are facing major gaps in fundraising, with Hospice UK estimating the sector has already lost more than Â£70m in revenue. The government announced earlier this month it would provide up to Â£200m in funding per quarter to help hospices carry on through the pandemic. But hospices are now concerned about the funds needed after that. Bluebell Wood is continuing with end-of-life care but has had to cancel all planned respite visits, instead offering vulnerable families support over the telephone. It is also offering music therapy sessions online to children with life-limiting conditions. Families, visitors and supporters are being asked not to visit the hospice, in line with government advice. Director of care Susan Wood said: ""We've had to cancel all of our planned respite care, so normally our families would come to us for a very much-needed break, and it's quite a lifeline for many families to come and have that respite time. ""We are no longer doing planned respite but we are continuing with all of our end of life care, emergency care, our emergency care, symptom management, any emergency social issues or anything like that."" She added: ""Our head of fundraising is pledging to learn juggling, so there are many different ways of looking at what we can do."" Mr Jarvis, who is the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said: ""I know that hospices are facing an incredibly difficult financial situation during the coronavirus crisis as fundraising events cannot be held. ""I welcome the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a financial support package is being made available for hospices, to enable the NHS to purchase additional support from hospices in these incredibly difficult and challenging times. ""Barnsley Hospice does outstanding work providing compassionate care for Barnsley residents and their families and I will continue to support in whatever way I can.""

Sixth forms in England given Â£91m cash injection,"By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter The cash injection of Â£91m includes Â£57.4m for sixth form colleges for building needs and Â£30m for school and college places for 16 to 19-year-olds. A further Â£3.9m maintenance grant will given direct to sixth form colleges. The announcement comes as MPs debate the government's decision to abolish the Education Maintenance Allowance and teenagers rally against the cut. Of the Â£91m, Â£57.4m will go to England's 94 sixth form colleges, specifically for building repairs. Â£30m will go to sixth form colleges, school sixth forms and academy sixth forms to help them to expand provision for an increased demand for places when the compulsory education leaving age in England rises to 18 in 2013. The rest of the cash will see sixth form colleges get - for the time time - a funding stream called the devolved formula capital, which schools already receive. The Department for Education says this will mean the average sixth form college will be Â£40,000 better off. Julian Gravatt, assistant chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: ""It's positive that they [the government] recognise the needs of building conditions in sixth form colleges."" But Mr Gravatt said there were some unresolved questions about how further education colleges, which are not included in this cash injection, will fund the extra demand for places over the next few years. 'Missed out' Schools Minister Lord Hill said sixth form colleges with building needs had missed out on previous capital programmes. ""Even where funding is tight, it is essential that buildings and equipment are properly maintained, to ensure that health and safety standards are met, and to prevent a backlog of decay building up which is very expensive to address. ""This government is committed to ensuring that all young people have the opportunity to continue in education and training after the age of 16. ""I therefore want to ensure that funding is available to meet the need for additional places where there are demographic pressures in schools, academies and sixth form colleges."" David Igoe, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Forum, said sixth form colleges would welcome this allocation of money. ""These allocations will enable them to undertake essential maintenance and refurbishment with some new building also possible. ""This will greatly enhance sixth form colleges' ability to sustain high quality education in these challenging times. ""Sixth form colleges have missed out on capital over the last two years and it is very encouraging to see the government redressing this unfairness.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wilson Jerman: Ex-White House butler dies with coronavirus,"It was Jackie Kennedy who noticed Wilson Roosevelt Jerman while he was working as a cleaner in the White House. The then First Lady had him promoted, and from then on he worked as a butler. ""She was instrumental in ensuring that that happened,"" his granddaughter, Jamila Garrett, told Fox 5. Decades later Mr Jerman was commemorated by another First Lady, appearing in a photo in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming. Paying tribute after his death, Mrs Obama said her family were ""lucky to have known him"". ""With his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a home for decades of First Families, including ours,"" she said in a statement to NBC News. ""His service to others - his willingness to go above and beyond for the country he loved and all those whose lives he touched - is a legacy worthy of his generous spirit."" He died with coronavirus last weekend. Mr Jerman's family members say he stood out not just to the Kennedys, who were in the White House during 1961-63, and the Obamas, who lived there from 2009 to 2017, but others he met in his roles. Mr Jerman's career began in 1957 during the Eisenhower administration. In his last position, he served as a maÃ®tre d' in the Obama White House. He left his position in 2012, and President Obama honoured him with a series of plaques, one that represented each of the presidents he had served, Mr Jerman's granddaughter Shanta Taylor Gay told CNN. He remains an important figure for those who study the history of African Americans and their role in political life. Like other African-American men of his generation, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time, said Ohio State University's Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House. She said he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did. He was working for Mr Obama, ""a dignified president who was also African American"", she said, adding: ""That must have felt like a victory.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
North Korean man caught by South after crossing border,"The man, in his 20s, was wearing a diving suit and a set of fins when he was stopped in the de-militarized zone (DMZ), South Korea said. He is thought to be seeking to defect from the North to the South. It is rare for people to defect via the DMZ although a similar incident occurred last November. The man was located at the eastern zone of the DMZ at 04:20 on Tuesday (19:20 GMT on Monday), near the coastal town of Goseong, South Korean officials said. He was tracked for three hours as he made his way through the heavily-militarised zone before being picked up by South Korean soldiers. It is not yet clear if he is a civilian or a member of the military. ""He is presumed to be a North Korean and we're conducting an investigation into details, including how he had come down and whether he wished to defect,"" the Joint Chief of Staffs said in a statement on Tuesday It added that it would be investigating the security breach. The man is thought to have avoided the lines of barbed wire fencing along the beach by crawling through a drainage tunnel, which was not properly protected. A former gymnast defected via the DMZ last November by jumping over the border fence. According to South Korean media, authorities had the young North Korean jump several times to verify his story of how he crossed the border. An investigation found that a loosened screw in border sensors allowed the defector to cross undetected. South Korea's border sensor system is supposed to alert guards if there is some impact on the fence. Following the investigation, South Korea's military announced it would check every sensor at the inter-Korean border. Since taking power in 2011, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to have have ordered the tightening of border controls between the two sides and with China, including by laying more landmines. But about 1,000 people defect from North Korea each year, fleeing a repressive state that has faced numerous accusations of human rights abuses. Most North Koreans escape by crossing over the border to China from where they risk being sent back to the North. Crossing via the DMZ is dangerous. If spotted and arrested by the North Korean military, those trying to cross would certainly be taken to a detention centre to be interrogated. They could be tried and sentenced to lengthy terms in labour camps. The border and its fortifications have been in place since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953. North and South Korea remain technically at war as the fighting did not end with a peace treaty.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Colombia offers reward after eight young partygoers killed,"Four gunmen burst into a party held at a house in Samaniego on Saturday and shot dead seven men and one woman. The victims were part of a group of about 20 revellers. The motive for the attack is not clear but there are a number of drug gangs active in the border area with Ecuador. What is known about the attack? Survivors of the attack told El Tiempo newspaper that some of them had received threats on Saturday warning them to stop the party they were attending on the outskirts of the town of Samaniego. The group said they had decided to organise the party after an annual music festival was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. They gathered at the empty house of the grandmother of one of the organisers to drink beer and listen to music, according to the father of one of the victims. Some received messages over WhatsApp telling them to stop and minutes later, four armed men burst onto the property on motorbikes and opened fire. Who are the victims? Most of those killed had either just graduated from high school or were at university. The only woman to be shot dead, Laura Michel Melo Riscos, was planning to study medicine. Ãscar AndrÃ©s Obando Betancourt was studying sport in the city of Cali. Carlos PatiÃ±o, the father of Bairon PatiÃ±o, another of the young men killed, said his son had been attending the party with his girlfriend, who survived the attack. ""She told us that she survived because she played dead when the shooting started. The others who managed to get away, about 20 of them, were either in the kitchen or were able to run away, but all of those in the courtyard were shot dead,"" Mr PatiÃ±o said. Mr PatiÃ±o dismissed rumours that the shooting may have been a settling of scores between rival criminal or drug gangs. ""Those youths were decent youngsters, sporty and hard-working,"" he said. He added that his son played in the local five-a-side football league. What's the background? Murder rates have fallen since the government signed a peace deal with Colombia's main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), in 2016. 2019 had among the lowest number of homicides since 1975, according to figures from Colombia's ministry of defence. But breakaway factions of the Farc remain active in rural areas of the country, where they engage in extortion and drug trafficking. The country's second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) is also still active as are a number of right-wing paramilitary groups originally founded to fight the left-wing rebels. Despite the fall in homicide number, human rights and land rights activists have been killed by their dozens. But armed attacks such as on those gathered in Samaniego are unusual and reawaken memories of darker times in Colombia when its armed groups would carry out mass killings, especially in rural areas where there was no or little presence of the security forces.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Orhan Pamuk on Man Booker International Prize shortlist,"Orhan Pamuk, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006, is nominated for his book A Strangeness in My Mind. Italian writer Elena Ferrante, which is not her real name, is nominated for The Story of the Lost Child. The winner of the prize will be announced on 16 May at a formal dinner at the V&A Museum. Each shortlisted author and translator will receive Â£1,000, while the Â£50,000 prize will be divided equally between the author and the translator of the winning entry. Yan Lianke, author of The Four Books, was previously a finalist in 2013, but the other five authors are nominated for the first time this year. The finalists also include two recipients of the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize - Pamuk and JosÃ© Eduardo Agualusa, who has been nominated for A General Theory of Oblivion. Rounding off the shortlist is The Vegetarian by Han Kang and A Whole Life by Robert Seethaler. The six shortlisted books were written in six different languages - with four countries appearing on the list for the first time. Settings across the shortlisted novels include Angola, Naples, Istanbul, South Korea, China and the mountains of Austria. Boyd Tonkin, chair of the prize's judging panel, said: ""Our selection shows that the finest books in translation extend the boundaries not just of our world - but of the art of fiction itself."" This is the first shortlist ever to have been announced for the Man Booker International Prize, which has joined forces with the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and as of this year will be awarded annually on the basis of a single book. Previously, the Man Booker International was awarded every second year to an author for their entire body of work, and was most recently won by Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai in 2015. 'Anonymous' author Ferrante's biography on the Man Booker website reads: ""Elena Ferrante was born in Naples. This is all we know about her... [she] has stayed resolutely out of public view."" The author has previously stated her belief that ""books, once they are written, have no need of their authors"". Her anonymity has not stopped her from gaining high profile fans such as Zadie Smith and Alice Sebold. Ferrante's debut novel Troubling Love was published in 1991, but it is her ""Neopolitan"" series of four books - The Story of The Lost Child being the final instalment - that has been her biggest success. Her work has been published in 39 countries, and she has sold almost two million copies worldwide.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Cardiff police given random vehicle check powers,"South Wales Police said it would increase the numbers of officers on duty to encourage people to adhere to the rules. The powers will be in place from 09:00 on Friday until 17:00 on Sunday. People breaching regulations could be fined and told to leave the city, the force said. Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown ended on 9 November, allowing pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers to reopen, with social-distancing measures in place. People living in Wales could also travel anywhere in the country from this date, but travel to and from England, which is still in lockdown until Wednesday, is banned. Supt Jason Rees said: ""The past few months have been difficult for us all, and with the rules having relaxed slightly, non-essential business reopening and Christmas just around the corner, it's understandable that people will want to get out and about and enjoy all our city has to offer. ""The vast majority are doing so with caution and within the confines of the existing regulations, but those not adhering to the rules are continuing to put others at increased risk. ""We are anticipating another busy weekend in our city centre, and while we will continue to adopt the policing style we have throughout the pandemic - working with the public to encourage voluntary compliance - we are committed to enforcing where blatant and flagrant breaches occur."" North Wales Police said it had no special operation in place for the coming weekend but had an ""ongoing dedicated operation, which targets unlawful travel movement amongst other types of Welsh Government regulation breaches such as unlawful gatherings"". What are the coronavirus rules? In the run up to Christmas many of us would be heading out for drinks and catch-ups with friends and preparing for parties. But under current coronavirus rules in Wales it is illegal to meet up with too many people, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Mass gatherings and house parties are banned, while only groups from four different households are allowed to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and other businesses are also allowed to reopen, but with last orders at 22:00 GMT, there have been fears people may start going to each other's homes to drink. There are no travel restrictions in Wales, as local lockdowns have ended - but people are being urged to consider whether they need to travel before setting off. While England remains in lockdown - until 2 December - it is against the law to travel across the border, unless you have a reasonable excuse, such as providing care or for study or work (if you cannot from home). What are the fines? Under the coronavirus fixed penalty notices system, people can be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which increases to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gaia Pope: Missing teenager murder suspects released,"Gaia, 19, from Langton Matravers, Dorset, disappeared from nearby Swanage, where she had been staying, on 7 November. Rosemary Dinch, 71, and her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, both from Swanage, know Gaia. Police made the arrests after searching two Swanage addresses on Monday. Dorset Police said ""extensive searches"" would continue in the hope she was still alive. Police said a search for Gaia with the coastguard, volunteers from Dorset Search and Rescue and Wessex 4x4, along with members of the local community, was carried out on Tuesday in the Swanage area. Det Supt Paul Kessler said: ""We still believe Gaia is somewhere in the Swanage area... I remain hopeful that we will find Gaia alive. ""If the public can help us - anyone who has had contact with her in the last seven days, please contact Dorset Police as you may have information that can help us locate her. ""However, we will continue to conduct every avenue of inquiry which is open."" Gaia was last seen by Ms Dinch, a family friend, at an address in Manor Gardens, Morrison Road, Swanage at about 16:00 GMT. Before she was arrested she told BBC News Gaia had ""pounded"" on her door then spent 20 minutes with her. ""She was very upset, she slid to the floor at one point, I gave her a cuddle and she responded to me - I have no idea where she is - she just seems to have disappeared,"" she said. A statement released by police on behalf of Gaia's family said the continuing search had given them ""great comfort in what everyone will understand is a deeply worrying and scary experience for all who love Gaia so deeply"". The family also appealed to social media users to focus on ""constructive and positive efforts to find Gaia and not to encourage uninformed speculation which can have a negative impact on the family and be a distraction"". In a direct message to Gaia, the statement read: ""We all love you forever. We miss you beyond words. We will find you darling girl. ""The thought of seeing the sunshine of your smile again soon keeps us all going and hoping."" Gaia was said to be wearing a red checked shirt with white buttons, grey and white woven leggings and white trainers. She has severe epilepsy and she went missing without her medication. On Saturday, Dorset Police released CCTV footage of what they believe was Gaia running past a house in Morrison Road at about 15:40. The force said Gaia's family were being supported by specially-trained officers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US nuclear fears block Intel China supercomputer update,"Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine. Separately, Intel has signed a $200m (Â£136m) deal with the US government to build a massive supercomputer at one of its national laboratories. The Tianhe-2 uses 80,000 Intel Xeon chips to generate a computational capacity of more than 33 petaflops. A petaflop is equal to about one quadrillion calculations per second. According to the Top 500, an organisation that monitors supercomputers, the Tianhe-2 has been the world's most powerful machine for the past 18 months. This year the Chinese machine was due to undergo a series of upgrades to boost its number-crunching abilities past 110 petaflops. The upgrades would depend largely on new Intel Xeon chips. The chipmaker informed US authorities of its involvement with the upgrade programme and was told to apply for an export licence. 'In compliance' In a notice published online the US Department of Commerce said it refused Intel's application to export the chips for Tianhe-2 and three other Chinese supercomputers because the machines were being used for ""nuclear explosive activities"". The relevant section of US export regulations reveals that this covers technologies used in the ""design, development or fabrication"" of nuclear weapons. The notice added that the four institutions where the supercomputers would be located were deemed to be ""acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States"". In a statement given to the IDG news wire, the chipmaker said: ""Intel complied with the notification and applied for the licence, which was denied. We are in compliance with the US law."" China is now believed to be accelerating its own home-grown chipmaking efforts to boost the power of the four supercomputers and complete the upgrade programme. Although Intel has been denied the chance to sell its Xeon chips to China, the company has signed a large deal to build the Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. When finished that machine is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
GP recruitment drive film 'tackles outdated stereotypes',"By Jane DreaperHealth correspondent, BBC News It has been launched by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), which claims at least 10,000 extra GPs will be needed by 2020. The three-minute film features doctors talking about how they find general practice exciting and varied. NHS England is launching a big initiative next week to boost GP numbers. The RCGP says it wants to tackle stereotypes of general practice as being less stimulating and exciting than other medical careers. The film will be shown at a series of regional roadshows around the UK next week, timed to coincide with the recruitment round when medical graduates decide their training specialty. Dr Maureen Baker, the chairwoman of the RCGP, said: ""Reality programmes and dramas set in hospitals are always fast-paced and thrilling. ""But programmes about being a GP are very few and far between, and mostly reinforce outdated stereotypes about GPs handing out cough medicine and referring the more difficult cases to consultants. ""This video - and the GPs who appear in it - show that nothing could be further from the truth. ""While it might be unusual for a medical royal college to make a promotional video, we hope it will make a tangible impact."" 'Best job in the world' The RCGP has been campaigning for more investment in general practice, and it believes the tide is now turning. BBC News understands that on Monday NHS England will launch a package of measures to help encourage recruitment and retention among GPs. This will include a new scheme to encourage family doctors who may be considering a career break or retirement to instead remain working part-time. The measures will be funded by money from the Â£1.2bn investment announced in the Autumn Statement for a four-year plan to improve GP infrastructure. Scottish health ministers have also recently pledged an extra Â£40m for general practice, while the Welsh Government has announced a Â£10m cash injection for primary care. Northern Ireland says it has no issues encouraging students to become GPs. Last year, around 20% of the 7,341 doctors who completed foundation training chose to work in general practice, with particular shortages in the East Midlands, the North West and North East of England and Yorkshire and Humber. The RCGP says that the number of unfilled GP posts went up from 2.1% in 2010 to 7.9% in 2013. Ministers in England have committed to train 5,000 more GPs by the end of the decade. Dr Baker added: ""I've been a GP for over 30 years and I still believe it is the best job in the world.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Libor trial: 'Ringmaster' was 'greedy', court hears","Former City trader Tom Hayes, 35, of Fleet in Hampshire, has been accused of acting in a ""thoroughly dishonest and manipulative manner"" in his alleged attempts to rig the Libor rates, the court heard. The former UBS and Citigroup trader denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over the period 2006-2010. Mr Hayes was charged in June 2013. Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth billions of pounds. Mukul Chawla QC, acting for the prosecution, said: ""This case is about the dishonest rigging of bank rates for profit. ""The motive was a simple one: it was greed,"" said Mr Chawla, who described Mr Hayes as ""the ringmaster at the very centre, telling others around him what to do and in a number of cases rewarding them for their dishonest assistance"". 'You are greedy' Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Mr Hayes told investigators: ""The point is, you are greedy, you want every little bit of money you can possibly get... that's how you are judged, that's your performance metric."" It was this greed that led to ""dishonesty on an enormous scale"", said Mr Chawla. The prosecution accused Mr Hayes of enlisting ""the help of a large number of people across a large number of different financial organisations to help him"", Mr Chawla added. ""He tried to rig, and in many cases succeeded in rigging, the rates at other banks,"" Mr Chawla said. He achieved this by approaching people at other banks directly or through brokers acting as middlemen, he said. Mr Chawla said Mr Hayes had ""admitted his guilt, setting out precisely what he had done with whom"" and offering to give evidence about a ""large number of other people"". The court was played a clip where Mr Hayes said he was part of a system in which influencing Libor was ""commonplace"", although he admitted he was a ""serial offender"". 'Dishonest activity' The court also heard that Mr Hayes had been diagnosed with mild Asperger's syndrome. It was also told there had ""undoubtedly been some manipulation of Libor at UBS before Mr Hayes's own dishonest activity"". After Mr Hayes felt that ""UBS were not paying him enough"", he joined Citi in 2009. He was sacked after his methods were formally reported to senior managers and he returned to the UK. Mr Hayes is accused of lying about the rates that his bank was borrowing money at, thus affecting the calculation of the Libor rate. The trial is set to last between 10 and 12 weeks. The way Libor is calculated has now been changed in the wake of the rate-rigging scandal.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Autism brain secrets revealed by scan,"Scans revealed children carrying the gene variant appeared to have more nerve cell ""connections"" within the frontal lobe. They had fewer connections between this and the rest of the brain, reported Science Translational Medicine journal. Brain research has just begun to reveal autism's roots, a UK expert said. One-third of the population carry the CNTNAP2 gene variant, so it does not guarantee that autism will develop, but just slightly increases the risk. Different pathways However, scientists at the University of California in Los Angeles believe it may influence the way the brain is ""wired"". They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look for communication between different brain regions, and to measure the strength of these connections. They scanned the brains of 32 children as they performed learning-related tasks - half had autism, and half did not. Regardless of their diagnosis, those carrying the CNTNAP2 variant had differences in the connections within the frontal lobe of the brain itself and between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain. Dr Ashley Scott-Van Zeeland, who led the research, said: ""The front of the brain appears to talk mostly to itself - it doesn't communicate as much with other parts of the brain and lacks long-range connections to the back of the brain."" The researchers also spotted differences in the ""wiring"" between the frontal lobe and the left and right sides of the brain. In children with the version of the gene not linked to autism risk, the pathways were linked more strongly to the left side of the brain. In those with the ""risk variant"", the pathways were different, linking the lobe strongly to both sides of the brain. This, said the researchers, could explain why the gene variant had been linked to children who are slow in starting to talk. Dr Scott-Van Zeeland said that if the gene variant did predict language problems, then it might be possible to design therapies which helped to ""rebalance"" the brain and encourage normal development. Professor Margaret Esiri, a neuroscientist from Oxford University, said that researchers had so far ""barely scratched the surface"" of understanding the interplay between genes and brain development. Her own research closely analyses a scarce supply of donated brains from both autistic and non-autistic adults and children to look for differences in structure and function. She said: ""If you understand these subtle differences, there may be ways of 'tweaking' them earlier in life, and bringing them back into a normal trajectory of development. Of course, this would be many years away."" Carol Povey, from the National Autistic Society, said the study was interesting because it began to link genes thought to be involved in autism to actual changes in brain function. She said: ""The causes of autism are as yet unknown, but we do know there are likely to be many factors involved, so we hope this will contribute to our understanding of this complex condition.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Domestic violence legal aid changes were 'invalid',"Rights of Women said victims were being unlawfully denied funding in civil court cases because of changes made by ex-Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling. A rule that proof of domestic violence must be less than 24 months old was ""invalid"", the Court of Appeal said. The Ministry of Justice said the ruling would be ""carefully considered"". Rights of Women argued that rules introduced in 2012 had prevented victims of domestic abuse from accessing legal aid - even when there was ""clear evidence"" or an ""ongoing risk"" of violence. Legal aid is money given to pay legal costs for people who cannot afford them. 'First hurdle' The legal argument focused on the requirement that evidence of domestic violence - such as documents from medical professionals or social services - must be less than 24 months old to be considered. During the one-day appeal hearing in January, lawyers for Rights of Women said data showed 40% of victims did not have the required forms of evidence. They said large numbers of victims were being turned away ""at the first hurdle"", meaning they had to pay for a solicitor - which often meant going into debt - represent themselves or give up on the courts. The Court of Appeal found that Mr Grayling, in his former role as lord chancellor, did have the power to set requirements about evidence for domestic violence cases. But it concluded that a government regulation was ""invalid insofar as it requires verifications of domestic violence to be given within a 24-month period before any application for legal aid"". It said the regulation was also invalid ""insofar as it does not cater for victims of domestic violence who have suffered from financial abuse"". Rights of Women says financial abuse - where an abuser steals or restricts access to money - is ""almost impossible for women to evidence"". 'Risk of death' Sarah Clarke, Rights of Women's solicitor at the Public Law Project, which brought the case, said: ""We are very happy that the Court of Appeal has allowed this appeal. ""Legal aid provides for representation in proceedings enabling domestic abuse survivors to escape from abusive relationships, protect their children and manage their finances. This judgement will help ensure that they can achieve access to justice."" Rights of Women director Emma Scott said research showed that more than half of women who lack the evidence to show they have suffered domestic violence take no legal action because they cannot get legal aid. ""This leaves them at risk of further violence, and even death,"" she said. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We are pleased the court confirmed the lord chancellor did have the power to set domestic violence evidence requirements. ""We will now carefully consider the two findings made about the period of time for which evidence applies and concerns about victims of financial abuse. ""We are determined to ensure victims of domestic violence can get legal aid whenever they need it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Vietnam War: French court to hear landmark Agent Orange case,"The case was brought by Tran To Nga, a 78-year-old French-Vietnamese woman who covered the conflict as a journalist. She accuses the chemical firms of causing harm to her and her children. It is the first time civilian victims of Agent Orange have had their cases heard in court. The highly toxic defoliant was sprayed by US forces to destroy jungles and uncover the enemy's hiding places from 1962 until 1971. It contained dioxin, which is one of the most toxic chemicals known to humans, and has been linked to increased rates of cancers and birth defects. Vietnam says several million people have been affected by Agent Orange, including 150,000 children born with severe birth defects. What does the lawsuit say? Ms Nga filed the lawsuit in 2014 against 14 firms that made or sold the toxic chemical. The case will be heard in a court near Paris on Monday, and the named companies include Monsanto and Dow Chemical. Ms Nga is seeking damages in recognition of the health problems herself, her children and many others have suffered as a result of the chemical's use. She is also seeking recognition of the damage Agent Orange caused to the environment. The substance destroyed plants, poisoned animals, and polluted Vietnam's soil and rivers. ""I'm not fighting for myself, but for my children and the millions of victims,"" Ms Nga said ahead of the court hearing. The former journalist has suffered a number of health problems, including cancer and diabetes. One of her daughters also died of a malformation of the heart. ""A recognition of Vietnamese civilian victims would constitute a legal precedent,"" one international law specialist, ValÃ©rie Cabanes, told the AFP news agency. The US compensates its veterans exposed to the defoliant, but does not compensate Vietnamese nationals. The named companies, meanwhile, insist it was the US military that designed and made Agent Orange and say they cannot be held responsible for how it was used during the conflict. But lawyers for Ms Nga are expected to argue that the firms misled the US government over how toxic the substance was. Ms Cabanes described the toxicity of Agent Orange as ""absolutely phenomenal"". More than 80 million litres of Agent Orange are estimated to have been sprayed by US forces over Vietnam. From the 1960s, doctors in the country began to see a sharp rise in birth defects, cancers and other illnesses linked to exposure to the chemical. The US ended the use of defoliant chemicals in the war in 1971, and withdrew from Vietnam in 1975. But, decades after the conflict ended, medical experts say thousands of children in Vietnam are still diagnosed with congenital malformations every year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Homelessness Reduction Bill to become law,"The Homelessness Reduction Bill also requires councils to provide advice and help to all affected, not just those protected under existing laws. The private member's bill, introduced by Conservative MP Bob Blackman, received government backing. The government will be providing Â£61m to councils to meet the costs incurred. Mr Blackman, who claimed on Twitter it was the most expensive private member's bill ever passed, said: ""I am immensely proud of everything that has been accomplished in this bill. ""It is profoundly wrong that homeless people who approach their council for help can be turned away to sleep on the street at the moment and that legislation in this area hasn't changed for the last four decades."" Government backing The Homelessness Reduction Bill will oblige councils to start assessing someone at risk of being made homeless 56 days before losing their home. Currently, the threat of homelessness is defined as starting 28 days before the person loses their home. The government took the decision to back the private member's bill last year, with Communities Secretary Sajid Javid saying ministers were ""determined to do all we can to help those who lose their homes and provide them with the support they need to get their lives back on track"". The bill comes as the number of people sleeping on the streets increased by 16% last year, up from 3,569 in 2015 to 4,134 in 2016. 'Bill will struggle' However, local government representatives feel that without additional funding and support for councils, the additional legal protections introduced by the bill will mean little in practice. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""It is clear that legislative change alone will not resolve homelessness. It is crucial that the government recognise and address the wider factors that are increasing homelessness, such as the lack of affordable housing and welfare reforms. Without this, the bill will struggle to achieve its aim of reducing homelessness. ""Councils need powers and funding to address the widening gap between incomes and rents, resume their historic role as a major builder of new affordable homes and join up all local services - such as health, justice and skills. This is the only way to deliver our collective ambition to end homelessness."" The bill passed in the Lords unopposed.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Gentoo penguins are four species, not one","By Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent According to new evidence, the birds are slightly different in shape and size, and can be told apart by their DNA. Counting them as separate species will help in conservation, they argue, making it easier to monitor declines. The change would raise the tally of penguin species from 18 to 21. Dr Jane Younger of the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath told BBC News: ""Superficially, these species look very similar to each other; it's very hard to tell them apart just with your eyes. ""But if we sequence their genomes we can see very clearly that they are different. We also can tell based on different measurements."" Penguins face a number of threats in the wild, including plastic pollution, over-fishing and climate change. When it comes to climate change, gentoos are faring relatively well compared with other penguin species, but scientists say some populations have not been monitored for decades. Numbers are increasing on the Antarctic Peninsula but have fallen on some surrounding islands. ""Currently gentoo penguins are fairly stable in numbers, however there is some evidence of the northern populations moving further south as the climate gets warmer, so we need to watch them closely,"" said Dr Younger. Over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, gentoo penguins have become isolated from each other to the point where they don't interbreed, even though they could easily swim the distance that separates them. They should thus be considered four species living in different latitudes in the southern hemisphere, on the Antarctic continent, and further north, where conditions are milder, the scientists argue. The study, published in the journal, Ecology and Evolution, looked at the genetic make-up of gentoos living in the Falkland Islands and South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic and Kerguelen Islands in the Indian Ocean. The data was combined with measurements of museum specimens from each of the four populations. Gentoo penguins, which go by the Latin name Pygoscelis papua, are currently split into two subspecies. Any changes to the classification will need to be reviewed by an international committee of scientists before being formally accepted. Follow Helen on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Microsoft reports better-than-expected earnings,"The firm reported a net income of $6.56bn (Â£3.94bn) for the quarter, up from $6.38bn a year earlier. Its earnings were boosted by strong sales of its new Xbox game console and its Surface tablets during the holiday season. The company also saw strong demand from businesses for its cloud services. Overall, the firm's revenue rose 14% during the quarter to $24.5bn. Its shares rose close to 4% on the news in after-hours trading. Microsoft's chief executive, Steve Ballmer, called it a great quarter and said that investments the firm was making in devices and services was driving the strong results. The quarterly results showed a 13% increase in consumer sales. This was boosted by 7.4 million unit sales of Xbox consoles, up from 5.9 million a year earlier. The new Xbox One, which was launched in November, contributed more than half of overall Xbox sales numbers in the quarter. Sales of the firm's cloud programs, such as Office 365 and Azure, more than doubled in the December quarter from a year earlier, while sales of its Surface tablets doubled from the previous quarter. Leaving note Mr Ballmer announced in August last year that he would retire within 12 months, but as the company reported its latest results, it did not say anything about his replacement. He has been with the Microsoft for 33 years and succeeded founder Bill Gates as chief executive in 2000, but there have been concerns over what state he would leave the firm in. Windows software is still used on the majority of personal computers, but investors have criticised the company for not reacting quickly enough to the way Apple and Google have led the way in the fast-growing tablet and smartphone sectors. The software giant announced a transformation plan last year which Mr Ballmer said would address these issues. Analysts said the firm's latest earnings report, which could be the last one Mr Ballmer presides over, would allow him to leave on a positive note. ""It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current chief executive,"" said Colin Gillis from BGC Financial. However, others have questioned the company's new focus on manufacturing hardware like tablets and smartphones.

Sony to sell PC unit and cut jobs,"The company will also split its TV division into a separate subsidiary as part of its restructuring programme. The moves were announced as Sony forecast a net loss of 110bn yen ($1.08bn; Â£665m) for the financial year to 31 March, revising its earlier projection of a 30bn yen profit. The TV and PC units have been a big drag on its earnings in recent years. Last month, ratings agency Moody's cited concerns over the two divisions as a key reason behind its move to cut the Japanese firm's credit rating to junk status. Moody's said at the time that it expected earnings from Sony's core businesses to continue to face ""significant"" downward pressure. The annual loss forecast came despite Sony reporting a net profit of 27bn yen for the October-to-December quarter, up from a net loss of 10.8bn yen during the same period a year ago. Restructuring divisions Sony's TV division has been hurt by increased competition and slowing global demand. A decline in TV prices has further hurt the profitability of the unit. The firm has taken some steps to try to turn around the TV division, including cutting costs and shifting its focus to developing high-end TV models. Sony said the moves had helped it to narrow losses in the division to 69.6bn yen in the last financial year, down from 147.5bn yen a year ago. It added that it expected the losses to be reduced further to 25bn yen in the current financial year. Sony Corp's CEO, Kazuo Hirai, said there were no plans for the company's TV business to share the same fate as its PC division. ""We are beginning to see the path to a turnaround in our TV business,"" he said. ""TV remains an important category for Sony."" However, it said its previous target of returning both the TV and PC businesses to profitability would not be achieved within the current financial year. Sony said that splitting the unit into a wholly-owned subsidiary would help it ""further enhance"" the unit's profit structure and return the business to profitability. Meanwhile, a continued decline in global PC sales - which have fallen for six quarters in a row - have hurt its PC unit. Smartphone focus Sony said it had decided to sell the division and concentrate on making smartphones and tablets - two sectors that are seeing robust growth. Sony has already benefitted from the growth in these sectors, saying that ""a significant increase in smartphones"" had boosted its earnings in the last three months of 2013. It aims to finalise an agreement to sell its PC business, which operates under the Vaio brand, to Japan Industrial Partners by the end of next month. Of the 5,000 job cuts announced, about 1,500 will come from Japan, and the rest from Sony's oversees operations. Those cuts come on top the 10,000 job losses Sony has announced over the previous year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cambridgeshire plesiosaur 'sea monster' could be 'new species',"Oxford archaeologists discovered the 165 million-year-old reptile bones at Must Farm quarry near Whittlesey. Dr Carl Harrington and his team dug up more than 600 pieces of bone as well as the skull, still preserved in clay. ""Eve"", described as ""a fantastic fossil"", has anatomical features only before seen in plesiosaurs half her size, a palaeontologist said. Plesiosaurs were sea creatures that lived at the time of the dinosaurs. Read more on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire Eve's ""snout"" was the first thing Dr Harrington noticed as he was digging around in the wet clay. ""It was one of those absolute 'wow' moments. I was the first human to come face-to-face with this reptile,"" he said. In all, the team from Oxford Clay Working Group dug up hundreds of pieces of fossilised bone and spent more than 400 hours cleaning and repairing the remains. ""I'd never seen so much bone in one spot in a quarry,"" Dr Harrington added. Almost all of the plesiosaur's bones have been found, although the hind flippers and parts of the fore-flippers are still missing. The site of Eve's final resting place - owned by building product manufacturing company Forterra - has given up a number of important finds over the years. Cambridge archaeologists are currently excavating the remains of a Bronze Age settlement described as ""Britain's Pompeii"" because it is so well-preserved. However, Eve is much older and palaeontologists have reason to think she is a ""previously unknown species of plesiosaur"". Plesiosaurs (Plesiosauroidea) Source: Oxford University palaeontologist Dr Roger Benson/BBC Nature The skeleton is currently being studied by experts at Oxford University's Museum of Natural History. Palaeontologist Dr Roger Benson said although Eve has a long neck, which is not uncommon, she also has ""some anatomical features only seen in Picrocleidus, a plesiosaur about half the size of this new skeleton"". The Must Farm specimen had an 8ft (2.5m)-long neck, a barrel-shaped body, four flippers and a short tail. Scientists are currently working to remove the skull from inside a block of clay. It has been CT-scanned by the Royal Veterinary College to enable them to accurately locate the bones without damaging them. Eve was donated by Cambridgeshire landowners Forterra to the Oxford museum, who said they were ""very excited"" to have the new ""sea monster"" in their collection.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chris Christie rules himself out of White House race,"Mr Christie held a news conference at the governor's office, where he told reporters: ""Now is not my time."" The Republican has spent the past week reconsidering calls from the party to run for president. He would not be drawn on endorsing any of the Republican pack, currently led by Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. ""I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon,"" Mr Christie said. The governor repeated throughout the press conference that he did not want to leave the job to which he was elected, either through campaigning or resigning if he won. ""In the end what I've always felt was the right decision remains the right decision today,"" he said. He added: ""You're stuck with me"". 'Too late' Encouragement from Republicans like Henry Kissinger, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush had led him to reconsider a bid. But correspondents said that jumping into the race a few weeks before the filing deadline would have left Mr Christie far behind his rivals in fundraising and organising. The Associated Press news agency reports that advisers to Mr Christie had said his decision was in part because it would have been too late to set up the needed infrastructure. Elected governor in 2009, Mr Christie has a reputation as a tough-talking, fiscally conservative governor. Mr Christie did not rule out a future presidential bid and used his moment in the national spotlight to criticise President Barack Obama. ""This is an example of someone who has failed the leadership test,"" Mr Christie said. ""You can't be taught how to lead and make decisions."" His announcement will swing focus back to the two leaders of the race for the Republican nomination to challenge Mr Obama in the November 2012 presidential elections. Texas Governor Perry's lead has proved fragile after he was criticised for controversial remarks on the campaign trail and over his TV debating performance. And former Massachusetts Governor Romney has struggled to win over Tea Party supporters and conservative Republicans. A new Washington Post/ABC poll shows Mr Romney regaining the lead among the Republican candidates, although his support has remained relatively static for months. The survey placed businessman Herman Cain - who has won praise for recent strong debating performances - tied on second place with Mr Perry.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Gay marriage opposed by Welsh ministers David Jones and Stephen Crabb,"His fellow Conservative and Wales Office deputy Stephen Crabb will also oppose the move. Prime Minister David Cameron faces criticism from some Tories for supporting the idea, with Monmouth MP David Davies calling it ""barking mad"". Mr Davies said the party would lose loyal activists if it pressed ahead with the policy. Mr Jones, the MP for Clwyd West, declined to give interviews on the UK government's same sex marriage plans as ""this bears no relation to his role as secretary of state for Wales"". Mr Crabb, the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, fears the proposals will not protect places of worship from a legal challenge should they refuse to carry out ceremonies. At the weekend, Mr Davies said the idea was ""barking mad"". He risked causing controversy by saying most parents ""would prefer their children not to be gay, knowing most parents want grandchildren if nothing else"". The UK government will set out its plans soon after a consultation on measures to allow homosexual couples to marry. Some senior Tory MPs and peers have launched a campaign group backing same sex marriage. The leader of the Conservatives in the assembly Andrew RT Davies also added his support on Twitter, saying: ""The best thing to happen in my life was to meet and marry my wife, it cannot be right to deny two people in love the same feeling"". Free vote However, more than 100 Tory MPs are thought to be against legislation, which is expected early next year and on which Mr Cameron has promised a free vote. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""People have strong views on this issue. The prime minister has strong views as well, and he thinks gay people should not be excluded from marriage. ""We will come forward with our proposals in the next few days. The prime minister's made clear that it will be a free vote for members of parliament."" Under the proposals, churches and other venues will be allowed to ""opt in"" to holding civil marriage ceremonies. Mr Cameron has promised that no institution will be forced to marry gay people on their premises if they are opposed to it.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police',"The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said evidence from undercover officer Mark Kennedy had not been properly shared or recorded. But these ""collective failings"" in the prosecution case of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar protesters were not misconduct. The IPCC also found CPS lawyers signed off reports without reading them. In 2009, Nottinghamshire Police arrested more than 100 people from a group that Mr Kennedy had infiltrated. Twenty of them were convicted in December 2010 of plotting to shut down the coal-powered Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station near Nottingham. 'Not well handled' But a second proposed trial of six more protesters collapsed in January 2011 after it emerged that the officer wanted to use his secret recordings to help the defence. The collapse of the trial led the Court of Appeal to quash the convictions of the first 20 protesters when it emerged that Mr Kennedy had infiltrated and potentially entrapped environmental activists. Len Jackson, a commissioner with the IPCC, said: ""Our investigation has shown that the sharing and recording of sensitive information, initially between the various officers involved and then with the CPS, was not well handled. ""In particular, where the use of an undercover officer has been authorised, the police need to be meticulous in their handling and dissemination of any evidential material and ensuring that liaison with the CPS is well documented. ""Whilst there were some weaknesses in the manner in which Nottinghamshire Police officers and staff carried out their disclosure duties in this case, it is our view that none of their actions amount to misconduct."" In a statement, Nottinghamshire Police said: ""We are pleased that the IPCC concludes that the evidence produced by the undercover police officer was disclosed by the force to the CPS many months before the trial collapsed and that therefore no officer should face any disciplinary action."" 'Unearthed serious criminality' Following the appeals of the 20 protesters, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary reviewed the activities of Mark Kennedy and other undercover officers. Its report found that Mr Kennedy helped unearth ""serious criminality"" albeit with a ""lack of specific outcomes"". The report suggested that an independent body might be required to authorise deployments. It also said Mr Kennedy was inadequately supervised and oversight of undercover officers needed to be strengthened. The report said that during his seven years undercover, Mr Kennedy had become ""resistant to management intervention"" and carried on working ""contrary to instructions"" after being arrested in 2006. The review made four recommendations for more robust controls of undercover police work. These include greater oversight by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners and a thorough review of all operations that last more than six months.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Middlesbrough Council children's services supervision continues,"Middlesbrough Council was praised for its response to a finding in January of ""serious and widespread failures"". The report said children were left too long in harmful situations and risks were not properly recognised. A government official supervising improvements said the service did not need to be removed from the council. Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston said: ""Retaining control of the service is the result we wanted, but we know how much work is still required. ""This is the first significant step on a long road of recovery for the council. ""I made clear after the Ofsted report that we had no excuses for letting Middlesbrough children down and need to repeat that today."" 'Accepted responsibility' Commissioner for children's services Peter Dwyer was appointed to oversee improvements after the Ofsted report. He said: ""A new senior leadership team is in place within children's services which carries significant relevant experience and enhanced credibility. Improvement was under way and there was evidence ""some of the most concerning issues"" were being addressed, he said. Coronavirus had affected the speed of change but there was no need to remove control of the service from the council, he said. The Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson said ""while there has been some improvement, the council is still failing to perform to an adequate standard"" and agreed supervision of the service should continue for another year. 'Mostly ineffective' Middlesbrough has one of the highest rates of children requiring care in the UK and the percentage of the council's budget earmarked for the service has increased from 13% to 35% since 2010, the authority said. Deputy mayor Antony High, who took on the role of executive member of children's services following the Ofsted report, said there was ""a lot of work to do and we're determined to put things right"". The previous executive director of children's services, Helen Watson, stood down in February. A three-week inspection of the service last year found risks were not identified and responded to effectively, ""particularly in relation to long-standing concerns of chronic neglect and wider exploitation"". Help for children vulnerable to exploitation was ""mostly ineffective"", inspectors found. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Tikrit: Iran key in fight to wrest city from IS,"By Nafiseh Kohnavard BBC Persian, Beirut Shia militia sources in Iraq have confirmed that Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force is personally taking part in leading the operation. Tikrit, 150km (95 miles) north of Baghdad, has been occupied by IS for more than eight months and an offensive to recapture it was declared by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. The Iraqi army and security forces along with Shia militia groups who call themselves Popular Mobilisation units are pushing into Tikrit from several directions. As sources on the ground have told BBC Persian, a number of IRGC officers were involved at a command level before the operation was officially launched. Iranian authorities are yet to comment officially but Iran's Fars news agency, considered to be very close to the Revolutionary Guards, has extensively reported on the role of Gen Soleimani in the operation. It has even published photographs that show the general among Iraqi commanders and officials, saying they were taken around Tikrit. Iranian allegiance One of the groups in the Popular Mobilisation units is Saraya al-Khorasani (Khorasani Brigades), who say they are under the command of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A Brigades commander told BBC Persian that Iranian forces under Gen Soleimani were training and morally preparing Iraqi Shia fighters for the operation long before it began. Although Iran was left out by the US and its allies when they formed a coalition against IS last year, its direct involvement in fighting IS militants in Iraq was revealed long before the coalition was formed. Since last summer, a number of Shia militia groups have emerged in Iraq that openly pledge their allegiance to Iran and declare themselves as followers of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian officials have always pointed out that their country is helping both Shia and Kurdish forces in the fight against IS but it was in a battle in late August 2014 that Iran's direct military involvement was made clear. Back then, Iranian forces were playing an openly active role in helping Kurdish and Shia forces take back the town of Amerli from IS in a joint operation. It was during the battle of Amerli that BBC Persian accessed the weapons and ammunitions sent from Iran for the militia forces. Gen Soleimani's has been the recognisable face of Iran's influence and involvement in Iraq since the fight against IS began. Now, if the operation to liberate Tikrit leads to success then it will mark a victory for Iran and its man in the field who may add to his titles, the conqueror of the home town of his old enemy, former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Pte Sean Benton: Sister hopes Army will learn from Deepcut inquest,"Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five gunshot wounds to his chest at the Surrey army base in 1995. The coroner, Judge Peter Rook QC, concluded on Wednesday that he suffered a mental deterioration after verbal and physical attacks by his colleagues. Tracy Lewis said: ""If they don't learn by this, it will happen again."" The inquest heard evidence from more than 170 witnesses since it began in January, and followed a 23-year campaign by Pte Benton's family amid allegations of prolonged bullying at the base. Mr Rook concluded his death was from suicide. He said it was clear he was vulnerable at the time and that he might still be alive if he had had proper support from the Army. Pte Benton was the first of four young recruits to die from gunshot wounds in unexplained circumstances at the Army barracks near Camberley between 1995 and 2002. He shot himself while on guard duty on 9 June 1995. An initial inquest, held a month after his death, recorded a verdict of suicide, although no evidence was given about his experiences at Deepcut. The extent of the abuse he suffered was revealed during the second inquest. Ms Lewis said: ""Putting his face in a puddle, or making him do press-ups over a girl - humiliating him in front of everybody, and hitting him in the back of the ribs. ""There's so much that came out that I didn't know what they'd done."" She added: ""The people that were there, that he could seek help from, were actually the people that were bullying him."" The family are now calling for a criminal investigation into the assaults on Pte Benton and misconduct in public office. Surrey Police's investigation was criticised by the coroner, but it said changes had since been made ""at both local and national level, to policy and training regarding both investigative practices and processes"". Jim Collinson, whose 17-year-old son James died from a single bullet while on guard duty at Deepcut in 2002, has called for a public inquiry into the four deaths. Speaking after Wednesday's inquest conclusions, he said his son had been let down. ""Come night-time you either hid or were abused... the same stories come up over and over again. ""Not enough NCOs to create a safe environment, abuse there from the start, everyone seems to have turned a blind eye,"" he said. On Friday, a pre-inquest review is due to be held into the death of the third soldier to die at Deepcut, Pte Geoff Gray.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Newquay man weeding his way around town,"Alex Russell, from Newquay in Cornwall, suffers with anxiety and depression but said starting the activity during the lockdown helped with his mental health. The 21-year-old said: ""I just want to keep the town looking nice and make it beautiful."" His local police force said officers had spoken to him and were happy he was following social distancing advice. Mr Russell, who lives with his mum, sister and nephew, has been receiving lots of praise from local residents, including Lisa Paul who said he had a ""heart of gold"". ""He's doing a great job around our community tidying up the streets of weeds and rubbish off his own back,"" she said. ""He's only 21 years old, [it's a] shame more youngsters aren't like Alex."" As well as weeding the pavements and pathways, Mr Russell has also taken his scraper to the outdoor areas at the Royal British Legion and Age UK buildings. ""I want to show my support for the NHS and key workers by showing everyone we live in a beautiful place,"" he said. Devon and Cornwall Police said officers had spoken to Mr Russell and were satisfied he was operating within the guidelines. So far he has cleaned four streets and said he always wore a mask and gloves and kept at least 2m away from other people. He has hand sanitiser in his wheelbarrow, along with tools that have been lent by neighbours. Mr Russell said he would like to eventually clear up the whole town but was focusing on a street at a time for now. ""When I'm with my tools, with my hoe, and with my scraper, I feel free,"" he said. ""And people walking past, what I think they are thinking about me doesn't bother me anymore, because I know I'm doing good for the community and for people who love this town.

British Airways fined Â£20m over data breach,"The breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data. The fine is considerably smaller than the Â£183m that the ICO originally said it intended to issue back in 2019. It said ""the economic impact of Covid-19"" had been taken into account. However, it is still the largest penalty issued by the ICO to date. The incident took place when BA's systems were compromised by its attackers, and then modified to harvest customers' details as they were input. It was two months before BA was made aware of it by a security researcher, and then notified the ICO. The data stolen included log in, payment card and travel booking details as well name and address information. A subsequent investigation concluded that sufficient security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, were not in place at the time. The ICO noted that some of these measures were available on the Microsoft operating system that BA was using at the time. ""When organisations take poor decisions around people's personal data, that can have a real impact on people's lives. The law now gives us the tools to encourage businesses to make better decisions about data, including investing in up-to-date security,"" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. British Airways said it had alerted customers as soon as it had found out about the attack on its systems. ""We are pleased the ICO recognises that we have made considerable improvements to the security of our systems since the attack and that we fully co-operated with its investigation,"" said a spokesman. Data protection officer Carl Gottlieb said that in the current climate, Â£20m was a ""massive"" fine. ""It shows the ICO means business and is not letting struggling companies off the hook for their data protection failures,"" he said. It's taken more than two years for BA to face the music over this extremely serious incident. The company breached data protection law and failed to protect themselves from preventable cyber attack. It then failed to detect the hack until the damage was done to hundreds of thousands of customers. The lag between incident and fine has raised eyebrows in privacy circles but I understand the Information Commissioner's Office has been working methodically to get it right. This is the commissioner's first major fine under the EU data regulation GDPR and was being watched closely by the rest of Europe as a potential landmark decision. The final figure of Â£20m has come as a shock to many who were expecting it to be closer to the eye-watering Â£183m initially proposed but it is still a significant moment for data privacy and GDPR. Other companies will look at the fine as a shape of things to come if they also fail to protect customers. In a post-Covid world, the ICO may not be as gentle.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Richard Desmond 'plans National Lottery bid',"The plans by Mr Desmond, who runs the Health Lottery, have been reported in the Financial Times. Camelot has held the UK's lottery franchise since it was set up in 1994. A challenge to its monopoly would be the first since Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group failed to win the franchise in 2000. Camelot has the right to run the National Lottery until 2023 - after securing a four-year extension to its contract in 2012. It expected the franchise renewal process will begin in 2019. A bid would be made through Mr Desmond's company, Northern and Shell, which owns his newspaper and magazine titles. He has run the loss-making Health Lottery since 2011. It is not a national lottery but a collection of 51 local society lotteries that raise funds for health-related good causes. However, they collectively pay out less in winnings than the National Lottery. Camelot failed in a 2012 High Court bid to have the Gambling Commission's licence for the Health Lottery revoked. Martin Ellice, joint managing director of Northern and Shell, told the FT the company would make a bid, saying: ""We're in the lottery business now."" Mr Desmond sold Channel 5 to Viacom, the MTV and Nickelodeon owner, for Â£450m in 2014 and is in talks with the Mirror Group to sell the Express and Star titles. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, one of Canada's biggest pension funds, bought Camelot for Â£389m in 2010. Northern and Shell is expected to highlight its UK ownership in its bid. Paul Ashford, the company's group editorial director, told the FT: ""The British people would not mind a British company doing the British lottery."" Earlier this year Camelot announced a strategic review after ticket sales fell by 8.8% to just under Â£7.6bn for the 12 months to 31 March. Camelot has argued that greater competition would reduce the share of ticket sales that go to winners, good causes and in tax. That figure stood at 95%, the company said. The National Lottery has awarded more than Â£63bn in prize money, making some 4,600 people millionaires. Camelot declined to comment further. Northern and Shell could not be reached by the BBC. The BBC broadcast the Saturday National Lottery draws on BBC One until January this year, but now shows them on iPlayer. The National Lottery Awards, which recognises recipients of National Lottery Good Causes funding, will continue to be shown on BBC One.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scientists find 'better way' to grow adult stem cells,"Standard surfaces have proved limited for growing large amounts and retaining the stem cells' useful characteristics. It is hoped the discovery could lead to the creation of stem cell therapies for re-growing bone and tissue, and also for conditions such as arthritis. The study was carried out by Glasgow and Southampton universities. The new ""nano-patterned"" surface was created using a manufacturing process similar to that used to make Blu-ray discs. The surface is covered with tiny pits, which the researchers said made it more effective in allowing stem cells to grow and spread into useful cells for therapy. Currently, when adult stem cells are harvested from a patient, they are then cultured in a laboratory to increase the quantities of cells and create a batch of sufficient volume to kick-start the process of cellular regeneration. At this point they can be reintroduced back into the patient. The process of culturing is made difficult because stem cells grown on standard plastic tissue culture surfaces do not always expand to create new stem cells but instead create other cells which are of no use in therapy. Stem cell expansion can be boosted by immersing the cells in chemical solutions, but the scientists said these methods were limited in their effectiveness. Dr Matthew Dalby, from the University of Glasgow, led the research alongside colleague Dr Nikolaj Gadegaard and Prof Richard Oreffo of the University of Southampton. 'Stem cell factories' Mr Dalby said: ""This new nano-structured surface can be used to very effectively culture mesencyhmal stem cells, taken from sources such as bone marrow, which can then be put to use in musculoskeletal, orthopaedic and connective tissues. ""If the same process can be used to culture other types of stem cells too - and this research is under way in our labs - our technology could be the first step on the road to developing large-scale stem cell culture factories, which would allow for the creation of a wide range of therapies for many common diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease."" He said the group hoped to make the surface commercially available. Prof Oreffo added: ""It is important to realise the ability to retain skeletal stem cell phenotype using surface topography offers a step change in current approaches for stem cell biology. ""The implications for research and future interventions for patients with arthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases are substantial."" The study was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the University of Glasgow. The paper, Nanoscale surfaces for the long-term maintenance of mesenchymalstem cell phenotype and multipotency, was published in the journal Nature Materials.

"Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says","Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, the Ministry of Justice said. Prisoners will only be allowed out for a specific purpose, such as work experience, and day-release prisoners will also have to wear electronic tags. Campaigners criticised the move, saying there had been only a few failures. But the MoJ cited several of the cases in which there had been serious failings as being behind the move. They include that of Ian McLoughlin, who was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, last July, while on day release. McLoughlin, who had killed twice before, was sentenced to a whole-life order. Another incident, which led to an offender being convicted of attempted robbery, also prompted the change, the department said. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: ""We're not prepared to see the failures of last summer repeated and public safety compromised. ""Temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but it should not be an automatic right and we must do all we can to ensure it does not lead to a permanent blight on innocent members of society. ""The system has been too lax up to now and that must change. ""In future when prisoners are let out on licence I want to be sure they are tagged and strictly risk-assessed so we know where they have been and can be sure that they have been tested in the community under strict conditions before being released."" 'Terrible cases' The MoJ said that, from now on, prisoners eligible for release on temporary licence would have to earn it by demonstrating the ""right behaviour and a commitment to change"". It will no longer be considered an automatic right which is given when inmates are deemed suitable for open conditions. There will also be a more thorough assessment of risks before temporary release is authorised. For prisoners with a history of serious crimes, there will be a new ""restricted"" level where they will undergo stringent risk assessments by probation and other professionals. Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ""For a government committed to rehabilitation, justice ministers should feel ashamed that only a quarter of men, and fewer than one in 10 women, leave prison with a job to go to, and proud that their well-established release on temporary licence programme has worked over years to help thousands of prisoners go straight on release. ""Now, in the face of a thankfully few terrible cases, and for the sake of a tough headline, they risk destroying a programme that has proved its worth instead of investigating its few failures and learning from its many successes.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Historical child abuse support call by Simon Danczuk MP,"Simon Danczuk's comments come after it emerged South Wales Police are looking into claims former House of Commons speaker George Thomas abused a child. Viscount Tonypandy, who was a Labour MP in Cardiff from 1945 to 1983, died of cancer in 1997, aged 88. The alleged victim, now aged 55, told the Mirror newspaper he was sexually abused by him in the 1960s and 1970s. South Wales Police admitted the claims were first made in 2013 although they failed at first to contact the complainant. The force has referred the matter to the police watchdog, the IPCC. Mr Danczuk, who exposed child sex abuse allegations against former Liberal MP Cyril Smith, said since the separate investigation into abuse by former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile, there has been a ""new air around that enables victims to come forward and share their experiences"". 'Come forward' ""I think there has been a culture change within all police forces across the United Kingdom in relation to child sex abuse, including historic child sex abuse,"" said Mr Danczuk, MP for Rochdale. ""I know that there has been a reluctance within some police forces to look at historic child sex abuse not least because they have limited resources so what we do need to see is for government to make sure that police forces are adequately resourced to be able to investigate these very, very serious allegations."" The MP also expressed his belief that more allegations could be made as the investigations into the late viscount continue. ""We know from the investigations around Cyril Smith that I've researched in detail that the police can quite easily identify other victims of their abuser,"" said Mr Danczuk. At the weekend, South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Holland said: ""It is important that victims have the confidence to come forward and speak to us. ""We take any allegations regarding sexual assault or rape extremely seriously and urge anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to make contact with us.""

Cancer costing European Union countries 'billions',"The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a ""huge burden"". The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care. Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease. The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009. The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (Â£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs. Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (Â£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (Â£19.5bn) euro. Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. Other issues However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease. An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (Â£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (Â£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe. Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer. One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: ""By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment."" Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: ""It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas. ""More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates."" Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: ""The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden. ""This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness. ""We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Losing GSP+ can be 'very negative',"Sri Lanka could lose special trading rights with the bloc because of a failure to improve its human rights record, the European Union warned on Monday. A year-long inquiry by the EU has revealed ""significant shortcomings"" in Sri Lanka's human rights efforts. The European Commission now says it will ask the 27 EU member states if it should suspend trade privileges. Deputy secretary of the Joint Apparel Forum (JAF), Rohan Masakorala, said that over fifty percent of Sri Lankaâs total apparel exports were shifted to the EU since the facility was granted in 2005. 50 percent of exports He said Sri Lankan exporters had the privilege of providing apparel exports to the EU âon zero duty baseâ as a result of the concession. âIn the event this facility is withdrawn, price of our products, apparel would go up by ten percent. It is huge price increase for any product,â he told BBC Sandeshaya. âSo finally it is up to the buyer whether to purchase for a higher price or find cheaper products from elsewhere. Losing the privileged position we have in the EU can have a heavy impact on the industry. If we have less demand, the production will be reduced making job losses and reduction of revenue.â Deals with the EU worth more than $100m (Â£62m, 67m Euros) are linked to Sri Lanka's human rights record. The European Union's 12-month inquiry was launched during Sri Lanka's final offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels in the north of the country. Torture and violence It found evidence of torture, police violence and breaches of child labour laws, officials say. The report outlines how it expects Sri Lanka to take ""vigorous, rapid and verifiable"" action to tackle discrepancies over its current human rights record. Mr. Masakorala recalled how the impact of the withdrawal of US quota system in 2005 was negated by the EU trade concession. A decision on suspending Sri Lanka's trade incentives could be taken by the end of November and take effect from early next summer, reports suggest. The Sri Lanka government, responding to the report, said it will continue the dialogue with the EU. âThe GoSL for its part will continue to engage with the European Institutions, in-keeping with the spirit of transparency and mutual respect that is appropriate to the historic and long standing relationship between Europe and Sri Lanka,â a statement issued by Sri Lanka foreign ministry said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Man guilty of killing unborn baby by kicking mum's stomach,"Malorie Bantala, 22, was ambushed outside her Peckham home by Kevin Wilson, 22, and a teenager on 15 June. She suffered life-threatening internal bleeding and a fractured hand. The baby boy was delivered stillborn. Wilson of Longfield Estate, Bermondsey, and his 17-year-old accomplice were both convicted of child destruction and causing grievous bodily harm. Their actions were described as ""incomprehensibly evil"" by Malcolm McHaffie of the Crown Prosecution Service. Miss Bantala, who was 32 weeks pregnant, had been buying decorations for her baby shower before the attack. As she approached, Wilson - a teaching assistant - and his accomplice emerged from the bushes outside her flat, where they had been lying in wait with their faces hidden in crash helmets. Jurors were told they launched a brutal attack, targeting Miss Bantala's bump as she lay curled up on the ground, trying to protect her unborn child with one hand. Malorie Bantala's impact statement read to court Miss Bantala said the ""real victim"" was her son Joel. She wrote: ""Joel never got to meet me properly, never know how much I love him. ""I will never get to see him smile, watch him get his first tooth or to take his first steps. I will never get to watch him at university or see him graduate. ""I will never get to be the mother of the groom. I love my son so much words cannot describe it. The moment Joel was taken from me I lost everything."" Miss Bantala, a Marks & Spencer worker, told the Old Bailey: ""I had screamed 'Kevin' for him to stop but he continued to kick my stomach. They were harsh kicks."" Afterwards, they made off on the youth's Vespa scooter, which was never found. When the verdict was returned, Miss Bantala jumped from the well of the court and screamed at Wilson: ""I'm going to kill you. You don't understand. I hate you. Drop dead."" She then ran from the court in tears. Jurors had heard how Miss Bantala had been in an on-off relationship with Wilson and had turned to him for comfort after the death of a nephew from sickle-cell anaemia. She decided to keep the baby, despite Wilson's repeated attempts to persuade her to have an abortion because he was not ready for fatherhood. Wilson apologised for his behaviour as he told jurors: ""When I look back on it now, I could have behaved much better."" Judge Mark Lucraft QC adjourned sentencing to a date to be fixed in February. The maximum sentence for the offence of child destruction is life.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tenerife beheading: Murder suspect 'haunted by voices',"Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov, 29, said he is haunted by voices that ""direct how I act"", and admitted having taken crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest. Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, who was a retired council worker from Norwich, was stabbed repeatedly and decapitated in a Los Cristianos shop in May 2011. Mr Deyanov has denied murder. Ms Mills-Westley's two daughters, Sarah and Samantha Mills-Westley, were in court for the first day of Mr Deyanov's trial. Prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez told the provincial court in the island's capital Santa Cruz that Mr Deyanov had approached Ms Mills-Westley before ""attacking and striking her repeatedly with a knife in her back and neck until she was completely decapitated"". 'Justice done' The court was shown CCTV footage of the attack, which took place inside a Chinese-owned supermarket on Avenida Juan Carlos I. The nine members of the jury were also shown two 22cm-long knives thought to have been used in the attack, one of which was bent and covered in blood. Speaking in court, Sarah Mills-Westley, from Norwich, said her mother, a grandmother-of-five, had been concerned about safety on the island in the months before her death. The 43-year-old from Norwich, said: ""It was nothing specific but she was increasingly concerned that Tenerife was not as safe as when we used to visit 30 years ago. ""All I want to see is justice done for my mum."" Jennifer Mills-Westley had been living in Tenerife after retiring from her job as a road safety officer with Norfolk County Council. Mr Deyanov's lawyer, Francisco Beltran, insisted his client had ""committed no crime"" and claimed he had been a ""sick man"" living without diagnosis or treatment for acute schizophrenia. 'Kill, fight, hit, pray' Answering questions in Bulgarian via an interpreter, Mr Deyanov said voices had told him he was ""an angel of Jesus Christ who is going to create a new Jerusalem"". ""They direct how I act, sometimes they say kill, fight, hit, pray,"" he added. Mr Deyanov insisted he did not recognise himself in the CCTV footage of the stabbing and likened it to watching ""a montage, a film"". He admitted he had used crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but said he had no memory of having lived in Tenerife. He also could not recall being taken to Tenerife from a psychiatric unit in Seville, Spain, or having lived in Wales, where he was sectioned in 2010 under the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital. The jury also heard evidence from witness Davide Balsamo, an Italian who has lived in Tenerife for five years. He said: ""I came out of the shop and suddenly I saw him [Deyanov] come off the kerb, completely covered in blood. ""I ran up to him and hit him with all my strength using my motorcycle helmet and knocked him silly."" Mr Garcia Rodriguez is seeking a 20-year jail term, to be served in a secure psychiatric unit. The trial has been adjourned until Wednesday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Tata Steel: Pension fund deficit deters buyers, says Javid","The pension fund has more than 130,000 members and a deficit of Â£485m. He told the Business select committee: ""It's not unreasonable ... to say 'look we're interested in the assets but this would be an issue'."" Pension fund trustees were in talks with the regulator, Mr Javid said. Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, told MPs that a sale would not happen unless the pension fund deficit was addressed. ""If we don't solve it we are staring at some very bad consequences for the taxpayer ... We are staring at a huge economic and social disaster,"" he said. Mr Javid reiterated that the Government would not take a stake of more than 25% in Tata Steel's UK assets and that he wanted a sale of Tata's steel assets completed as soon as possible. The business secretary denied he had been on the back foot throughout the crisis. He said with hindsight he should have attended a Tata board meeting in Mumbai in March when Tata decided to sell its UK business. At the time he was on an official visit to Australia. More help Mr Javid insisted he had been working with Tata since February to find a buyer for its steel business after he discovered it was planning to close Port Talbot. Tata's Mr Jha told MPs that the government needed to do more to help the company find a buyer. Although there was no set deadline for a sale, he said that Tata could not continue to ""bleed"" indefinitely. Mr Jha said Tata was not prepared to split up its UK steel assets to secure a sale: ""We would not deal with ... somebody saying leave alone Port Talbot and give us the rest - that is not a solution that's acceptable."" He blamed the sale on ""structural weaknesses"" in the UK, such as high energy costs and business rates. ""If we were at the same electricity costs as Germany , then [Tata Steel UK] would be Â£40m better off - we would not be having negative numbers,"" Mr Jha told MPs. ""We would not be selling the business if we were not losing money"" David Cameron visited the Port Talbot steelworks in South Wales on Tuesday in a bid to assure workers of the Government's commitment to support the plant's future. The UK government has said it would consider taking a stake in Tata Steel UK. Stuart Wilkie, Tata Steel UK's director at Port Talbot and Llanwern, is working on plans for a management buyout. Downing Street said the government was doing all it could to secure a ""sustainable future"" for the plant.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wales weather: M4 clear after Storm Frank flooding,"Police dealt with three separate crashes where there was standing water on both sides of the carriageway between junctions 35 (Pencoed) and 36 (Sarn). Flooding also blocked one lane on the eastbound stretch at junction 26 for Malpas but it has now reopened. The Met Office weather warning for rain was in place until 18:00 GMT. Strong winds led to the closure of one lane in both directions of the M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire. Natural Resources Wales said less rain fell overnight than expected but warned some rivers would be very high, fast flowing and dangerous. Rivers were expected to peak by early afternoon. Localised flooding has been reported in Pontypool in Torfaen, Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, Ferryside in Carmarthenshire and Llanishen in Cardiff. Three flood warnings are in place for the Lower Dee Valley in Wrexham, Abergwili in Carmarthenshire and Pontargothi and Pontynyswen in Carmarthenshire.

Cambridgeshire teen felt 'not believed' after abuse probe dropped,"Chris Gould, 17, died in January 2019 while an informal patient at a mental health unit near Cambridge. Her parents told the inquest that clinicians felt alleged abuse was the ""root"" of her mental health problems. Last month, the coroner found there were ""shortcomings"" around the death of her twin sister Sam in September 2018. Chris's inquest at Huntingdon Town Hall heard a statement from her parents Ian Gould and Jane Cannon. It said she was a keen snowboarder, ""adored"" horse riding and that she and her sister were ""fiercely, fiercely loyal to one another"". Mrs Cannon said: ""[Chris] loved writing - her creative writing throughout school was always commented on."" Mrs Cannon told the inquest she had been to many concerts with Chris, and one of her favourite bands was Creeper, who ""we followed all around the country"". While being taken through evidence by coroner Nicholas Moss QC, her parents said the alleged abuse first began in 2007. The inquest heard that aged about 14 or 15 it became ""clear"" the twins were struggling with their mental health, and in May 2016 Chris made an attempt to take her own life. The following month the alleged abuse was disclosed to police, but later that year they were told by Hampshire Constabulary there would be no further action. The parents agreed that both Chris and Sam felt ""invalidated and not believed"" after the investigation ended. If you are affected by issues raised in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line. If you or someone you know needs support for issues relating to mental health, these organisations may be also able to help. Mrs Cannon had earlier told the coroner that the parents had ""never doubted... for a moment"" the honesty and reliability of what they had been told about the alleged abuse. She said health professionals accepted that abuse was the ""root of the mental health problems"". Sam's inquest was told the criminal investigation was closed because the sisters had not wanted to provide an evidential account in a video interview. Mr Moss found at the previous inquest that Sam's borderline personality disorder was the ""main cause of her death"", which was assessed ""to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood"" and that she had taken her own life from an overdose of prescription drugs. Mrs Cannon said that following Sam's death: ""We were horribly aware that what was already an uphill battle was considerably steeper."" The inquest heard Chris, from Fulbourn near Cambridge, was an informal patient at the Darwin Centre, a mental health unit in Fulbourn run by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust. The court heard she died on 26 January 2019 on a railway track. The hearing continues. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Chase criticised for 'mocking' customers' spending habits,"By Georgina RannardBBC News Offering financial advice on Twitter, the bank appeared to chastise consumers who question their low bank balances but buy take-away coffee and short taxi rides. The meme was deleted shortly after it was posted on Monday, but not before critics including high-profile lawmakers highlighted the bank's own financial practices. In 2008 Chase received a $25 billion government bailout in the US foreclosure crisis. The meme suggested a conversation between a Chase customer and their account about a low bank balance. When the hypothetical bank user fails to see that buying take-away coffee or taxi rides could be behind their drained finances, the 'account' replies ""seriously?"" Many online took exception to the tone of the advice, including several high-profile politicians. Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter suggested that higher salaries would help workers save more, and she called on the bank's chief executive to apologise. In April Rep Porter's grilling of Chase's parent company JP Morgan's CEO over pay disparity went viral. When asked to explain how one of his bank's starting employees could make ends meet, Jamie Dimon replied: ""I don't know, I'd have to think about that."" You might also like: Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president in 2020, offered her own take on Chase's meme by referring to low wages, rising costs, and the bank's government bailout. Others suggested that the reason workers struggle to balance the books was due to the high cost of rent or medical bills rather than coffee and cabs. Chase customers also took the opportunity to highlight fees and charges levied by the bank, suggesting they don't aid keeping a healthy balance. However others suggested that too many people ""live beyond their means"" and that Chase offered sound financial advice. The tweet came at a time of heightened criticism of financial practices in the US. In April, banking executives faced criticism during a hearing of Congress House Financial Services committee assessing the sector's preparedness since the recession. Representatives grilled a group of CEOs on business and social issues including the financing of gun makers, low wages, and funding America's private prison system. Following the hearing, JP Morgan's CEO defended the bank's wages, saying: ""We take very good care of our entry-level jobs: $35,000 to $37,000 per year, medical, retirement.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ashish: My LFW catwalk reflects British diversity,"By Hannah MooreNewsbeat reporter The designer's multicoloured ""midnight market"" theme was inspired by the sequin shops of his home city, Delhi, and featured models of different ethnicities. ""Fashion should represent people in real life,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""When you get on a train you don't just see 6ft tall white girls. You see mixes of all people."" His Sunday night show was set in a clothing stall and mixed 1970s disco with nods to Indian culture. Ashish's signature heavy sequins and slogan jumpers were on display over pussybow blouses and rainbow coloured jumpsuits, with models carrying cheap plastic shopping bags. ""I had the idea of this magical midnight market. It was me going back to my roots, celebrating immigrant communities,"" the designer said backstage. ""I wanted to mix high and low cultures."" Ashish's shows are known for featuring a racially diverse cast of models, and the designer has been outspoken in his support of immigrant communities in the UK. Following the EU referendum, he released a jumper with the word ""Immigrant"", and a t-shirt that said ""Everyone is welcome. Diversity is strength"". This A/W show may not have been as obviously political, but Ashish's message of equality remained. ""I think diversity's really important, and I cast my shows as it is in real life. ""In real life you meet people who speak different languages and come from different places. We're all travellers in a way,"" he said. ""If you're only going to have one type of model on a runway, what message is that sending out to young people? ""It's important to represent different types of people so that everyone has something to aspire to."" London's catwalks are the second most racially diverse in the world, after New York. Figures from the British Fashion Council show 31% of models who walked during fashion week in September were non-white. But the BFC says it wants that figure at closer to 40%, the percentage of black and minority ethnic (BAME) people living in London. Ashish says Instagram has been particularly positive in opening the fashion world up to people from different cultures and classes. ""It's a great way to reach people who wouldn't normally have access to fashion,"" he said. ""To present them with things that would be interesting to them, and to reflect them too.""

Ex-Australian PMs make appeal over Bali Nine drug pair,"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were given the death sentence in 2006 for leading a drug trafficking group known as the Bali Nine. The former prime ministers said they deserved clemency. An Indonesian official has told the BBC that the executions are unlikely to go ahead this month. Tony Spontana, spokesman for Indonesia's attorney general's office, said preparations at the high-security Nusa Kambangan prison, where the executions will be carried out, had taken longer than expected. Earlier, Attorney General H M Prasetyo said their move there was being delayed so that Chan and Sukumaran could spend more time with their families. Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world and ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013. It has insisted the executions will go ahead. 'Human understanding' Malcolm Fraser - who was prime minister from 1975 to 1983 - and all his successors gave their support to Australia's continuing protest against the executions. John Howard said the pair had ""demonstrated genuine rehabilitation"", while Bob Hawke told The Australian newspaper that justice should be based on human understanding. ""These two men made a mistake when they were young and foolish,"" he said. ""They have served their incarceration with model behaviour, and I therefore urge and plead that the government reconsider its decision to now take their lives."" Julia Gillard said: ""I personally would find it heartbreaking if such extraordinary efforts to become of good character were not met with an act of mercy, of recognition of change."" Paul Keating and Kevin Rudd also added their voices to the plea. Australia opposes the death penalty. Six other individuals - from Brazil, France, Ghana, Nigeria, Indonesia and the Philippines - are also being moved to the high-security prison. Who are the Bali Nine? Who are Chan and Sukumaran? 'False hope' The current Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Monday he believed there were still legal options open in the case. Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran have filed a complaint in the administrative court challenging the decision to reject their clemency appeals. ""We have been summoned by the administrative court to appear on 24 February,"" lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis told a press conference. ""This is an evidence that legal process is still ongoing."" But Mr Spontana told the BBC earlier that the court filing did not affect preparations for the executions. ""I can't tell you what will happen if the administrative court says the clemency rejection was flawed. For now as far as we know we have gone through all the legal process to carry out an execution."" Australian media on Monday reported that the men's lawyers had written to the Indonesian judiciary alleging judges had asked for bribes for lighter sentences.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Sir Alan Parker, director of Bugsy Malone and Evita, dies aged 76","The double Oscar nominee's many other credits include Midnight Express, Mississippi Burning, The Commitments, Angela's Ashes and Birdy. Evita composer Andrew Lloyd Webber tweeted Sir Alan had been ""one of the few directors to truly understand musicals on screen"". The director died on Friday after a lengthy illness. He is survived by his wife Lisa Moran-Parker, five children and seven grandchildren. Film producer David Puttnam remembered the director as his ""oldest and closest friend,"" adding: ""I was always in awe of his talent."" A founding member of the Directors Guild of Great Britain, Sir Alan was also first chairman of the UK Film Council and received the CBE in 1995 and a knighthood in 2002. Bafta said it was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Sir Alan's death, adding that his films had ""brought us joy"". The British Film Institute, which Sir Alan chaired in the late 1990s, expressed similar sentiments. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences remembered him as ""a chameleon"" and ""extraordinary talent"" whose work ""entertained us, connected us and gave us such a strong sense of time and place"". Despite not winning an Oscar for best director, his films won 10 Academy Awards as well as another 10 Golden Globes. Actor John Cusack, who worked with Sir Alan on his 1994 comedy The Road to Wellville, said he had been ""a great film-maker"". Born in London in 1944, Sir Alan began his career in advertising as a copywriter but quickly graduated to writing and directing commercials. In 1974 he directed BBC film The Evacuees, winning a Bafta for best single play - the first of seven awards he received from the British Academy. In 1984 Bafta honoured him with the Michael Balcon Award for outstanding contribution to British cinema, and in 2013 he was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship. Satirical observations Sir Alan's last film as director was 2003 drama The Life of David Gale, starring Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet. In 2005 he published Will Write and Direct for Food, a compendium of his often satirical observations on making films in the UK and US. In 2018 he donated his extensive collection of scripts and working papers to the British Film Institute's National Archive.

War Horse musicians lose legal bid,"The musicians took legal action last week following the theatre's decision to end their contribution - of playing live over a pre-recorded soundtrack. They had sought an injunction to be allowed back on the show until a breach of contract case could be heard. However, a judge said he was not persuaded to make an interim order. Mr Justice Cranston added the musicians' prospects at a trial for breach of contract were ""strong"". Neyire Ashworth, Andrew Callard, Jonathan Eddie, David Holt and Colin Rae - who had been with the hit show since 2009 - had their roles cut back in March 2013 to just a few minutes per performance. Their contracts were terminated last month when live, orchestrated music was cut from the production - although it still incorporates live folk songs and choral numbers. The group said they had continued to show up for nightly performances only to be turned away. 'Better than nothing' The musicians' counsel James Laddie QC said: ""The claimants have not accepted this breach of their contracts, and have elected to affirm their contracts. ""They have at all times made it clear that they remain willing and able to attend work and to perform their obligations under their contracts."" ""Even a small walk-on role is better than nothing. It is perhaps an indication of how tough the musical world is that they are happy with that - happy being part of an ensemble, being associated with War Horse and picking up regular wages week in, week out."" The National Theatre said the decision to cut live music from the show was made for artistic and financial reasons. David Reade QC said the theatre was entitled to terminate their contracts as there was no longer an orchestra in the production, saying War Horse was a play that featured music - rather than a musical production. ""The orchestra was not an integral part of the play, and indeed there is no live band in any other production [of War Horse] around the world,"" he said. The Theatre said it welcomed the High Court's decision. ""It is important to emphasise that War Horse has always been, and will continue to be, a play in which music plays an integral part, with a recorded orchestral under-score and central roles for folk musicians who perform live,"" it said in a statement. If the order had been granted, it would have impacted the new cast and creative direction of the show, which has been staged and lit without the presence of musicians since 17 March. War Horse is one of the National Theatre's most successful productions during the tenure of outgoing artistic director Sir Nicholas Hytner, having been seen by more than 2.5 million people worldwide.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Taiwan loses diplomatic ally as Dominican Republic switches ties to China,"Taiwan has said that it is ""deeply upset"" by the Caribbean nation's decision, which deepens its diplomatic isolation. The governments in Beijing and Taipei insist that countries cannot recognise both of them. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Taiwan is now left with only 19 diplomatic allies. The island's foreign ministry said the Dominican Republic had accepted ""false promises of investment and aid by China"". Taipei also ""strongly condemns China's objectionable decision to use dollar diplomacy to convert Taiwan's diplomatic allies"". The Dominican Republic said it believed the switch would be ""extraordinarily positive for the future of our country"" and that it recognised Taiwan as ""an inalienable part of the Chinese territory"". It said that even without formal diplomatic ties, China was already its second largest supplier of imported products. Presidential legal adviser Flavio Dario Espinal told a news conference that the government was grateful to Taiwan. ""However, history and the socioeconomic reality force us now to change direction,"" he explained. The number of countries recognising Taiwan as a state has dwindled in recent years as China's diplomatic influence has strengthened. The last countries before the Dominican Republic to switch allegiance had been Panama last year and the African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe in 2016. Only 19 countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, most of them small island states or in Central and South America - regions that in the past had limited economic ties with China. They are: China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Relations between the two have worsened since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen as president in 2016. Ms Tsai has not formally endorsed the ""one China"" policy - an agreement in 1992 where both sides agreed there was only one China, but had different interpretations of what that meant. Beijing fears she will push for Taiwan's formal independence, but Ms Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo. Since her election, Beijing has intensified its efforts to isolate Taiwan and persuade its supporters to switch sides. Given China's rapid growth as an economic and political global power, it has been increasingly easy for Beijing to sway countries to its side.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third,"More than 2,500 charges were investigated in 2018-19, up from 1,894 the previous year. Alleged ""breach of security"" - which can include bringing contraband into jails - and use of ""unnecessary"" force contributed to the rise. The Prison Service said action was taken against the ""small minority that engaged in inappropriate behaviour"". Mick Pimblett, assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers Association (POA), blamed some of the rises on inexperienced staff and a lack of training. There were 2,511 investigations into alleged misconduct by 1,286 prison staff in England and Wales in 2018-19, according to figures obtained by BBC Radio Kent. Prior to that the number of investigations had been falling. In the same time, 529 staff were disciplined, with 112 recommended for dismissal. Nearly 500 investigations into allegations of ""breach of security"" in prisons took place in the year ending March 2019. The charge covers a ""wide range of disciplinary offences"", which can include anything from leaving an internal gate unlocked to ""conveying unauthorised articles into a prison"", Mr Pimblett said. In the same year there were 169 investigations launched into alleged assaults and unnecessary use of force on prisoners. 'Unreasonable to roll on floor' Mr Pimblett said use of force generally had increased since 2014 ""due to the violent workplace prison officers have to work in"". The Prison Service ""appears reluctant"" to provide personal protective equipment - such as pepper spray - that ""would prevent any accusations of unnecessary force"", he said. ""In this day and age it is unreasonable to expect prison officers to roll around on the floor with prisoners,"" he said. Dave Cook, a member of the POA's executive council who works at a prison in Kent, said the figures did not show how many allegations were proven and represented ""a very small number of corrupt staff, or wrongdoing staff"". Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the rise in investigations may ""provide reassurance that people feel able to speak out, and that when staff are found to have acted inappropriately their misconduct will be formally challenged"". However, he said it was unclear if the rise in allegations was the result of ""declining standards of conduct"" or an increase in people reporting misconduct. The figures cover 105 prisons across England and Wales, excluding the 14 institutions run by private companies. A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said: ""The overwhelming majority of our prison staff are dedicated and honest, but the small minority that engage in inappropriate behaviour are investigated and suitable action is taken. ""Last year, the government announced Â£100m to improve prison security, including increased funding for our counter corruption unit, which roots out the small minority of dishonest staff and the criminals who seek to manipulate them.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Speaking to 250 senior leaders from across the service at the conference in Warwickshire, she said the government had removed the bureaucracy that had previously ""turned police officers into form-fillers rather than crime fighters"". ""It's down to you to decide what crime-fighting policies you're going to follow,"" she said. ""And yet I have noticed that targets have been making a comeback in many forces. ""Those targets certainly aren't coming from me, and they aren't being used to increase the effectiveness of policing. ""Their main function seems to be to act as a security blanket for senior officers - a way to avoid taking responsibility for the decisions they have to make. ""I am not saying that most or even many of you have responded in that way. But some of you have. And none of you should."" 'Model public service' She told the officers it was ""essential"" they had confidence to take responsibility for their own decisions and ""not to try to hide behind an old process or procedure"" which enabled them ""to evade responsibility"". Ms May also had praise for the police, saying the service had ""cut crime with fewer officers and lower budgets"". ""You are doing more with less,"" she said. ""That makes you the model public service in the era of budget cuts."" Earlier, PSAEW president Chief Superintendent Irene Curtis had said that ""front-line policing is being cut to dangerously low levels"". As of March this year, there were 129,584 police officers in England and Wales - which is the lowest level since March 2002, and 12,000 lower than the peak just before the general election in 2010. Ms May said, though, that ""the proportion of officers on the front line has increased from 89% in March 2010 to 91% in March 2013"".

West Midlands submits bid for Channel 4 relocation,"The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) estimates a move could boost the region's economy by Â£5bn over 10 years. A government consultation is considering whether the broadcaster should move out of the capital. Metro mayor Andy Street said Channel 4 would ""thrive"" in the region due to its youthful population, and could create up to 800 jobs. Sites have been proposed in Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull and Dudley. A consultation into the broadcaster's future was launched after the government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly-owned channel, which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside central London. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said ""the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide, not just in London"" although Channel 4 has said a ""substantial relocation would be highly damaging"". Launching his region's bid, Mr Street said: ""The West Midlands, as the youngest, most diverse region, would naturally help in the journey [Channel 4] are already taking."" He described the West Midlands' transport links to London as ""one of our ace cards"" and cited the success of other relocations to the region including HSBC and HS2 headquarters. Mike Bradley, chairman of the Campaign for Regional Broadcasting Midlands, said: ""The West Midlands is the ideal location for Channel 4,"" adding a relocation to the region would ""place Channel 4 right at the heart of its audience."" Elsewhere, two Bradford MPs are calling on the broadcaster to move its HQ to West Yorkshire. Last week, Shipley Conservative MP Philip Davies told the House of Commons how the broadcaster should move to what he called ""gritty"" West Yorkshire. And Keighley Labour MP John Grogan told BBC Radio Leeds about a possible joint Leeds-Bradford bid. He said: ""MPs in West Yorkshire are being asked to back a bid led by Screen Yorkshire, as I understand it, to bring Channel 4 to West Yorkshire. ""It would be a mixture of Leeds and Bradford. There would be, as I understand it, in Leeds, the main Channel 4 building, but also the idea is they also have a training academy and that would come in the plans to Bradford."" The government said it would consider all bids with the broadcaster ""to ensure that Channel 4 maximises its delivery of public value"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Bristol friends raise Â£5,500 after free school meal upset","Chloe and Imogen Wood were shocked to see the lack of food given to families for free school meals packages. In one week they raised Â£3,460 online and more than Â£2,000 offline, filling a dozen trolleys of food that they have delivered to foodbanks in Bristol. Fearnley-Whittingstall said what they have done was ""great"", but added the government should be doing more. Chloe and Imogen, from Southville, along with friends Fiona Riches, Jack Miller, Maia Dixon and Gemma Balding, have already delivered supplies to the North Bristol and East Bristol food banks. Fearnley-Whittingstall, who has joined calls for the Prime Minister to review the government's free school meals policy, has donated Â£100 to their cause. Imogen, 27, a chef who trained and worked with Fearnley-Whittingstall at River Cottage, asked him for his support. She said: ""This opportunity is connecting everyone together, it's classic Bristol that people want to help and I am so proud of our city."" The group have made a few trips to the supermarket to fill up a van with supplies and are working closely with food banks and other charities to ensure they get what is needed. Chloe, 30, said: ""We were so upset by the pictures of the food packages we decided to donate Â£30 each, then we posted on our Instagram accounts to see if anyone else wanted to join us and it just snowballed from there. ""We're so humbled and proud to be able to help, no one should go hungry - our focus is to get people fed."" 'Brilliant project' The friends - some of whom are furloughed from their roles in music, events and hospitality - are now continuing their campaign to reach Â£10,000. Fearnley-Whittingstall added: ""It's great that people like Imogen and Chloe are motivated to set up brilliant projects like @helpfeedBristol to help local people who are struggling to eat well. ""But of course it shouldn't be like this. ""That's why we have been calling for a full review of the Free School Meals policy, and the provision of food to families who are falling below the poverty line in Britain."" The government has now announced that schools can begin ordering free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils, worth Â£15 a week per child, adding to the support available for disadvantaged families. The scheme allows schools to place orders for supermarket gift cards on behalf of parents and carers whose children are eligible for free school meals. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""There should be no doubt in this government's commitment to free school meals support for children who need the most help.""

Ronan Kerr's brother attacks Tom Elliott 'scum' remarks,"Tom Elliott hit out at people waving Irish flags at Omagh Leisure Centre, calling them the ""scum of Sinn Fein"". On his Twitter account, Cathair Kerr said that Mr Elliott's comments were ""prejudiced"". He added: ""People need to move forward. Would his voters still vote for him now?"" Mr Elliott later said that he would ""not forget"" what people in the republican movement had done. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness said Mr Elliott ""needed to reflect on his position"". ""I think we have to respect each other's flags. I thought Tom Elliott demeaned himself, he belittled himself,"" he said. The deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in the Assembly, John McCallister, said he believed Tom Elliot was ""tired"" when he made the comments. ""I wasn't there I wasn't in that setting with the atmosphere that was there,"" he said. ""I haven't the background that Tom has, in that he's served in an area that has suffered horrendously during the Troubles. But it's not a phrase that I would have used."" 'Dalai Lama' The DUP's Gregory Campbell said Mr Elliott's remarks were at odds with his party actions. ""Both Tom and his party were quite content some 12 or 13 years ago to back the Sinn Fein proposition that prisoners should be released and all of the downsides of the Belfast Agreement,"" he said. ""It's a bit late 13 years later to describe the people as scum that he was happy to go along with in terms with the Belfast Agreement."" Former Ulster Unionist MLA David McClarty, who has been returned to the Assembly as an independent, said Tom Elliott's comments were archaic. ""Those comments yesterday certainly were not the progressive type of unionism that I would be promoting,"" he said. ""In fact the comments made Jim Allister sound like the Dalai Lama."" Leader of the Alliance Party, David Ford, also criticised Mr Elliott. ""I honestly wondered if it was the Elliott that was standing for the TUV not the UUP,"" he said. ""That kind of language is clearly outrageous. It's not for me to say what the UUP do, but if they want to stand for the TUV they should stand for the TUV.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
New Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander,"The appointment of Mr Alexander to his second Cabinet post in less than a month marks the next step in his rapid political rise. Virtually unknown outside the Westminster bubble, his profile shot up during the election campaign as Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg's chief of staff. It was during negotiations on the forming of a coalition that the former press officer came into his own - as he relayed the twists and turns of the talks to the waiting news cameras. As the new Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he now faces the daunting task of implementing the new government's deficit reduction plan. Social exclusion The Oxford graduate, 38, already holds an influential position amongst senior Lib Dems. He was Mr Clegg's campaign manager in his successful bid to lead the party in 2007, and they have a close personal and political relationship. Mr Alexander had his own desk within Mr Clegg's office prior to his short-lived appointment to the Scotland Office, and he played a key role in the election campaign. Although outwardly serious, the bespectacled red-head is said to be very funny in private, and able to break tensions with a good joke. The MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey entered the Commons as part of the 2005 intake with a 4,148 majority. The then leader Charles Kennedy instantly made him a member of the work and pensions team, which was followed by a spell as a whip. He later led on social exclusion issues before becoming the party's work and pensions spokesman. He relinquished the role after becoming chief of staff and chairman of the manifesto group. Daniel Grian Alexander gained a BA in politics, philosophy and economics from St Anne's College, Oxford, after attending Lochaber High School in Fort William. He worked as a press officer for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, before becoming head of communications for the European Movement. It was a role he repeated for the Britain in Europe campaign. He was briefly appointed head of communications for the Cairngorms National Park before his election as an MP. His second daughter was born just last week, and he lists his interests as hill-walking, fishing, cricket, golf, reading and travel.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Childcare recruitment 'catastrophe' looms, say campaigners","By Judith BurnsEducation reporter New recruits to key jobs must have at least GCSE C grades in the subjects, with alternative equivalent qualifications no longer accepted. The Save our Early Years campaign says recruitment has already been hit. But the government says numeracy and literacy skills are ""essential"". Staff ratios Under the current rules, staff are only allowed to look after specific numbers of children. Although nurseries are still able to hire staff without good GCSEs, these staff will not count towards the ratios. The rule change applies to people who started training in 2014 or later, who nurseries hope will fill vacancies in the new academic year in September. Save our Early Years fears many will not have managed to achieve good enough GCSE grades, despite completing their childcare qualifications, leading to a shortage of qualified staff. Carol Medcalf, the managing director of an award-winning nursery in north London, who supports the campaign, called the rule ""a huge barrier"". ""I strongly feel, and this is backed up by experience, that the GCSE requirement, especially in maths, is a huge barrier for many wonderful staff entering the profession, and they become unemployable, which is crazy"", said Ms Medcalf who runs Carol Jane Montessori Nursery in Enfield. ""I myself do not have maths GCSE - yet I have run a highly respected, multi-award winning, Ofsted outstanding nursery for over 25 years, and I manage to get the business figures right."" The campaigners say the recruitment crisis will be particularly acute with the government having promised 30 hours of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds from next year. They want the government to reinstate ""Functional Skills"" qualifications as a suitable alternative to GCSE for childcare staff. These qualifications are offered to the 40% of teenagers who do not achieve the benchmark English and maths GCSEs in school and are the equivalent C grades. Julie Hyde, executive director of the childcare qualifications awarding body CACHE, said childcare was the only sector where they were not accepted. ""We simply want a level playing field,"" she said. 'Blocking potential' Liz Bayram, chief executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said feedback from members suggested trainees were being prevented from fulfilling their potential. While Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said he did not believe staff needed GCSEs to demonstrate they were literate and numerate. ""We simply cannot afford to be blocking smart, eager and passionate potential practitioners from joining the sector, just because they don't have the right type of qualification,"" he said. A Department for Education spokesman did not directly address warnings of staff shortages, but said strong numeracy and literacy skills were ""essential"" for staff working with young children. ""That is why we introduced GCSE requirements for those early years staff working for 'level three early years educator' status. ""We are continuing to look at what more can be done to encourage talented staff to forge a career in the early years.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
#ElPasochallenge: Boy responds to shooting to help community heal,"By Rozina SiniBBC News Ruben Martinez is the youngster behind the #elpasoCHALLENGE. He wants people to carry out 22 random acts of kindness, one for each victim killed in Saturday's attack. His mother Rose Gandarillo told the BBC her son came up with the idea after struggling with what happened. ""On the day of the shootings we were driving passed the Walmart and saw all the emergency vehicles. ""Ruben was anxious after seeing that and hearing about what happened. He then asked me if there was a delivery service that could bring us groceries so we wouldn't have to go to the mall again. ""I told him you cannot live in fear and asked him if there was something he wanted to do to help. That's when he came to me with the note about the challenge,"" she said. Rose posted her son's hand-written instructions on how to carry out the challenge on social media. It starts by explaining that the purpose is to ""honour the people who got killed in our city."" Ruben goes on to offer suggestions of the kinds of things people can do such as ""mow someone's lawn, visit a nursing home, pay for someone's lunch or dinner, or comfort someone when they are sad or distressed"". Ruben ends the message with: ""This will show the world that people from El Paso, Texas are kind and care for each other."" On Facebook and Twitter the post has been shared 7,000 times with people not just in El Paso but across the US inspired by Ruben's positive message. ""What a wonderful idea. Thank you for bringing positivity to this world. I will be participating in this challenge in Michigan! Love to El Paso"" posted one Twitter user. Others shared what they would be doing: ""Count me in from California. I'll be knitting pillows and dropping them off at the local shelters and nursing homes."" ""I decided to start picking up litter on my walks. Bringing a bag and gloves. Make your city a little cleaner and safer for the environment,"" read another comment. Chris Castaneda, 20, was eating at a fast food restaurant with his motorcycle club when he learnt about the challenge. ""We had gone as a group to a vigil at a park near to the Walmart where the shootings took place. ""We were about halfway through eating and this little boy came up to our tables and asked if he could talk to us for a second. ""He began telling us how he wants to see El Paso as a better place and have the challenge,"" Chris told the BBC. And he says he has already been inspired by Ruben's message.

NSA workers disciplined over Snowden leaks,"The employee was among three NSA workers sanctioned over the incident, according to an NSA memo. It is said to be the first disciplinary action taken over the breach, which saw Mr Snowden leak details of US electronic surveillance programmes. He has denied stealing any passwords. The 30-year-old is currently in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum after fleeing the US in May last year. He faces espionage charges in the US. 'Even greater access' A letter sent this week by the NSA to the US Congress reveals details of how authorities believe Mr Snowden retrieved so many classified documents before passing them to news organisations. The memo, which was first reported by NBC News, says an unnamed civilian employee told FBI investigators that he allowed Mr Snowden to use an encrypted digital key to log on to the agency's computer network. ""Unbeknownst to the civilian, Mr Snowden was able to capture the password, allowing him even greater access to classified information,"" the memo said. The worker apparently knew that Mr Snowden had been denied access to the system but was not aware that he intended to disclose the data. The NSA worker resigned last month after the government revoked his security clearance and he was told he would lose his job, according to the letter signed by NSA legislative director Ethan L Bauman. A military employee and a private contractor also lost their access to NSA data as part of the continuing investigation, Mr Bauman said. Last month, Mr Snowden denied media reports that he stole or deceived fellow employees to get their log-in information. ""I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers,"" he said. The documents that the former intelligence analyst leaked to journalists shed new light on electronic spying operations by the US and the UK. Among other revelations, the documents showed the NSA collected data on millions of phone calls, collected millions of text messages per day, tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and sought to collect intelligence by spying on users' mobile apps. The US has charged Mr Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10 year prison sentence. In January Mr Snowden said he had ""no chance"" of a fair trial in the US and had no plans to return there.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Government won't be rushed on Swansea tidal on lagoon, says minister","Business minister Lord Henley spoke more than a year after a government-commissioned report backed the scheme. ""A decision will be taken at the appropriate time"", he said. Conservative Lady Finn said it was time to ""cut through the procrastinating"" and go ahead with a project supporters say could power 120,000 homes. Another, Lady Bloomfield, said the decision ""has just been in the long grass for long enough"". Lord Henley said no decisions had been made. ""Work associated with the Hendry review and the proposed Swansea Bay tidal lagoon continues,"" he said. ""The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy remains focused on it. Any decision will have to represent value-for-money for the United Kingdom taxpayer as well as the consumer."" But Tory Lady Finn of Swansea said the Hendry report said the project would cost households less than the equivalent of a pint of milk each year. ] ""It is now time to do what the late, great Lord Crickhowell did with the Cardiff Bay regeneration project - cut through the procrastinating and just get on with it."" The minister told her: ""There are a number of matters to consider, not just those she mentioned, but also the costs, environmental considerations. ""We will take all those into consideration and along with the Welsh Government make an announcement when it is appropriate."" Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Wigley said: ""What on earth is taking so long about such a decision? Isn't it an appalling example for business and everybody else that the government is so slow about this matter. ""Yes, the costs have to be taken into consideration but it's a matter of taking a decision on the basis of the information. Surely we should be getting on with it.""

""What further evidence does the government need?"" Lord Henley told him: ""It's not a question of needing further evidence, it's a matter of considering the evidence that is before us, evidence relating to costs. ""Obviously it would be a very expensive operation, environmental considerations and all other matters.

Manila district police force removed after teen deaths,"Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde said 1,200 officers from the Caloocan district would be retrained and then assigned to other units. The move comes amid growing scrutiny of police operations amid President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drugs war. The most high-profile case involved a boy killed in Caloocan on 16 August. Police say Kian Loyd Delos Santos, who was 17, ran from them and then opened fire, so they shot him. But his parents say he had no involvement in drugs. A witness said police tried to force a gun into his hand and CCTV footage shows a boy, said to be him, being dragged away by police, contradicting claims he ran. A second case involved the death of Carl Arnaiz, a 19-year-old accused of trying to rob a taxi driver. Police said he fired at them but the taxi driver said he saw him alive in police custody. A 14-year-old boy, last seen with Arnaiz, was later found dead. Several policemen are now under investigation and the Senate is currently conducting an inquiry into the teenagers' deaths. Mr Albayalde said the police in Caloocan would be retrained in batches, and all would be temporarily replaced by personnel from a regional security unit. ""They will be retrained and they'll be reassigned to other stations here in Metro Manila. They will not be able to go back to their position or their assignment in Caloocan,"" local media quoted him as saying. Church-bell protest Mr Duterte was elected on a promise to tackle the country's drug problem but his brutal crackdown has been highly controversial. Police figures say 3,800 suspects have been killed in anti-drugs operations since he took office. Several thousand more unexplained killings have also been attributed to the crackdown. But rights groups have voiced serious concerns over extrajudicial killings. Earlier this year, Mr Duterte briefly suspended his crackdown to clean up the police force after officers seized a South Korean businessman under the guise of a drugs raid, killed him and sought a ransom from his family. Many Filipinos support the crackdown. But the recent deaths have generated debate and some protests. On Thursday night, Catholic churches rang their bells for five minutes to mark those who had died and call for the killing to stop. This is to continue for 40 nights. ""We cannot allow the destruction of lives to become normal. We cannot govern the nation by killing,"" Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle said in a statement last week announcing the campaign.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stars stay silent in X Factor protest,"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Madness star Suggs and dance acts Orbital and Pendulum were among those who did nothing in a recording studio. They were recreating composer John Cage's experimental work 4'33"" - the sound of musicians not playing. They hope to emulate Rage Against the Machine, who beat X Factor winner Joe McElderry to number one last year. Dozens of musicians were present and the campaign - dubbed Cage Against the Machine - currently has 62,000 Facebook fans. Guillemots frontman Fyfe Dangerfield, Unkle's James Lavelle, Scroobius Pip and Dan Le Sac also took part in the unconventional session. They were joined by members of The Kooks and Heaven 17 at Dean Street Studios in London. Paul Epworth, who won the Brit Award for best producer this year, was at the controls to record the four-minute, 33-second ""performance"". Xfm DJ Eddy Temple-Morris, who helped organise the event, said: ""You could hear the odd click of a camera shutter or a creak. ""There were people who were seriously into it, like Matty from The Infadels, who had his guitar and was poised to do a massive power chord, but it just never happened. ""There were people swaying, or putting their lighters up in the air, or headbanging and pretending that they could hear some music and really getting into it. ""It was an emotional, unusual, quite beautiful thing to have so many people in a room and be silent."" Pete Doherty was among those previously named on the line-up who did not turn up. According to Mr Temple-Morris, Billy Bragg participated on speaker phone from his tour bus while singer-songwriter Imogen Heap recorded her part earlier in the day. The single will raise money for five charities, including Calm, a service for young men at risk of suicide, and the British Tinnitus Association. Youth Music, Nordoff Robbins music therapy and Sound & Music, a charity promoting challenging new music and sound art, will also benefit from the proceeds. The song is 5/1 to be Christmas number one, according to bookmaker William Hill. But it is still a relative outsider compared with the eventual X Factor winner, who is 4/7 favourite. 'Cruel' spectacle Temple-Morris said 4'33"" was chosen because it was the ""most avant garde piece of music ever made"". He said he objected to The X Factor because he believes it humiliates contestants who do not make the grade. ""It's really cruel, I think, taking people and giving them false hope,"" he said.

Monmouthshire and Newport get 30 new electric car points,"A new scheme will provide free installation to 20 businesses, thanks to funding from the EU, Welsh Government and Monmouthshire council. Ten more will be installed in most Monmouthshire town centre car parks. That means the number in those areas will jump from 21 to 51, according to charge point website ZapMap. In February, calls were made for the Welsh Government to help introduce a network of rapid-charging points for electric cars throughout rural Wales. Mark Lloyd, of Monmouthshire council, told BBC Radio Wales' Country Focus programme the new project will provide 12 months' use of the 3kW charging points for free before businesses decide whether to keep the service for their customers. ""With the government announcement about banning the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040, although it's a long way off, I think you can see the impetus is really growing and there's a lot more take-up of electric vehicles and so there's a lot more demand for charging points."" Mr Lloyd said the Â£20,000 cost of the scheme is 80% funded by European and Welsh Government money, with Monmouthshire council covering the rest. Not-for-profit firm Gwent Energy will install the charge points and monitor them. Phil Powell, from the firm, said most of the new sites would take several hours to fully charge a vehicle and, while there are faster chargers available, their cost can sometimes be prohibitive. ""We've found a range of businesses to try it in different locations so we can learn from it, where they're best suited,"" he added. Jane and Trevor Jones, who run a caravan and camping site near Caerleon, Newport, are among the business owners benefitting. ""I think it will increase our numbers - it's surprising how many people come to this area. The electric cars that do turn up tend to be from the south east of England and they're desperate to find a hook up point,"" Mr Jones said. Lynne Colston and her partner Steve Smith, who live near Brecon, in Powys, lease an electric car for about Â£300 per month. They said it provided good value compared to their previous vehicle, but they do have to plan their journeys more carefully as the car only has a 120-mile (193km) range. Mr Smith said: ""Longer journeys you do keep looking at the range, it does maybe affect how you drive - it calms you down a bit to try to get more miles out of it.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers","Thursday evening's opening episode on BBC One attracted an average of 5.5 million viewers, a 26.3% share of the available viewing audience. The launch of last year's series attracted an average of 6.4 million. The show, which sees Lord Sugar hunt for a new business idea to invest in, has moved from Wednesday to Thursday nights this year. It was still the evening's most-watched programme, narrowly beating Emmerdale on ITV, which attracted 5.4 million to the first of its two Thursday evening episodes. The figures are for the number of viewers watching the programme live and do not take into account those watching via catch-up services after broadcast.

It also beat 4.5 million viewers who watched the 2007 series launch - the first time the show was broadcast on BBC One. The highest rating opening episode in the show's history was in 2009, when an average of 8.1 million viewers watched the fifth series begin. 'Processed entertainment' The episode received negative reviews from many critics. Christopher Stevens gave the episode one star in his review for The Daily Mail. ""This isn't real television, it's processed entertainment churned out by soulless production machinery, all empty calories and pap,"" he wrote. The Guardian's Sam Wollaston said: ""I know it still does very well, because it is still undeniably entertaining, but that doesn't mean it's still interesting.""

Jlloyd Samuel death: Footballer's body 'too burnt' for visual ID,"Warrington Coroner's Court heard Samuel died when his Range Rover crashed with another vehicle in Cheshire last May, but the crash was not suspicious. Coroner Alan Moore concluded he died as a result of road traffic collision. His sister pledged to seek her own DNA test amid claims his death was faked. The Sun on Sunday reported allegations by Leslie-Ann Samuel that her brother was not at the wheel when the crash happened in West Lane, High Legh, and he was still alive. 'Clear as we can be' Dr John Sellar, a forensic odontologist, told the court he was satisfied teeth from the body matched Samuel's dental records. Describing how visual identification was not possible as the body had been ""extensively burnt"", he said: ""People who know the victim would not have wished to have seen those images."" Forensic biologist Alexandra Clark said a blood sample taken from the body matched that of cellular material taken from the footballer's hairbrush and clippers. She said tests on a hairbrush were ""a billion times more likely"" to be the footballer than of someone else who used it. ""This is as clear as we can be,"" she said. Det Ch Insp Paul Beauchamp of Cheshire Police said he looked into the potential for foul play or kidnapping but found no evidence of either. Insp Liz Cunningham, also from Cheshire Police, who was called to the crash, told the court she was satisfied by the dental evidence and accounts of passers-by that the deceased was Samuel. ""It was nothing more complicated than a collision,"" she said. Missing arm claim After the coroner ruled it was the footballer's body, Ms Samuel interrupted him and said she had been denied the chance to privately test DNA taken from the body. Mr Moore said the footballer's samples belonged to his next of kin, his wife Emma, and he can only release them with her permission. Ms Samuel replied saying she would apply for a court order and she also said the body's right arm was missing. Pathologist Dr Jonathan Medcalf responded, saying: ""That was not how the body was left and we have photographs to prove it."" Samuel made 199 appearances for Villa after signing for the club in 1998 and played 83 times for Bolton between 2007 and 2011. He won two caps for Trinidad and Tobago.

She was working as a maid for a family travelling on the ship when it sank. The document will go under the hammer at Henry Aldridge and Son auctioneers in Devizes, Wiltshire, on 18 October. Items on the menu, which is dated 12 April, included mutton chops, Melton Mowbray pie and tapioca pudding. Deck plan A deck plan used by French-born Ms Lurette to help find her way to a lifeboat on the ill-fated ship, which sank on its maiden voyage, killing about 1,500 people, is also included in the sale. The plan was given only to first-class passengers and Ms Lurette wrote on it 'Depart le 10 Avril' and marked it with a cross to indicate the location of her cabin. It is expected to sell for Â£16,000. Ms Lurette kept the documents and left them to her family when she died the year after the disaster aged 60. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: ""To have a menu, especially one from lunch on 12 April that survived the sinking in Ms Lurette's coat pocket, alongside a first-class deck plan, which was used on the Titanic and has remained in the family for over a century, is unheard of. ""Elise was rescued in lifeboat number six and was severely traumatised by her experiences, recalling the screams of those in the water and their attempts to climb into the lifeboat."" Also being sold is a postcard Ms Lurette sent to her nephew from the Titanic when it stopped off at Queenstown in Ireland, which is expected to sell for Â£6,000. And a letter written by the Titanic's chief engineer, Joseph Bell, to his son, which describes a near-miss the ship had as it left Southampton, is estimated to fetch between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000. In March 2012, a menu of the last meal served to first class passengers on board the Titanic sold for Â£76,000 by the same auctioneers. In November the same year, a first class lunch menu from the Titanic sold for Â£64,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Shetland Super Puma crash: Co-pilot's actions 'crucial' to survival,"Super Puma passengers Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, died in 2013. A total of 18 people were on board. A crash investigator said the co-pilot managed to arm the flotation bags just before the helicopter hit the sea. Adrian Cope, senior inspector of engineering with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), told the fourth day of the FAI he travelled to the scene the day after the crash. The inquiry has heard the helicopter struck the water, with little warning to allow anyone to react, overturned and quickly filled with water. 'Kept helicopter afloat' Mr Cope said of crew member Alan Bell's actions: ""The co-pilot realised what was going to happen and armed the flotation bags"". He described his ""awareness and quick-thinking"" as ""crucial"" as that kept the helicopter afloat rather than it possibly sinking. Mr Cope said the crash was classed as survivable, so it was important to try to understand why people did not. The inquiry heard no evidence was found of any issue with the helicopter which had caused or contributed to the crash. Mr Cope said the gearbox was one of the first things they looked into, and no fault was found. AAIB colleague Mark Ford, a senior inspector of air accidents specialising in flight data, also gave evidence. He said analysis indicated there was quite a bit of variation in the way pilots would make their descents. Mr Ford said the pilot in question, at 1,000ft, was at the correct speed in terms of operator guidelines. Six-second warning He said the aircraft was not fitted with a helicopter terrain awareness warning system, which was not a requirement. Asked by Martin Richardson for the Crown if it would have been effective, he said tests indicated a warning would have been issued less than six seconds before the helicopter hit the sea, which it was believed would have come too late to prevent the accident. Sarah Darnley, Duncan Munro and George Allison drowned. Gary McCrossan, who had cardiac disease, died from heart failure following the crash. The inquiry has also heard that one survivor, Samuel Bull, who was believed to be 28, later took his own life after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. The inquiry, which was previously delayed due to coronavirus measures, continues before Derek Pyle, Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care,"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Nearly 1.85 million requests for support were made last year, but just over 650,000 people received help. Councils have been warning for a number of years that a shortage of funding is causing problems. But the Health and Social Care Information Centre figures shows how difficult it is for people to get help. Only 144,000 of the requests for help resulted in long-term care, which includes places in care homes or help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing. Nearly 220,000 got short-term help, such as rehabilitation after discharge from hospital, and another 300,000 got low-level support such as walking aids and telecare. The rest either received nothing or were advised to seek help from charities, the NHS or from housing services. Unlike the NHS, social care is not free and most people will pay something towards the cost of their care, with some covering the entire cost. 'Alarming picture' Meanwhile, a separate survey of nearly 70,000 people who did get help revealed their experiences of care. Some 65% said they were extremely or very satisfied with their care and 26% were quite satisfied, but one in 10 was not. One in 20 did not feel clean or presentable and the same proportion said they did not always get enough food and drink. The care system Find out more Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said the figures painted an ""alarming picture of services cut back to the bare bones"". ""This is a direct result of Â£4.6bn cuts to social care budgets since 2010 and comes despite an ageing population which is increasing the need for these services,"" she added. The figures come after a coalition of health and care groups wrote to the Treasury last month warning that the care sector needed to be protected as the ""deepening crisis"" was putting people in danger. The government said its spending plans would be revealed in November, but pointed out that a Â£5.4bn fund - the Better Care Fund - had been established in April to ensure NHS money was used for services that support council-organised care. But Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ""We need to see a change to the current perverse funding system which, over the last five years, has seen an increase in funding for the NHS but a decrease in funding for social care. ""This threatens to leave councils struggling to commission the essential support which keeps people out of hospital and living healthier and happier lives in their communities.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Japan frees Chinese boat captain amid diplomatic row,"Japan had accused Zhan Qixiong of deliberately ramming two patrol vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. China said his detention was ""illegal and invalid"", and cut off ministerial-level contacts with Japan. The release came after four Japanese were detained in China on suspicion of illegally filming in a military area. A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman said its embassy in Beijing had received confirmation that the four were being held, but he said he did not want to speculate whether it was linked to Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain. Officials said the four men were employees of a Japanese construction company who were in China to bid for a project to dispose of chemical weapons from World War II. Escalating tensions At a news conference, prosecutors in Naha, Okinawa, said Mr Zhan was just a fishing boat captain and had no criminal record in Japan. They said they did not perceive any premeditated intent to damage the patrol boats and therefore had decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on relations with China. ""It is a fact that there was the possibility that Japan-China relations might worsen or that there were signs of that happening,"" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku, the Reuters news agency reported. ""Our ties are important and both sides must work to enhance our strategic and mutual beneficial relations."" Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said on the Chinese foreign ministry website that the government was sending a charter plane to bring Mr Zhan home, reiterating that ""any form of so-called legal procedures taken by Japan against the Chinese boat captain are illegal and invalid"". Tensions had escalated since Japan detained the Chinese captain. Beijing cut off ministerial-level contacts between the two countries and thousands of Chinese tourists pulled out of trips to Japan. Concerts by a Japan's top boy band SMAP due to take place in Shanghai were cancelled by the Chinese organisers. Earlier this week Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that Japan bore full responsibility for the situation and demanded the immediate release of the captain. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the two sides to settle the issue before it had a long-term impact on the region. The Japanese coastguard arrested Zhan Qixiong on 8 September after his trawler collided with two of their patrol boats in an area claimed by both countries, near uninhabited islands which may have oil and gas deposits Japanese prosecutors had until next Wednesday to decide whether or not to charge the man.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Solar Impulse aeroplane reaches Ohio,"The zero-fuel aircraft arrived in Dayton at 21:56 local time (01:56 GMT) having flown from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 1,113km journey took pilot Andre Borschberg about 16 hours to complete, a relatively short hop for the plane. Solar Impulse is aiming to get to New York in the next couple of weeks before it crosses the Atlantic - the last big leg in its global endeavour. To complete the circumnavigation, the aeroplane needs to get to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates where the journey started in March last year. As well as setting new aviation milestones, the stated purpose of the project is to demonstrate the capability of clean technologies. The plane gets all its energy from the sun, captured by 17,000 photovoltaic cells on its top surfaces. These power the craft's propellers during the day but also charge batteries that the vehicle's motors can then call on during the night. The craft is wider than a 747 jumbo jet but weighs just 2.3 tonnes. Low flight speed means mission legs can take several days and nights of continuous flight. The pilot is permitted only catnaps of up to 20 minutes, and the cockpit is little bigger than a public telephone box. LEG 1: 9 March.

Virgin's Unity plane rockets skyward,"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent Chief pilot, Scotsman Dave Mackay, and co-pilot, American Mike Masucci, took the vehicle to almost 90km in altitude above California's Mojave Desert before gliding back down to Earth. The test flight edges Virgin that bit closer to its goal of introducing commercial passenger flights. More than 700 people are signed up for a trip on Unity to suborbital space. It's not clear when precisely this service will begin, but Virgin Group boss, Sir Richard Branson, believes it will be very soon. Mr Mackay, from Helmsdale, Sutherland, becomes the first Scottish-born pilot to travel to space, by Virgin's preferred definition of that term. ""It was thrilling yet smooth and nicely controlled throughout, with a view at the top, of the Earth from space, which exceeded all our expectations,"" he said after landing back at Mojave airport. Friday's mission followed the usual flight procedures. Unity was carried aloft by the WhiteKnightTwo aircraft, before being released to ignite its rocket motor and climb high over the desert. It's only the fifth time Unity has conducted a powered ascent, and should have provided valuable data on engine performance and the overall handling of the vehicle. The big difference with previous flights is that there was a third person onboard. Beth Moses is Virgin's chief astronaut instructor and she was present on the mission to get a better understanding ""of the customer cabin and spaceflight environment from the perspective of people in the back"". Unofficial data indicates Unity climbed to a maximum altitude of 89.9km (55.85 miles; 294,9007ft), travelling at Mach 3 (three times the speed of sound) on the way up. In December, Unity reached an altitude of 82.7km (271,330ft), which was enough for the pilots on that occasion - Mark Stucky and CJ Sturckow - to earn commercial astronaut wings from the US Federal Aviation Authority. Mackay, Masucci and Moses should now receive the same honour. Sir Richard commented: ""I am immensely proud of everyone involved. Having Beth fly in the cabin today, starting to ensure that our customer journey is as flawless as the spaceship itself, brings a huge sense of anticipation and excitement to all of us here who are looking forward to experiencing space for ourselves. The next few months promise to be the most thrilling yet."" Sir Richard's Virgin Galactic company is vying with Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin outfit to be the first to introduce a sub-orbital passenger spaceflight service. Mr Bezos is pursuing a different technological route. He has a booster and capsule system that goes straight up from a launch pad in West Texas. The two components separate at altitude before then both making their way back to Earth under control. The Amazon entrepreneur's New Shepard system regularly flies over 100km - the height most widely recognised as the lower boundary of space (although there is currently a lively scientific debate over whether this is the best classification).

Mobile mast size rules relaxed for better coverage across Wales,"Masts of up to 25m will no longer need to go through the full planning permission process from April. This has been in place in England and Scotland since 2016, leading to claims that the Welsh Government was dragging its feet. The process for approving electric vehicle charging points is also set to be accelerated by planning changes. The changes, under what are known as permitted development rights, replace the existing limit of 15m and bring Wales in line with the rest of Britain. Because they can carry more equipment and send the signal further, it is hoped bigger masts will benefit places with limited or no mobile coverage. Telecoms companies have been calling for the changes, which were recommended by a government-commissioned report in 2017. The assembly's economy committee said last month that Wales risked falling behind when the next generation of mobile phone technology, such as 5G, arrives. Committee chairman Russell George said he was ""pleased that the Welsh Government has finally proposed this change after many years of refusing this request"". ""It is critical that Wales is not left behind in this new era and there are still parts of Wales with no connection at all,"" he said. ""That simply isn't good enough and it is crucial that these not-spots are covered, particularly in remote, rural areas."" Avoiding the need for full planning permission could save companies Â£2,250 and cut eight weeks off the process, the Welsh Government said. Deputy Economy Minister Lee Waters said: ""The purpose of changing permitted development rights to allow taller masts is to enable the further roll-out of mobile coverage across Wales, particularly in those areas with limited or no coverage currently. ""We must remember that the main levers to improve mobile coverage lie with the industry, Ofcom and UK Government. ""They are not devolved but we are taking action in the areas we are responsible for."" The new permitted development rights for electric car charging points include potential locations at the kerbside, at homes and supermarkets. It is meant to help create a ""Wales-wide network of charging infrastructure"", according to the Welsh Government. Building work to install broadband and put solar panels on roofs will also be made easier under the changes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Steve Easterbrook's new McJob,"By Jamie RobertsonPresenter, BBC World News The former Watford Grammar School boy is seen as the man who revitalised the group's UK business. And McDonald's needs a turnaround specialist as it struggles with its image, assailed by meat scandals in Asia, low-wage protests, legal cases over racism and tough fast food competition and falling profits. Easterbrook confronted the UK operation's somewhat battered reputation head-on back in 2006, even launching a petition to change the dictionary definition of the term McJob as a dead-end job. The definition has not changed, even though a McDonald's survey claimed most people now feel it is unfair. Fierce debate He took on Eric Schlosser, author of the bestselling Fast Food Nation, in a fierce debate on the BBC's Newsnight, and then set up a website to answer questions ranging from working conditions to animal welfare, as well as more curious enquiries such as ""is there any pork in your gherkins?"" At the time he told journalists: ""We wanted to send a signal of a step change in the way that we were going to be seen as a business. We were a faceless business, we were seen as being difficult to get to, and introspective."" He took a canny approach to the criticism over the firm's environmental conduct, by campaigning for the Prince's Rainforest Project. McDonald's was also one of the companies involved in the Amazon Soy Moratorium, banning soy grown on cleared forestland in the Brazilian Amazon. Within 10 months of taking over the UK business he was made president of McDonald's Northern Europe. Surprise change Then in 2011, to everyone's surprise, he left the group and went for a brief spell as chief executive of Pizza Express and then to the Japanese-inspired restaurant chain Wagamama, before coming back to McDonald's as its chief brand and strategy officer in 2013. He is married with three children and lives in Illinois in the US, and on his Twitter profile describes himself as a Brit, a father and a fan of Watford Football Club. Apart from those 18 months away, he's a fully paid-up member of what is sometimes called the ""McFamily"". He joined the UK finance department of McDonald's back in 1993, after reading natural sciences at Durham University and training as an accountant at PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC). He has worked at the sharp end (running restaurants), done the education (18 months at the company's own Hamburger University near Chicago) and worked his way through senior management. So he has credibility within the ""McFamily"". But while he has an accountancy training, his talent lies in branding and marketing. That is why he's been chosen for the top job at a company whose image is under fire more than ever.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Church of England to keep Amazon shares despite Welby criticism,"The Church Times has revealed Amazon was among the 20 biggest global investments by the Church last year. A statement from the CofE said it considered the most effective way to seek change was to be ""in the room with these companies"" as a shareholder. Amazon has repeatedly said it pays all taxes required in the UK. Archbishop Justin Welby, in a speech to the Trades Union Congress on Wednesday, said: ""When vast companies like Amazon and other online traders, the new industries, can get away with paying almost nothing in tax, there is something wrong with the tax system. ""They don't pay a real living wage, so the taxpayer must support their workers with benefits. ""And having leeched off the taxpayer once they don't pay for our defence, for security, for stability, for justice, health, equality, education."" His comments came a week after he told the BBC there needed to be a fundamental rethink of how the economy works, including higher taxes on technology giants and the wealthy. The 2017 annual report from the Church Commissioners, which deals with the Church's investments, revealed Amazon Inc was one of its top 20 global equity investments. A statement from the Church said: ""We consider aggressive tax avoidance or abusive tax arrangements to be both a business risk and an ethical issue. ""As with other issues, we take the view that it is most effective to be in the room with these companies seeking change as a shareholder. ""We continue to work with other shareholders to tackle this issue via engagement with companies and their managers."" The Church made a return of 18.6% on global equities in 2017. In 2014, the commissioners sold around Â£75,000 of shares in the payday lender Wonga after the archbishop pledged to ""put it out of business"". He had admitted to being ""embarrassed"" and ""irritated"" when details of the link emerged in 2013. Last week, Amazon briefly became the second US-listed firm to have a market value of more than $1 trillion (Â£779bn). Archbishop Welby has also attracted criticism regarding comments he made about zero-hour contracts which he called the ""reincarnation of an ancient evil"". In a letter to the Times, the Reverend Ray Anglesea, a minister who worked on a zero-hours contract in a cathedral bookshop, said: ""What the Most Rev Justin Welby did not disclose was how many of his cathedrals are zero contract hour employers and how many cathedral employees have no job certainty, no sick or holiday pay, and no maternity cover."" The Church of England said advice to its parishes on zero-hours contracts was issued in 2013, and ""does not reflect the current thinking"" of the Church.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK unemployment rises to 1.7m,"That is the first increase since the May-July period of last year. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1%, which is still down on the same time last year, when it was 5.6%. Earnings, including bonuses rose by 1.8% in the three months to February, which is a slowdown from the 2.1% rate for the previous three-month period. ""It's too soon to be certain, but with unemployment up for the first time since mid-2015 - and employment seeing its slowest rise since that period - it's possible that recent improvements in the labour market may be easing off,"" ONS statistician Nick Palmer said. There were 31.41 million people in work in the three months , a rise of 20,000 on the September to November period. Delayed hiring? Some economists believe uncertainty linked to the 23 June referendum on EU membership could be deterring companies from taking on new staff. ""Last week the Bank of England said that concerns about the EU referendum had begun to affect the real economy,"" said Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The increase in unemployment announced today adds some weight to that hypothesis. It's possible businesses are delaying decisions about hiring and investment until after June's vote, which could lead to a slowdown in the first two quarters of this year. ""Nevertheless, the bigger picture is that the UK labour market remains in reasonable health,"" he added. The increase in unemployment was too low to change the rate when expressed to one decimal place, which stayed at a decade low of 5.1%. Public sector falling The figures also show that there were 5.35 million people employed in the public sector for December 2015. This was scarcely change compared with September 2015 but it was down 50,000 from a year earlier. The ONS said the number of people employed in the public sector has been generally falling since March 2010. In the private sector there were 26.07 million people employed for December 2015 - that is 113,000 more than for September 2015 and 529,000 more than for a year earlier. In the October to December 2015 period the number of UK nationals working in the UK increased by 278,000 to 28.2 million compared with the same time in 2014. At the same time the number of non-UK nationals working in the UK increased by 254,000 to 3.22 million.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Speeding drink-driver killed man in Aberdeen bus stop crash,"Martin Henderson, 30, fled the scene after the crash which left father-of-three Allan Forbes, 70, dead last year. An 18-year-old woman who was also standing at the bus shelter in the Bucksburn area of the city was left seriously injured. Lord Mulholland told repeat offender Henderson, from Inverurie, it had been an ""appalling"" incident. The judge deferred sentencing until 30 June and remanded Henderson in custody. Relatives of Mr Forbes said they were glad justice had been done. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that retired bus driver Mr Forbes - who had been married for 47 years - was waiting on a bus to meet up with his youngest son when he was struck by Henderson's BMW 320 estate on 9 November. After the crash, Henderson drank more alcohol before contacting police and claiming his car had been stolen. Advocate depute Graeme Jessop said Henderson had met a work colleague and was seen drinking on the day of the crash. He drank two-and-a-half pints of lager and ate a meal before setting off on the 10-mile trip towards Bucksburn. At one stage on the journey he was seen travelling at 97mph in a 40mph zone. Just before the fatal collision he was estimated to be travelling at 67mph in a 30mph zone. Mr Jessop said: ""The collision investigators were of the opinion that the accused's impairment through consuming alcohol and the excessive speed at which he was driving the vehicle combined to cause him to lose control on the bend at the collision scene."" Henderson hit a pavement and ploughed into the bus shelter, hitting the two pedestrians who were waiting there. 'You should be ashamed' Mr Jessop said Mr Forbes suffered ""catastrophic unsurvivable injuries"" and was pronounced dead at the scene. Chloe Donaldson, 18, suffered a broken leg and nose and chipped teeth. The fracture to her left leg required surgery to insert a metal plate and pins. The driver and his two passengers escaped without physical injury. Lord Mulholland said: ""You have taken a life and given that poor family a life sentence. ""You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself."" 'Focus on healing' Defence counsel Neil Shand told the court: ""The accused recognises that a custodial sentence is entirely inevitable and indeed deserved."" The court heard Mr Forbes' family and Ms Donaldson had wanted to attend court but decided not to with reluctance after being strongly advised not to due to coronavirus. A Forbes family statement, released through Digby Brown Solicitors, said: ""The loss of Allan has devastated us and it has left a huge gap in our family that will never be filled. ""We are glad justice has been done and it means our family can focus on healing. ""Finally, we'd like to thank our loved ones, friends and those in the community who have supported us.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Manchester Arena Inquiry: Area where Abedi hid 'not our domain',"Showsec supervisor David Middleton said he had never been instructed to check the mezzanine area. ""We were to keep the steps clear but above the steps was not our domain,"" he said. Abedi hid for nearly an hour before going downstairs to detonate the bomb. Twenty-two people were killed and many more injured when as they left the Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. 'Not our area' The inquiry was shown a sheet used by Mr Middleton to log security checks made before the crowd left at the end of shows, marked ""entire City Room area"". Mr Middleton, who has worked for Showsec since 1996, said the mezzanine was ""not our area, that was my understanding"", because the company at the top of the stairs, JD Williams, and formerly McDonalds, had their own security staff. He said he ""cannot recollect ever being told to check the mezzanine area"" and he did not see any other colleagues ever doing it. Mr Middleton said looking out for suspicious characters was part of the process, but added: ""In areas defined to be our area."" The inquiry heard Mr Middleton worked at thousands of events at the arena and was a supervisor on the night of the bombing, with 13 stewards reporting to him. He said anyone who appeared to be ""passing through"" the City Room rather than trying to enter the concert venue would not have been considered suspicious, regardless of their appearance. Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: ""We've got a lone male who doesn't fit the audience demographic with a large backpack on his back who is on the mezzanine level for prolonged periods of time. Do you think that he was a suspicious individual?"" Mr Middleton replied: ""Very hard to say . . . he could be somebody waiting for his younger sister to come out of the concert, it can be anything. ""If he'd have approached the doors yes, but if he's not approaching the doors, no."" The inquiry has heard a couple waiting to pick up their daughter reported concerns to another steward about a man matching Abedi's description acting suspiciously on the mezzanine floor about 15 minutes before the blast. The steward, who was instructed not to leave his position at an emergency exit, claims he tried to get Mr Middleton's attention on three occasions. Mr Middleton said he was standing up to 20 metres away but no-one raised any suspicions with him and he did not hear his colleague shouting over. The inquiry continues.

Sturgeon wants Indyref2 in 'second half of 2020',"Speaking in Dublin Ms Sturgeon said the ""latter half"" of next year would be the ""right time"" for a new poll. The SNP leader predicted victory in a second vote, with Scotland becoming ""an independent country just like Ireland"". Ms Sturgeon also confirmed legislation setting out the rules for another independence referendum will be published at Holyrood on Wednesday. The first minister, who met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during her Irish trip, had previously said she wanted to hold a second vote on Scottish independence by May 2021 if the country was taken out of the EU. 'Right time' Speaking after her party secured 37.7% of the Scottish vote in the European elections she gave a clearer indication of her preferred timeframe. Ms Sturgeon said: ""There will be another Scottish independence referendum and I will make a prediction today that Scotland will vote for independence and we will become an independent country just like Ireland, and the strong relationship between our two countries now will become even stronger soon. ""I want to see Scotland having the choice of independence within this term of the Scottish Parliament, which ends in May 2021, so towards the latter half of next year would be when I think is the right time for that choice."" In a separate BBC interview, Ms Sturgeon said she would bring forward legislation later this week at Holyrood paving the way for a second independence vote. She said: ""This week we will bring forward legislation to put in place the rules for giving people the choice in an independence referendum over a Brexit future or a future as an independent European nation."" Ms Sturgeon has previously said that in order to put a future Yes vote beyond doubt or challenge, she would want the UK government to give Holyrood the power to hold a new referendum through a ""Section 30 order"" or similar mechanism. The UK government has insisted it would not support such a vote at the present time, arguing that the matter was supposed to be ""settled for a generation"" by the independence referendum in 2014. The Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden criticised the first minister's comments on independence, accusing her of ""hypocritical deceit"". He said: ""The SNP went into this election pretending to voters that it was nothing to do with independence. ""Yet within hours of it being announced, Nicola Sturgeon is specifically using it to argue for separation. ""That's fraudulent behaviour from an SNP government that's meant to be running the country, not trying to break it up.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Iraq Inquiry: PM urged to 'pull plug' on report,"Lord Morris told peers the panel led by Sir John Chilcot seemed ""incapable"" of delivering its report into the 2003 conflict and should be discharged. The prime minister has said he is ""fast losing patience"" with the time taken to complete the inquiry, begun in 2009. But Sir John has said it would be unrealistic to set a deadline. The inquiry is looking into the background to the UK's controversial participation in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, which toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, and its aftermath. MPs and peers have become increasingly exasperated at continued delays to the report, with some arguing that the inquiry should be compelled to publish its findings now, even if they are incomplete. 'Long time' Labour peer Lord Morris, who was attorney general between 1997 and 1999, said Parliament should take control of the process. ""Since Parliament is the ultimate guardian of the independence of any inquiry, and since this one seems incapable of reporting, should not the prime minister pull the plug, discharge the committee and on the basis of the evidence already gathered come to Parliament for its advice for the way forward?"" he said. In a short debate in the Lords, former Defence Secretary Lord King said the time taken meant the inquiry would not be able to fulfil its central purpose of advising on lessons learned in order to prevent similar mistakes happening in the future. He told peers that time limits should be placed on future public inquiries. Other peers, including Baroness Williams and Lord Trimble, also called for changes to the constitution of future inquiries. to give politicians more say over their timetable. Independent In his most recent update, Sir John said progress had been made but the ""Maxwellisation"" process - in which those likely to be criticised in the report are given a right to reply - had yet to be completed, as some unnamed individuals had yet to respond. Sir John has acknowledged the frustrations of those waiting for the report, particularly the families of the 179 service personnel killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009, but said it would be counter-productive to give a firm date for its completion. He has said he believes no-one is deliberately trying to delay the inquiry or limit what can be published. Cabinet Office Minister Lord Bridges of Headley said he disagreed that the inquiry should be scrapped but noted that the Prime Minister, David Cameron, had impressed upon the panel the need for urgency in completing its work. ""The inquiry is independent of government and, most importantly of all, it has taken a long time to get this far, and it needs to be able to complete its work as quickly as possible so we can learn the lessons,"" he said. ""Removing them from office or stopping this now is not in the best interests of this work.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Why are young Indians killing themselves?,"Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent If new research is to be believed, a disturbingly high number of young Indians are losing the courage. A study published in the medical journal The Lancet shows that suicide has become the second leading cause of death among the country's young adults, after road accidents in men, and childbirth-related complications in women. There were 187,000 deaths from suicides in India in 2010, the study says - this is higher than the official figure of 134,599 suicide deaths from the National Crime Records Bureau. (Researchers attribute this gap to under-reporting or misreporting as friendly or bribe-seeking coroners often sign off suicide deaths as ones caused by accidents to protect the victim's family from police harassment and social stigma.) If the findings by a team of doctors are to be believed, 40% of the men and 56% of the women who took their lives in 2010 were aged between 15 and 29 years. The suicide rate in Indian women aged 15 years or older is more than two and a half times greater than it is in women of the same age in high-income countries, and nearly as high in China. The corresponding rate in men in the same group is between one to two times greater in men of the same age in high-income countries. I asked Dr Vikram Patel, a leading Goa-based psychiatrist and professor at the London School Of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who co-authored the study, about why he thought this was happening. He believes that joblessness for men and post-marriage problems for women trigger off a lot of these suicides. ""In women it manifests in depression, in men it becomes a drinking problem,"" he says. India is a society steeped in the patriarchal tradition, where most women are still expected to stay at home, and bring up children. But more and more women are stepping out to work and aspiring to be independent and successful. But pressures of family, demands for dowry and domestic harassment - and violence - push many such young, married women over the edge in the country's teeming cities and towns. ""This is what I call the aspirational reality gap,"" says Dr Patel. ""Exposure to global media, education doesn't match up to the realities at home. A touch of anomie worsens matters. Suicide is seen as a potential way out of it."" Perhaps not surprising in a society which lives with one foot in tradition, and the other in modernity.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bulgarian writer wins BBC Short Story Award,"The winner was announced at a ceremony in London, broadcast live on Radio 4 arts show Front Row. Penkov takes the Â£15,000 prize, while the runner-up, South African writer Henrietta Rose-Innes, wins Â£2,500 for her story Sanctuary. The BBC competition was opened out this year to include international writers, in honour of the London 2012 Games. The shortlist included stories from Deborah Levy, also shortlisted for this year's Man Booker prize; former winner Julian Gough; and Krys Lee, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, but brought up in the US. The judges said they were ""unanimous"" in their selection of Penkov's story, which is set during and after the Cold War in Bulgaria. According to organisers, East of the West ""explores the difficulties of love, relationships and identity in a region ridden with conflict"". ""I wanted to write a story about those Bulgarians who... were severed from our country, and who inevitably will lose, if they haven't already, their sense of being Bulgarian,"" said Penkov. ""At the same time, I wanted to write a story about myself, abroad in America and in many ways alone, with a huge body of water between me and the people I love."" 'Unforgettable narrator' Broadcaster Clive Anderson chaired this year's judging panel, which featured Di Speirs, editor of readings for BBC Radio, and novelist Ross Raisin, a fan of the story's ""understatedness"". Fellow judge, novelist and professor of creative writing Michele Roberts, said it ""ambitiously and successfully united personal and political life"". Ten stories were selected for this year's shortlist, instead of the usual five, to help reflect the wide range of entries from around the globe. Each story has been broadcast on Radio 4 over the past fortnight, read by such leading British actors as Rory Kinnear and Sherlock's Andrew Scott. ""This year the BBC Short Story Award has gone global,"" said Radio 4 controller Gwyneth Williams. ""We have stories from Australia, America, the Balkans, Ireland, the UK and the land of my birth, South Africa."" Williams continued: ""Storytelling lies at the heart of Radio 4 and I am proud to say that we broadcast more stories each year than anyone, anywhere in the world.""

"Volkswagen's UK sales fell in October, says SMMT","The motor group has been embroiled in controversy over the level of emissions from its diesel and petrol cars. Sales of VW branded cars fell 9.8%, Skoda dropped 3% and Seat sales sank 32.2%. However, sales of Audi, Porsche and Bentley cars all rose. Overall, UK car sales in October fell by 1.1%, the industry body said. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said October's decline followed a record 43 consecutive months of growth. The VW brand sold 13,970 cars in October, down from 15,495 in the same month last year. Of the Volkswagen Group brands that SMMT collects figures for, sales fell overall by about 6%. However, Volkswagen was by no means the only carmaker to see sales fall on October. New car registrations for Vauxhall dropped 16%, and Ford's sales fell by nearly 9%. Scandal widens Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Given the issues they've [Volkswagen] been experiencing over the last six weeks or so, some small adjustment is to be expected."" He said that the fall in Volkswagen car sales could be down to the ""overall market levelling off"", but also that the emissions scandal ""invariably will cause some people to think again about purchasing, or just to find out more information, which can delay sales"". But Steve Fowler from Auto Express said the VW scandal could be depressing the wider car market. ""A decline in sales had to happen eventually - three-and-a-half years of growth - it's going to slow at some stage. But I do think the Volkswagen emissions scandal has had a clear effect,"" he said. ""We know a lot of people who've been in touch with us who are delaying a purchase. They still want to buy a car, but they're just not sure what they should do and frankly, who they should trust at the moment."" The Volkswagen group has been under close scrutiny since the emissions scandal broke in September. US regulator the Environmental Protection Agency found software installed in cars with a certain VW diesel engine that cheated emissions tests. VW later admitted about 11 million cars worldwide were affected by the issue. The scandal has widened to include carbon dioxide emissions ""irregularities"" thought to have included 800,000 cars in Europe.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dashcam footage submission website goes live,"The website allows visitors to upload videos before sending footage to the right police force. It also redirects visitors to those forces with their own submission websites. One road safety charity called the website a ""fantastic initiative, which couldn't be more timely"". Fragmented system The rapid adoption of dashcams in recent years, as well as the availability of cameras on mobile phones, has left the police scrambling to keep up with a growing supply of road footage. A fragmented system has emerged, with road users submitting videos on social media, email and even DVD to different police forces. The new website, built by dashcam manufacturer Nextbase, aims to streamline submissions, though some geographic variability still exists. If you film an incident in Stoke, for example, you can now fill out details online but will still need to submit the report via email to Staffordshire Police. If you are in Worcester, however, you can submit your video through the platform to West Mercia Police as it is a partner. ""While the benefits to motorists of this groundbreaking portal are clear, this convenience extends to police forces,"" said Supt Paul Moxley, of West Mercia Police. ""A process which previously took hours can now be reduced to a matter of minutes."" 'Elegant solution' Joshua Harris, director of campaigns at road safety charity Brake, said: ""This is a fantastic initiative, which couldn't be more timely."" He hopes that the website will help the police process video evidence more efficiently. ""This portal is an elegant solution, which enables the police to process this vital data without wasting their scarce resources,"" he added. Though the platform should make it easier for road users to submit footage, it remains for the police to decide whether to prosecute. Privacy concerns Privacy groups have highlighted the trade-off between road safety and privacy. ""It is true that, in rare cases, dash-cam footage can help investigations but it is questionable whether that merits encouraging motorists to constantly film each other,"" a spokesperson for Big Brother Watch told the BBC. ""Whilst everyone wants safe roads, we should be cautious to avoid breeding a culture of citizen surveillance and suspicion.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
India raises withdrawal limit as rupee anger mounts,"Customers can now withdraw up to 2,500 rupees a day from cash machines, rather than 2,000, the finance ministry said. Many cash machines are not working because they have not been adapted for the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes. Long queues at many banks were making it difficult to make withdrawals. The government said Indian banks had received 3 trillion rupees ($44bn; Â£35bn) of large denomination notes since the move was announced on Tuesday night. The abolition of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes is intended to crack down on corruption and bring cash worth billions of dollars in unaccounted wealth back into the economy. The two notes accounted for more than four fifths of the currency in circulation and the change threatens to disrupt much of India's cash-driven economy. The government has also relaxed withdrawal limits from banks, removing the 10,000 rupees a day restriction and increasing the weekly limit by 4,000 rupees to 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India urged people not to hoard cash, adding that rupees were available ""when they need it"". It has asked banks to report daily rather than fortnightly the amount of cash withdrawn and exchanged to give a more accurate picture of circulation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the ""pain"" being experienced by millions but said the scheme was ""not born from arrogance"". ""This hardship is only for 50 days,"" he said in a speech in Goa on Sunday. ""Please, 50 days, just give me 50 days. After 30 December, I promise to show you the India that you have always wished for."" Indians have until 30 December to exchange the now-defunct notes at banks. Since being elected in 2014, Mr Modi has pledged to crack down on ""black money"" kept hidden from authorities. The ""black economy"" could account for about a fifth of India's GDP, according to investment firm Ambit. His political opponents said they would unite to fight the abolition of the high denomination notes, which has made lives difficult for millions of ordinary people - particularly those without bank accounts who keep their savings in cash. Mulayam Singh Yadav, leader of Samajwadi party, called on the prime minister to reverse his decision.

"Objective reality exists, says UK minister Matt Hancock","By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Matt Hancock said it was ""something of a disappointment"" that he had to state publicly that ""objective reality exists"". But it was ""incredibly important"" to hang on to that principle in the ""unregulated space"" of social media. The digital minister was giving evidence to a House of Lords committee. He said the UK government was ""concerned about the rise of what is called fake news"" and there was ""a lot of work to do to make sure we have reasonable objective information underpinning our democratic discourse"". ""Politics is a rough business and there is always going to be disagreement over the facts but having that objective reality... is incredibly important. ""And thankfully in the UK we do have a regulated broadcast sector, which provides for a very significant proportion of trusted news."" 'Adult websites' It was ""very difficult"" for governments to take action against fake news without undermining free speech, said Mr Hancock, and the best way to tackle it was through fact checking, education, transparency and other methods of ""challenge"". Facebook recently launched a tool to let people see if they have ""liked"" foreign propaganda posts. Mr Hancock said initiatives like this proved the social media giants were taking the problem seriously. But he added: ""The social media companies themselves don't want to be the arbiters of truth and whilst I am unapologetic in thinking that objective reality exists the best way to find it is through challenge. ""Would you want the big social media platforms themselves to decide what is and isn't true? And not allow things that they deem untrue to be put on their platforms or published?"" Mr Hancock also hit back at claims the UK government, or any national government, was powerless in the face of giant global corporations like Facebook and Google. He said the UK was ""leading the world"" in ""how to make sure that ultimately the internet is a force for good in the world rather than a free-for-all"". He cited age verification for ""adult"" websites, which he said had now been adopted by global porn sites, and tighter privacy rules on the collection of data from those aged under 16, announced on Monday, The UK government's attitude had shifted from a ""libertarian"" approach to the internet, he said, to one which promotes freedom but ""also involves mitigating harm"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tunisia attack: Sousse killer Rezgui 'trained in Libya',"A senior official at the Tunisian interior ministry told the Associated Press that Rezgui had been in Libya in January, the same time as two men who attacked a Tunisian museum in March. Most of the dead in Sousse were foreign tourists, including 30 Britons. The Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the attack as its own. ""The attacker trained in Libya with weapons at the same period as the Bardo [museum] attackers,"" Rafik Chelli from the interior ministry told AP. IS also said it was behind the Bardo museum attack in Tunis that left 22 people dead. Mr Chelli said that Rezgui had travelled to the Libyan town of Sabratha at the same time as the Bardo attackers. ""He crossed the borders secretly,"" Mr Chielli told AP. IS has a significant presence in Libya, Tunisia's eastern neighbour, and is thought to control the major towns of Derna and Sirte. The Tunisian authorities have released photos of two suspects, Bin Abdallah and Rafkhe Talari - friends of Rezgui that the police have yet to locate. Rezgui, 23, was radicalised while studying engineering. Radicalisation The Tunisian authorities have already arrested several suspected accomplices. However, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi has admitted that the security services were not prepared for an attack of this kind. He said extra security had been put in place at other locations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, but nobody had expected beaches to be a target. The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible, and has urged people to be vigilant. Tour companies have laid on extra flights and about 10,000 British tourists have flown home from Tunisia since Friday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. Repatriation The repatriation of bodies of Britons killed in the attack will begin on Wednesday, Downing Street has said. Twenty-one Britons have been identified as victims, with nine more believed to be among the dead, it added. Three Irish tourists, two Germans, a Belgian and a Portuguese national died in the attack. The repatriation process is expected to take several days and will be followed by a joint inquest into the deaths of all the British victims.

Lend Lease chosen to build Wrexham super-prison,"Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said the project would be a ""massive boost"" for the local economy with half of the jobs available going to local people. Work is expected to start in August, creating up to 1,000 jobs, and the prison is due to open in late 2017. It will house 2,100 inmates, making it the largest prison in the UK. The overall project spend is lower than the original Â£250m estimate and the construction will involve local business and enterprises, with 100 apprenticeships created. Mr Wright said the prison, which will be the first in north Wales, would be a significant boost to the prison estate and would hold offenders closer to home and help prevent reoffending. Australian based building giant Lend Lease was one of four companies bidding for the Â£151m construction part of the super prison contract. The UK government's Welsh Secretary, David Jones, said the prison would be a ""huge boost"" for the local economy. Aled Roberts, Welsh Liberal Democrat AM for north Wales said the prison would be a much-needed boost to the community. ""Our region needs a prison as it's simply not right that families from north Wales have had to travel such long distances to visit family members. ""The emotional and financial strain put on these families is simply unacceptable,"" he said. It is believed about 760 staff positions will be created to run the prison, and officials have said it will boost the local economy by Â£23m a year. 'Scepticism' But a review carried out for independent think-tank the Institute of Welsh Affairs claimed that the prison might not deliver the promised jobs and could damage the local economy. The Ministry of Justice dismissed the claims and said it was replacing ""older, inefficient"" buildings. The review also said that potential benefits for Welsh prisoners should be treated with ""scepticism"" and that only a quarter of the prison's population might end up being from Wales. Plaid Cymru have also criticised Friday's announcement, claiming the region would not benefit. ""Only half the labour will be recruited locally, with local defined as a one hour commute,"" stated north Wales Plaid AM, Llyr Gruffydd. ""What we have here is a large multi-national Australian firm winning the contract and creaming the profits."" Outline planning permission for the prison has already been granted. The proposals include three four-storey house blocks up to 59ft (18m) in height.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Record high child mental health waiting numbers in Scotland,"At the end of December, there were 10,820 young people waiting to start treatment at CAMHS. This compares with 9,337 during the same period in 2018 and a low of 7,620 in December 2017. The official stats show that two-thirds of children were seen within 18 weeks, well below the 90% target. The Scottish government standard states children and young people should start treatment within 18 weeks of referral to CAMHS. In the last three months of last year only NHS Borders, NHS Orkney and NHS Western Isles met the standard, with NHS Lothian seeing less than half within the allotted timeframe. The statistics show 272 children and young people who were seen during the final quarter of 2019 had waited over a year. A further 589 children who were still waiting at the end of December had already been waiting over a year. There were 3,884 children and young people starting treatment in the final quarter of 2019, a 14.1% decrease from the same quarter in 2018. There are now more than 30,000 open cases in CAMHS. Mental health problems The Scottish Children's Services Coalition said the waiting time figures highlighted the ""desperate need"" for increased investment. A spokesman said: ""The simple fact is that we are continuing to fail thousands of children and young people with mental health problems, and more clearly needs to be done to address this epidemic.""

Fear suppressing neurons found,"By Melissa HogenboomScience reporter, BBC Radio Science These inhibitory neurons ensure that a neutral memory of a context or location is not contaminated by an unpleasant event occurring at the same time. The team says their work could one day help them better understand the neural basis of conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder. The study is published in Science. Attila Losonczy, from Columbia University in New York and colleagues, were interested in how the hippocampus stores memories of a particular context and then separates this memory from a fearful event. When looking at individual neurons in the brains of mice, they found inhibitory cells - called interneurons - were crucial for fear memory formation to travel to the correct part of the brain. ""These cells are activated by the unpleasant salient event and they act somewhat like a filter. They may function to block out unwanted information related to this strong, salient event,"" Dr Losonczy told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Stopping fear ""This way, the hippocampus can process and store contextual information reliably and independently without the potentially detrimental interference from this [unpleasant] salient event,"" he added. When mice were conditioned to express fear in a particular context, they later associated the same environment with the unpleasant event. But when scientists deactivated these inhibitor neurons, the mice no longer showed any fear. That is, the team was able to stop the mice from forming fearful memories. This highlighted the importance of the role of these interneurons on first encoding the fearful memory before it was passed onto another part of the brain. ""The next time this aversive stimulus is not present, we should still be able to remember the context correctly,"" Dr Losonczy explained. ""This contextual representation is then played out from the hippocampus to other brain areas like the amgydala where the actual association between the context and the fearful event takes place."" Understanding how context and fear are learned and the specific neurons involved, could help scientists better help people with conditions like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders. ""If we understand how the circuits in our brain influence memory under normal conditions, we can then try to understand what actually went wrong during psychiatric disorders,"" added Dr Losonczy. Parallel processing Xu Liu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, who was not involved with the research, said that the study was a cleverly designed way to ""peek into the mouse's brain and zoom into the cells of interest while the animal was learning"". ""This study solved the puzzle of how the hippocampus can successfully encode the context, while ignoring the impact of the ongoing negative stimulus."" ""[It] shows one mechanism for parallel-processing in the brain, where temporally overlapping inputs are disentangled and sorted into separate pipelines for further processing,"" Dr Liu told BBC News.

Global dip in renewable energy investment,"By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter, BBC News It said investment fell for the second year in a row because of cheaper technology, but also as a result of uncertainty surrounding energy policy. However, falling costs meant renewables accounted for 8.5% of the global electricity mix, up from 7.8% in 2012. Renewables accounted for 43.6% of newly installed generation capacity in 2013. The report - Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2014 - was produced by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Falling costs The assessment said the US $214.4bn (Â£129.2bn) worldwide investment in the renewable sector during 2013 was 23% below the 2011 record. One of the report's lead editors, UN energy expert Eric Usher, described 2013 as a ""mixed year"" for global renewable energy. Identifying the reasons behind the fall in investment, he explained: ""One of the major factors was the fall in the cost of equipment. ""Another negative factor was a touch of policy uncertainty, which saw investors delay spending their money."" He told BBC News that the fall in the cost of the clean energy technologies - particularly solar - had ""left some governments thinking that they had been paying too much and reviewed their subsidies"". Mr Usher added that while some nations, such as Germany, had been able to adapt very quickly, ""other nations have not handled it quite so well, causing nervousness among investors"". He explained that for a number of years, there was overcapacity in the sector and supply was greater than demand, making it difficult for firms to record a profit. But lower costs, improved efficiencies and market consolidation had allowed companies to return to profitability. Mr Usher observed that there were a number of positive signs during 2013, including the fact that the renewable energy sectors in a number of nations, particularly in Latin America, were able to grow completely free of government subsidies. He added: ""For the first time in 2013, China installed more new generation capacity using renewables than fossil fuels. ""So it is a good sign for the sector that the world's largest emerging economy is taking the sector very seriously indeed."" Responding to the assessment, Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: ""A long-term shift in investment over the next few decades towards a cleaner energy portfolio is needed to avoid dangerous climate change, with the energy sector accounting for around two-thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions. ""The fact that renewable energy is gaining a bigger share of overall generation globally is encouraging. To support this further, we must re-evaluate investment priorities, shift incentives, build capacity and improve governance structures."" The report's findings are being presented to a Future of Energy Summit in New York, US, which runs until Wednesday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
British bluebells 'have advantage over Spanish bluebells',"By Helen BriggsBBC News The introduced Spanish variety has lower fertility and is unlikely to wipe out the native plant, according to genetic tests. The Spanish bluebell's escape into the wild has raised concerns that the two plants could mix, leading to the loss of one of the spectacles of spring. The violet-blue flowers appear in April and May, carpeting the woodland floor. It turns out that the British bluebell has a genetic advantage. ""The greater fertility of the native British bluebell coupled with the huge numbers of individuals that exist in the wild means that it's got considerable resilience against any threat from these introduced plants,"" said Prof Pete Hollingsworth, director of science at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE). The British bluebell is one of the nation's best-loved plants, with 50% of the world's population found in the UK. What is a bluebell? The native bluebell, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, also goes by the name common bluebell, wood bell, fairy flower and wild hyacinth. Millions of bulbs can be found in just one ancient woodland, giving rise to carpets of flowers in April and May. The Spanish bluebell, Hyacinthoides hispanica, was introduced into the UK by the Victorians as a garden plant and can be found today alongside the native bluebell in woodlands as well as on road verges and in gardens. How do you tell which type of bluebell is which? The two plants look similar but have some tell-tale differences: Spanish bluebells have broad leaves, pale blue conical-bell flowers, with spreading and open tips, and flowers are found all around the stem. They have upright stems, no scent, and coloured pollen inside. Native bluebells have narrow leaves, deep violet-blue (sometimes white), narrow, tubular-bell flowers, with tips that curl back, flowers on one side of the stem, distinctly drooping stems, a sweet scent, and cream-coloured pollen. Source: Identify bluebells - The Wildlife Trusts What does the study show? In research to look at the potential genetic threat, the Spanish bluebell was planted next to the British bluebell in large numbers and allowed to breed naturally. More stories you might like: The native bluebell was more fertile and set more seeds than the Spanish bluebell, saving it from the threat of ""extinction by hybridisation"". It appears that the Spanish bluebell may already be a hybrid, with reduced fertility, even though locally it can escape, spread and be hard to remove from gardens. ""When examined, the pollen of the non-native bluebells in the UK was often misshapen - indicating lower pollen fertility, compared to the pollen of the native bluebell,"" said Dr Deborah Kohn of RBGE. The research, published in the journal, Conservation Genetics, was carried out with the University of Toronto and Lincoln University, New Zealand. Follow Helen on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan,"The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March cost taxpayers more than Â£85m. That included Â£34m in a settlement and legal fees with Eurotunnel - which said it was not considered for the contract. The government said it would not be committing to buying extra capacity but would have options to do so if needed. ""The Department for Transport is putting in place a freight capacity framework agreement that will provide government departments with the ability to secure freight capacity for our critical supply chains as and when required,"" a spokesman said. ""This framework does not commit the government to purchasing or reserving any freight capacity, but it does provide a flexible list of operators and options for the provision of the capacity that can be drawn upon if needed."" The government had previously awarded Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries contracts worth more than Â£100m - all of which were eventually cancelled. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling faced calls to resign after he was forced to axe a Â£13.8m contract with Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships or trading history. All three previous contracts - intended to offer extra capacity and relieve potential congestion at ports like Dover - had been awarded without a full public tender process and prompted legal action from Eurotunnel. The government also had to pay more than Â£51m to cancel agreements with DFDS and Brittany Ferries when the UK asked the EU for an extension to the withdrawal process meaning it did not leave as planned on 29 March. This time, the Department for Transport is pursuing an open process, inviting bids from all ""suitably qualified freight operators"". Andrew Dean, a former government lawyer who is now director of public law at Clifford Chance, said: ""The department has played a straight bat, having opted to follow a relatively low-risk procurement approach that is open to suppliers from across the EU and beyond."" BBC business correspondent Joe Miller said that Eurotunnel would be able to bid this time around, as the notice invites applications ""regardless of transport mode"", as long as they offer ""roll-on, roll-off capacity"" for lorries. Seaborne Freight confirmed it would not be bidding again, while Britanny Ferries said it would ""carefully consider"" what capacity it could offer the government.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

As for press speculation that the band were about to split or that Amelle was leaving the band, Heidi was keen to dismiss both. 'Not splitting' She said: ""I know I 100% want to be in the band, and Jade does and Amelle does and we all want the same thing, so we're definitely not splitting up. ""Amelle wants to be in the band more than ever. When she's feeling better we'll be cracking on."" Since the recent line up change, there were also reports that the girls had fallen out following a row at a photoshoot over who would stand in the middle, but Heidi says that was totally made up. The singer says she's confident she has no regrets about recent changes made to the band. ""At the end of the day I've got nothing to hide,"" she added. ""Through the whole line up change and everything else I know thatâ¦ I made the right decision morally and I can live with a clear conscience."" Sugababes have had to cancel their first live performance together since the line up change. Heidi and Jade will still be attending a meet and greet for fans at a scheduled performance in Leeds but they will not be appearing on a German TV show this weekend. Despite recent contractual issues which halted an earlier gig at the Scottish Royal Variety Performance, Heidi confirmed that Sugababes would still continue to keep their name. She says she hasn't seen former band member Keisha since the split but wished her well.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Carney says house price boom is 'manageable',"He said the bank is acting in a ""graduated and proportionate way"" to stop the housing market getting out of control. He told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the strength of the recovery has exceeded expectations. The UK economy grew 0.8% in the third quarter, and business surveys see further growth in the fourth quarter. Mr Carney sought to reassure members of the committee about the housing market, as prices continue to rise not just in London but in many parts of the UK. ""In its most recent Financial Stability Report the FPC (Financial Policy Committee) paid particular attention to the risks posed by the recovery in the UK housing market. These risks are manageable and are being managed,"" he said. Recent economic growth means that ""barring further shocks"" there was no prospect of further quantitative easing, he said. Debt concern However, he warned that unless the public and private debt situation in the UK improved, and unless an economic recovery in Europe took hold, then the recovery may be less robust than the current growth rate suggests. Mr Carney defended his policy of forward guidance - a promise not to consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate has reached 7%. ""My experience, having met more than 300 businesses around the country, is that business people understand forward guidance well,"" said Mr Carney. Earlier this month the governor said that he was concerned about ""potential developments"" in the UK housing market. 'Warp speed' In a recent speech made in New York, he said the Bank could change mortgage rules to prevent the housing market getting out of control. ""There is a history of things shifting in the UK and the housing market of moving from stall speed to warp speed and underwriting standards slipping. So we want to avoid that,"" Mr Carney said. In his testimony on Tuesday to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Mr Carney questioned the economist Larry Summers' theory of secular stagnation in the economies of the developed world. He said there needs to be a ""degree of scepticism"" when applying Summers' theory of a possible reduction in the capacity of the UK economy.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Asbestos: Cwmcarn High School could reopen after scare,"Cwmcarn High School in Caerphilly county closed in October after a report said asbestos posed a threat to health. But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is an ""essentially uncontaminated school"" after new tests. Meanwhile, members of the Welsh assembly members will meet later on Tuesday to discuss the threat of asbestos in schools. The cross-party group is chaired by Conservative AM Nick Ramsay, who has backed a ""right to know"" campaign to create an online database about levels of asbestos in all Welsh schools. It would include information about all school buildings and be available for anyone to search. Michael Imperato, a solicitor who is part of the campaign, told BBC Radio Wales: ""Confusion is the word I would use, because if I was a parent or a teacher at Cwmcarn, where do you stand now? ""One minute we're saying the school has to be closed and the children bussed 12 miles up the valley and the next we're hearing today everything is okay, perhaps it can reopen. ""This illustrates exactly the point of the right to know campaign. ""People should be better informed, should be able to find out what the position is in their schools and then they can start to make informed choices and start to ask the right questions of local authorities, of school governors, of head teachers. ""It just empowers people to know a bit more about what's going on in something which is very important."" In October, Education Minister Leighton Andrews announced that all schools must deliver reports on asbestos levels after Cwmcarn was closed following testing. The report by Santia Asbestos Management Limited had said airborne fibres at the 900-pupil school were 10 times higher than the accepted levels. 'Council acted appropriately' However, on Monday it was revealed that a new report carried out on behalf of HSE by the Health and Safety Laboratory - which carries out scientific research - indicated that the risk to pupils and teachers at Cwmcarn was low. ""Having made both visual checks of the fabric and considering the results of the HSL testing, HSE believes it is an essentially uncontaminated school,"" said HSE. ""However, any decision on whether it should reopen rests with the school governors. It is their choice whether to use the HSL report in any decision making."" HSE said the method of testing carried out by Santia could ""overestimate the levels of asbestos fibres as it does not distinguish between asbestos fibres and other fibres such as paper, clothing and skin cells"". But HSE added: ""The council acted appropriately in closing the school, given the advice contained in the report they commissioned at the time."" The council and school have asked for a further survey but it will be three weeks before any decision is made. Students are currently being educated 12 miles away at Coleg Gwent's Ebbw Vale campus.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US slavery: How is America marking the 400th anniversary?,"Why is the date significant? In 1619, a ship arrived in an English settlement in what is now the US state of Virginia, carrying some 20 captured Africans. It's the first documented arrival of enslaved Africans in an area that would go on to become part of the United States. They had been seized by English pirates off the coast of Mexico, from a Portuguese slave ship. The Portuguese vessel had been carrying about 350 Africans, taken from what is now Angola. Many had died during the voyage because of the terrible conditions they endured. The English pirates went on to sell the Africans they had seized to colonists in Virginia, who needed labour. It's a matter of historical debate what exactly happened to them once they were sold. But formal systems of slavery and racial separation did become established in later years as the number of Africans brought over to America began to grow. Were they the first slaves taken to the Americas? Some experts say the significance of 1619 should not be over-emphasised because, by then, Africans were already being used on tobacco plantations in the English-run colony of Bermuda. It's also believed there were Africans on expeditions to both North and South America by English and Spanish maritime adventurers in the 16th Century. And Portuguese traders had been taking slaves to their colonies since the 15th Century. How is this anniversary being marked? The US Congress has established a special commission to mark 400 years of African-American history this year. Ms Pelosi's delegation to Ghana includes senior black members of the Congress. After visiting some of the sites from which enslaved people were shipped across the Atlantic, Ms Pelosi said it was ""a sobering testament to humanity's capacity for great evil."" Ghana has declared 2019 The Year of Return, with programmes aimed at encouraging people of African descent to visit and even settle. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, was in Jamestown, Virginia, this week to mark another anniversary - 400 years since the birth of representative democracy in the western hemisphere. However, he did note in a speech that it was also 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The Prodigy and Slash top Friday Download Festival bill,"By Del CrookesNewsbeat reporter at Download Festival The dance band were 20 minutes late for their set but made up for it with more than an hour of hits including Voodoo People and Firestarter. The festival started more than two hours late. Organisers had tried to make the arena and main stage safe following high winds and heavy rain. The entire site at Donington Park was turned into a quagmire with tractors needed to help cars get in and out of some parts of the car parks. One junction of the M1 was also closed as queues of up to three hours formed. Shows cancelled Fans took to Twitter to vent their frustrations. Lara Baker said: ""Can't get near the Download site, insane traffic. And now apparently the arena is closed as the mud is SO bad. Great start...""

Eighties rock band Europe missed their slot at the festival after getting stuck in traffic and performances from Rise To Remain and Cancer Bats were cancelled because of the late start. No more rain is forecast at the site until later on Sunday (10 June). Inspector Chris Brown from Leicestershire Police said: ""People are coping well despite the weather and spirits are high among festival-goers and police officers. ""Reported crime is lower than it was this time last year. ""We've evicted a number of people from the site and a 30-year-old man from Manchester has been charged with three counts of theft involving cash and mobile phones.

'Â£5m needed' to upgrade Wales' substandard state bridges,"By Nelli BirdBBC Radio Wales News Of the 1,263 bridges, 39 do not comply with regulations but the government has ""reassured"" drivers they are all safe. The Institution for Civil Engineers in Wales says the Genoa bridge collapse, which killed 43, must be a ""call to action"" on infrastructure investment. General bridge inspections happen every two years, says the government. An RAC Foundation report in January said 361 local council-maintained bridges in Wales - out of 6,694 - were ""substandard"" and would cost Â£98m to bring them into a ""good, if not perfect condition"". No bridges in Wales are of a similar design to the Morandi Bridge in Genoa but the government says hundreds are from the same era and made from concrete and steel which may be vulnerable to corrosion. ""It's a very difficult decision that politicians have to make,"" said Keith Jones, Institution of Civil Engineers Wales Cymru director. ""Do you prioritise a crumbling school, a library roof, social services or do you carry out more maintenance on bridges? ""But this bridge collapse that we've seen tragically in Genoa, I think we should take as a call to action to make sure that the whole of the travelling public is aware that we need to invest in the very infrastructure on which our lives demand."" Substandard bridges can still be used by traffic but may have weight or speed restrictions in place to ensure safety. The Welsh Government say they will be represented at the UK Bridges Board where ""the Morandi Bridge collapse will be discussed"" and ""further action will be taken accordingly"". ""Welsh Government will seek to learn lessons from Genoa when the causes are known,"" said a spokesperson. ""Welsh Government has a rigorous inspection regime for all of its structures - taking into account design, age and the likely maintenance needs. ""General inspections are undertaken every two years with more detailed principal inspections typically every six years, which involve close inspection of all parts of a structure. We can reassure drivers and other road users that safety is and always will be our top priority."" The Welsh Local Government Association, the body which represents Wales' 22 councils, said while the catastrophic failure of bridges is rare, local authorities would be following the investigation in Genoa in case there are ""lessons to be learned"". A spokesman added: ""Local authorities in Wales have processes in place, including inspection regimes, for managing their bridges. ""Not all bridges need to carry '44 tonne' vehicles. The use of appropriate weight restrictions is a normal part of managing the bridge stock for local authorities.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Three generations of Hull family 'lucky to survive',"Keri Rennison, 48, lives with her parents Paul, 71, and Jackie, 72, daughter Rosie, 25, and her 56-year-old partner Chris Westoby in Hull. All five, who have been living together in Victoria Avenue since 2013, contracted the virus last month. ""It's brought us even closer,"" Ms Rennison said. Ms Rennison, who works as a mental health nurse in Grimsby, said she thought the whole family had caught the virus because she and her partner are key workers. ""It's been very, very difficult knowing that we might have brought the virus into the household,"" she said. ""However we've been very, very meticulously careful in terms of hygiene. ""It's hard when you live together."" Her father Paul was the first to fall ill, being taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. He was followed by Ms Rennison, before the virus spread to the rest of the family. ""It was awful,"" said her mother Jackie. ""I turned to [her granddaughter] Rosie and I said 'I'm never going to see [my husband] again'. ""It still upsets me."" Keri Rennison said all five members of the family had not experienced the symptoms of a persistent cough and fever normally associated with Covid-19. ""It started with a loss of taste and sense of smell that has only just come back but it's still very, very weak,"" she said. ""And then I had fatigue and a headache for seven days after. ""My father was really the only one who had any sort of respiratory difficulties, which was just shortness of breath when he spoke. ""But as a family we realised that we're very, very lucky to have only got the symptoms mild and survived it. ""Most of all we're really thankful."" Keri and Chris were due to get married on 18 July but the couple had to postpone their wedding until next year, she said. ""It has been very difficult and quite upsetting to do but we just want everybody to be safe and things don't matter anymore. ""The way we feel about each other doesn't change.

Redcar Regent Cinema demolition inspires memory 'flood',"Redcar's Regent Cinema opened as a music hall, the Pavilion, in 1928, and was where Larry Grayson, performing under stage name Billy Breen, coined his ""shut that door"" catchphrase. It closed in 2018 and a new cinema is now planned for the seafront site. Redcar and Cleveland Council said there had been a ""fantastic"" response to an appeal for memories of the place. Online messages recalled marriage proposals, Charlie Chaplin impersonators, ""fire dancers"" and usherettes falling as they tried to sell ice creams in the dark. One woman told how her mother used to take in actors as lodgers, and complained about ""stage make-up on the bedding and requests for cooked meals at midnight."" People also recalled the premiere of Hollywood movie Atonement in 2007 after some scenes were filmed on Redcar beach. Former Mayor Wendy Wall, who took to the red carpet that evening, messaged to say it was ""one of the greatest nights of my life"". The Pavilion was where performer Grayson, who went on to host the Generation Game, coined his famous ""shut that door"" catchphrase, inspired by a door which kept blowing open. However, one local man got in touch to say his aunt, Joan Foulkes, always claimed to have invented the phrase. Gordon Middlemiss said: ""She told me about it numerous times. ""She lived in South Bank then and was a regular. This one day, it must have been the late 1940s, Larry Grayson - he was known as Billy Breen then - was on and the door kept opening with the wind blowing through. ""My aunt had had enough and eventually piped up, 'Oh, I'm fed upâ¦shut that door!' ""It got a big laugh and Larry took it up."" The door itself was found last year after having been bricked up for decades. Councillor Wayne Davies, cabinet member for economic development, said: ""It's been fantastic to get such a strong reaction from people about The Regent. ""Now we must look to the future and a brand, new venue to create happy memories for generations to come."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Coronavirus: Almost 900 Manchester Airports Group job cuts,"Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said 465 roles were under threat at Manchester Airport as well as 376 at London Stansted Airport and 51 at East Midlands Airport. It confirmed it would begin talks with unions about the potential job losses. The Unite union blamed the government's ""failure to support to the aviation sector"" for the ""bitter blow"". A government spokesperson said it would keep the approach to quarantine rules ""under constant review"". He added: ""We recognise that this will be a very difficult time for Manchester Airport Group employees and their loved ones, and we are continuing to support them."" MAG said there had been a massive reduction in travel at its airports with only 2.8m passengers between April and August compared to 30.3m the previous year. It said it had already taken steps to reduce costs, including asking employees to take a 10% pay cut for a year, pausing investment and reducing its management team. However, it said the ""absence of support for the aviation sector, coupled with a lack of progress in introducing testing for UK passengers, has continued to undermine consumer confidence in air travel"". It said passenger demand was not expected to recover fully before 2023-24. 'Dramatic cuts' Charlie Cornish, chief executive of MAG, said: ""The specific and short-term pressures of the pandemic are exceptional and particularly challenging for our sector. ""The end of the job retention scheme means we have to consider the number of roles that we can sustain at our airports."" He said it would be working closely with unions ""to make sure we minimise the impact on our people as much as we can"". He added: ""I want to thank everyone across MAG for the dedication they have shown through the toughest summer our industry has ever seen."" Lawrence Chapple-Gill, from Unite, said the ""dramatic cuts"" would come as a ""bitter blow to the hard working staff at Manchester Airport"". The job losses were an ""inevitable consequence of the government's failure to provide sector specific support to the aviation industry, the sector most heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic"", he said. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said Manchester Airport was ""critical"" to the region's economy. The former Labour MP said the government had left the aviation industry ""swinging in the wind"" and called on it to provide the sector with financial help.

Falkirk vote-rigging claims: Jack Straw calls for new inquiry,"On BBC2's Daily Politics, the Labour MP said there was ""a sufficient case... for there to be further questions that will need to be dealt with"". The Sunday Times newspaper has reported that Unite thwarted the party's initial investigation. The union was accused of rigging the selection of a parliamentary candidate. It denied doing ""anything untoward"" during Labour's internal investigation. The affair began when Falkirk MP Eric Joyce announced he would be stepping down at the next general election in 2015 after he was convicted of assault at a House of Commons bar. 'Fears' Labour investigated allegations earlier in 2013 that Unite had tried to sign up members without their knowledge in the constituency so that the union's favoured candidate was chosen to contest the 2015 general election for Labour. The investigation cleared Unite and its members of any wrongdoing after key witnesses withdrew their allegations, but the Sunday Times said it had seen a cache of emails raising questions about whether Unite influenced the outcome of the inquiry. Mr Straw said: ""I don't think this is going to go away."" Falkirk MP Eric Joyce said Labour was protecting the Unite organiser at the centre of a selection row because it ""fears"" the organisation's leadership. Unite official Stevie Deans, who had worked at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant for about 25 years, resigned on Monday. He had been suspended by owner Ineos over claims he had used company time for political campaigning work. Ineos had been expected to reveal the outcome of a disciplinary case against him on Tuesday. The union previously voted for strike action over his treatment, which led to last week's shutdown of the plant. 'Catastrophic tactics' Separately, Mr Deans was accused of being involved in the Falkirk vote-rigging claims. He was suspended from the Labour Party but was later cleared by an investigation and reinstated. Former Foreign Secretary Mr Straw, the Labour MP for Blackburn, said the union had adopted ""catastrophic tactics"" in the industrial dispute at Grangemouth. ""Whichever way you look at what happened at Grangemouth it's hard to see how on earth the Unite union ended up with those tactics,"" he continued. ""Is there something of concern there? Of course there is. And is it a saga that does not reflect well on the national leadership of Unite - both in respect of their relations with the Labour Party but also in respect of their representation of their members at a huge plant like Grangemouth? Yes."" Unite chief of staff Andrew Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Neither Unite nor anyone working for Unite made any contact with any witness to the Falkirk inquiry at all. ""All the statements that were sent in were agreed, approved and signed to the best of my knowledge by the people who signed them. ""There is no evidence even in the emails that have been printed by the Sunday Times that Mr Deans did anything untoward at all.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Grenfell Tower final death toll stands at 71,"The number of victims includes baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, the day the 24-storey blaze broke out. The final two victims to be formally identified have been named as Victoria King and daughter Alexandra Atala. The Met said it was providing ""every support we can"" to the bereaved. Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said: ""I have been clear from the start that a priority for us was recovering all those who died, and identifying and returning them to their families. ""Specialist teams working inside Grenfell Tower and the mortuary have pushed the boundaries of what was scientifically possible to identify people. ""After the fire was finally put out, I entered Grenfell Tower and was genuinely concerned that due to the intensity and duration of the fire, that we may not find, recover and then identify all those who died. ""I know that each and every member of the team has done absolutely all they can to make this possible."" In June, the Met had a list of 400 missing people - some of whom were reported a number of times under different names or spellings, with one person in particular recorded 46 separate times. The work to investigate and locate all those reported as missing was only concluded in the last few weeks, the Met said. The family of Ms King, 71, and Ms Atala, 40, said they were ""devastated"" to learn of the pair's fate, adding that the mother and daughter were ""devoted to each other"". The original missing persons list was also made higher by fraudulent cases, police said, with some individuals attempting to benefit financially from the tragedy. There are a number of ongoing fraud investigations, and earlier this month one man pleaded guilty to fraud after claiming that his wife and son had both died in the fire. The Met is also investigating alleged thefts from seven flats at Grenfell Tower, although no perpetrators have yet been identified, according to BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. Searching every flat Commander Cundy told BBC News: ""There was only one way in and out of the tower and [CCTV] footage shows 223 people came out and survived."" He said not all 223 people were residents, some were visitors, and some residents were not in the tower at the time. While the final stage of the search operation is not expected to conclude until early December, the Met said in a statement: ""Based on all the work carried out so far and the expert advice, it is highly unlikely there is anyone who remains inside Grenfell Tower"". Specially trained officers from the Met, City of London Police and British Transport Police have been involved in the search and recovery operation, thoroughly searching every single flat on every single floor. Officers have examined 15.5 tonnes of debris on each floor, helped by forensic anthropologists, archaeologists and forensic dentists or odontologists.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Syrian refugee families to be housed in Llandrindod Wells,"They would be the first to be placed in Llandrindod Wells, which was recently named the happiest place to live in Wales. A report to the council said there were concerns over long waiting lists for council houses in the town. Powys council's cabinet decided to house the six families on Tuesday. Ben Lloyd, Oxfam Cymru's campaigns and advocacy manager, welcomed the ""encouraging"" move. He said: ""The war in Syria is far from over, with over half of the population having fled their homes. ""Indeed, in the first six months of 2017, more people had been displaced in Syria than the same period last year and September declared as the 'deadliest' month in Syria's near seven-year conflict, with 3,000 people losing their lives. ""This shows that it is crucial that we take in our fair share of refugees and Powys County Council is showing a good example of how the response can be stepped up here in Wales."" All councils in Wales have now resettled Syrian families with more than 400 people taken in under a UK government scheme, funded by the Home Office's foreign aid budget. Half of the 12 families resettled in Powys since July 2016 are in Ystradgynlais with the remaining six in Newtown. These towns were chosen due to their relatively lower rate of demand for three-bed accommodation. A report by councillor Jonathan Wilkinson said the families had been made to feel welcome and have arranged events to thank their new neighbours. And a report into the success of the county's resettlement programme highlighted that all the Syrian families reported feeling safe and that they had progressed in learning English and gaining independence since arriving. But the families raised concerns the English language lessons had been ""inadequate"" as they wanted to progress faster. The council was ""unexpectedly surprised by the groundswell of support for the families"" and recommended a refugee charity be set up in the towns to help address the problems and consider recruiting a migration coordinator officer to work across the county. Councillor Gary Price, of Llandrindod North, said ""families already living within the county have integrated well"" with the communities they live in. He added: ""My only concern is the availability of suitable housing within Llandrindod Wells for an additional six families, given regular contact from constituents who have been on the council and registered social housing waiting list for considerable time. ""It is important that Powys residents already on these waiting lists are not prevented suitable housing from any proposals within the cabinet report."" Powys council said the process of housing the six additional families would begin ""as soon as possible"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Google announces AI ethics panel,"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The panel consists of eight people and includes former US deputy secretary of state, and a University of Bath associate professor. The group will ""consider some of Google's most complex challengesâ, the firm said. The panel was announced at MIT Technology Review's EmTech Digital, a conference organised the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Google has come under intense criticism - internally and externally - over how it plans to use emerging technologies. In June 2018 the company said it would not renew a contract it had with the Pentagon to develop AI technology to control drones. Project Maven, as it was known, was unpopular among Googleâs staff, and prompted some resignations. In response, Google published a set of AI âprinciplesâ it said it would abide by. They included pledges to be ""socially beneficial' and ""accountable to people"". The Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) will meet for the first time in April. In a blog post, Googleâs head of global affairs, Kent Walker, said there would be three further meetings in 2019. Google has published a full list of the panelâs members. It includes leading mathematician Bubacarr Bah, former US deputy secretary of state William Joseph Burns, and Prof Joanna Bryson, who teaches computer science at the University of Bath, UK. It will discuss recommendations about how to use technologies such as facial recognition. Last year, Googleâs then-head of cloud computing, Diane Greene, described facial recognition tech as having ""inherent biasâ due to a lack of diverse data. In a highly-cited thesis entitled Robots Should Be Slaves, Prof Bryson argued against the trend of treating robots like people. ""In humanising them,"" she wrote, ""we not only further dehumanise real people, but also encourage poor human decision making in the allocation of resources and responsibility."" In 2018 she argued that complexity should not be used as an excuse to not properly inform the public of how AI systems operate. ""When a system using AI causes damage, we need to know we can hold the human beings behind that system to account."" _____ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Leo Varadkar: Irish government wins confidence motion,"He has apologised ""for errors of judgement"" after passing a confidential agreement with one medical organisation to another rival one. The incident took place when he was the country's leader in 2019. The confidence motion on Tuesday evening was in response to Sinn FÃ©in's no-confidence motion in his position. Last week, Mr Varadkar told the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) that he gave the document to a friend as he wanted to use his office to provide better treatment and services for patients. He repeated his apology in the DÃ¡il on Tuesday saying his motivations were sound and he had learned from it. The current Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin told the DÃ¡il that Sinn FÃ©in's no-confidence motion in the tÃ¡naiste was a ""100% cynical move"". Mr Martin said the leaking of the confidential document was inappropriate and should not have happened, but he said nobody had demonstrated any personal gain and public policy was not adversely impacted. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Sinn FÃ©in was trying to sow division in government and to capitalise on a mistake by the tÃ¡naiste. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused the taoiseach of ""standing idly by"" while Mr Varadkar leaked a confidential document to his friend. She said the failure of Mr Martin to act was a ""failure of leadership"". The Labour Party said the tÃ¡naiste should have come clean and dispensed with the ""incredible yarn"" that he leaked the document for the good of the document. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said his party accepted Mr Varadkar's apology. The Social Democrats co-leader RÃ³isÃ­n Shortall claimed in the DÃ¡il that Mr Varadkar had ""concocted a false narrative"" regarding his leaking of the confidential document. Mr Varadkar was forced to speak about the incident following a report in Irish magazine Village. It said he passed a draft agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on new doctors' contracts to a close friend in another now defunct rival group in April 2019. The magazine raised questions as to whether he had breached the Official Secrets Act and broken the law. 'Not best practice' Mr Varadkar, a trained doctor, had earlier denied doing so and described the report as defamatory. He conceded that what he had done was ""not best practice"" but he had couriered the document to his friend to get wider backing from doctors for the new contract. At the time, Mr Martin, from Fianna FÃ¡il, and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan described their Fine Gael ministerial colleague's behaviour as ""inappropriate"" but backed him to remain in the three-party coalition government. Opposition parties including Sinn FÃ©in, Labour and the Social Democrats have all also described his behaviour as inappropriate and suggested he was looking after an insider and friend in what amounted to an ""old boys' club"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Female Islamic clerics in Indonesia issue rare child marriage fatwa,"The fatwa, which is not legally binding but will be influential, was issued after a three-day congress of female clerics in the country. The clerics urged the government to raise the minimum legal age for women to marry to 18 from the current 16. Indonesia is a majority Muslim country and has among the highest number of child brides in the world. According to the UN's children office Unicef, one in four women in Indonesia marries before the age of 18. Fatwas are issued regularly in Indonesia, but usually by the Indonesian Ulema Council - the highest Islamic authority in the country which is made up almost entirely of men. Who are Indonesia's female clerics? Hundreds of women descended on Cirebon, on Java Island, for the Indonesian KUPI Women's Ulema Congress. Most of the clerics - experts in Islamic sacred law and theology - were from Indonesia, but speakers travelled from as far away as Kenya, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to take part in the conference, said to be the first major gathering of female Muslim clerics. Female clerics, or ""ulema"", have existed in Indonesia for hundreds of years, but their role has been played down previously. Nowadays, they help empower their communities and lead educational institutes, organisers say. It is hoped the congress will highlight the vital role they play. Steering committee chairman Badriyah Fayumi told the BBC: ""Through this conference, we want to state that female clerics exist, and have been proven to contribute, and this is the time to acknowledge their existence, and to give an appreciation for the... contribution of the female clergy."" The committee will now present its recommendations to the relevant groups - including the government - which will then decide on whether or not to take them any further. The fatwa called underage marriage ""harmful"" and said preventing it was mandatory. ""Female clerics know the issues and obstacles women face, we can take action and do not just wait for the government to protect these children,"" Ninik Rahayu, the conference organiser, told Reuters. The female clerics cited studies which highlight that many Indonesian child brides are not allowed to continue their education and half the marriages end in divorce. The child marriage fatwa was one of a series issued during the congress. There were also edicts against women being sexually abused, and environmental destruction.

German nurse jailed for life for murdering patients,"The man, identified as Niels H, 38, was convicted of two counts of murder and attempted murder. He told the court last week he had acted on impulse and apologised to the victims' relatives. The deaths took place at the Delmenhorst clinic, where he worked in intensive care between 2003 and 2005. The former nurse was accused of injecting patients with a medication that should only be used under strict supervision of doctors because it can trigger fatal cardiovascular reactions. Prosecutors at the district court of Oldenburg said he had been bored and had wanted to practise his - as he himself described them - ""excellent"" resuscitation skills. If his first attempt at resuscitation was successful, they said, he would sometimes make a second attempt. A senior doctor heard earlier on in the trial described Niels H as a ""passionate medic"" who had made a good impression on staff at the clinic. Doctors did notice, however, that he always seemed to be around when patients were being resuscitated, often assisting junior doctors with the procedure, he added. Other deaths At an initial trial in 2008, he was convicted of attempted murder and given a seven-and-a-half year term. It was not until police began investigating the high number of deaths while he was at the clinic that the scale of his crimes became clear. Relatives of some of the deceased are asking why it took almost a decade before an investigation was launched when the death rate at the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled and the use of heart medicine went up dramatically during his time there. Although he was charged with three murders, the court found him guilty on only two counts, explaining that it could not be proved that the former nurse had been responsible for the third death. A psychiatric expert had earlier told the court that Niels H had admitted causing the deaths of 30 patients, while 60 others he had injected had survived. However, there are suspicions that the number of his victims is far higher. The police investigation involves at least 200 deaths, including at other clinics where he worked, at Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump appoints China critic Peter Navarro to trade post,"He will lead the White House National Trade Council, and serve as director of trade and industrial policy. Mr Navarro advised Mr Trump during the campaign. His books include The Coming China Wars and Death by China. Mr Trump has also named billionaire investor Carl Icahn to become a special adviser on regulatory reform. Mr Icahn, who will not be a federal employee, has said that US businesses are being ""crippled"" by excessive regulations. A statement from Mr Trump's transition team said the appointment of Peter Navarro showed his ""determination to make American manufacturing great again"". During the election, the president-elect made trade issues a core campaign issue, criticising deals made with countries like China and Mexico. Mr Trump has already angered China by speaking to the Taiwanese president by phone, in apparent contradiction with America's ""one China"" policy. He has also criticised China on Twitter, recently accusing it of deliberately devaluing its currency, among other claims. The latest move came as Chinese online retailer Alibaba was placed back on the US list of ""notorious markets"" over counterfeit goods sales. Alibaba Group President Michael Evans questioned whether the move was ""based on actual facts or influenced by the current political climate"". Mr Navarro adapted his book Death by China into a documentary film narrated by Martin Sheen. It is available to watch for free on YouTube. In its preamble, he urges viewers ""help defend America and protect your family - don't buy 'Made in China'."" The film highlights the sustained loss of American manufacturing jobs at a time of Chinese economic growth, as well as the environmental impact of Chinese industry. Many other economists, however, fear that aggressive moves against Chinese trade could prompt a trade war, with repercussions on both sides. Peter Navarro - in his own words The view from China - by BBC Monitoring Chinese media highlight Mr Navarro's strongly held views and his earlier literature on China. Many mention his book, Death By China, which alleges that the US is threatened by China's economic dominance. Shanghai-based website Observer Net says Mr Navarro is well known as ""an economist who advocates a tough stance on China"". Phoenix News calls him a ""Taiwan-friendly official"". But media largely play down any major shake-ups between the two countries. Popular news site The Paper quotes trade official Bai Ming as saying that ""appointing Navarro will of course increase the pressure on Sino-US trade"" but says that ""the United States' own national interests"" will also be taken into account.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Five things Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley told Newsbeat,"By Jonathan BlakeNewsbeat politics reporter Speaking to Newsbeat at a rally in Bristol, Mr Bartley said voting for a smaller party like his ""sends a message"" that change to the political system is needed. We are speaking to the party leaders hoping to win your vote when the general election is help on 8 June. Here are five things Jonathan Bartley told us. Donald Trump 'will be defeated' The president of the USA calling man-made climate change is a ""hoax"" will not stop a global deal on climate change from succeeding, Jonathan Bartley said. But he admitted these were ""bleak times"" with ""climate change deniers coming to power"". ""The world is bigger than Donald Trump, the movement against tackling climate change, particularly among young people who are so passionate about this issue, I think that's unstoppable. ""Whatever Donald Trump does, he will be defeated."" We should only work four days a week If the Greens were in charge we'd all get an extra day off per week. The party wants a four day working week to allow people to ""spend more time with their families"", Mr Barley said. ""We've had wealth created, technological advance but what we've seen is growing inequality with big corporations sucking money out of the economy. ""It's time to go and get that back."" The Greens should have 24 MPs but they only have one The system is against the Green Party, according to Jonathan Bartley. He says the share of vote the party gets on a national level should determine how many Members of Parliament it has, rather than having to win a majority of votes in each constituency to get an MP. But a vote for the Greens is still worthwhile, Mr Bartley said. ""Vote with your heart for the greens and that sends a very, very strong message to Westminster about the kind of country we want to have in the future."" Two leaders might be better than one Jonathan Bartley shares the job of Green Party leader with Caroline Lucas, the party's only Member of Parliament. Job-sharing is something that happens in other professions, and according to the Greens it's time politics ""caught up"". ""The idea is to think of new ways about how we do jobs generally in the economy and also in political life. ""My own situation is that I have a son who I need to support who's disabled, I wouldn't be able to do a full time lead role, but I'm able to do it with our MP Caroline Lucas."" He'll see you at Glastonbury When he's not leading a political party, Jonathan Bartley is the drummer in a blues band. ""I've been drumming since I was 11, I do about 40 or 50 gigs around the country. ""We're playing Glastonbury this year, I'm looking forward to that. ""It's great to do something completely different from politics every now and again and be creative.""

"Coronavirus: 'Tiger King' star now in virus isolation, says husband","Maldonado-Passage, 57, is serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse and his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot. He was placed in isolation when inmates at the jail where he was previously held tested positive for the virus, said his husband, Dillon Passage. There are currently 226,374 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the US. Maldonado-Passage had recently been transferred from Oklahoma's Grady County Jail to the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, US media report. ""We speak like three to five times every day, but since he's been moved to this new facility, they are putting him on a Covid-19 isolation because of the previous jail he was at, there were cases,"" Mr Passage, 24, told US entertainment reporter Andy Cohen. ""I've yet to speak to him since he moved."" When asked if Maldonado-Passage is in individual quarantine, Mr Passage said: ""From what I know, yes."" The US Bureau of Prisons announced on Wednesday that all those currently held in federal facilities - approximately 146,000 inmates, including Maldonado-Passage - will be put in quarantine for the next 14 days. The move comes amid a growing number of confirmed Covid-19 cases among incarcerated people. Dozens of federal inmates and at least 37 guards have tested positive so far. The US locks up more citizens per capita than any other country, with an estimated 2.3 million people behind bars in federal, state, and local prisons. Prison reform advocates say that prisoners face exceptional risk of infection, due to a lack of hygiene and overcrowding - effectively inhibiting any form of social distancing. Some US jails have already begun to release prisoners - focusing on ""vulnerable"" inmates - as the number of infected inmates continues to grow. The chief doctor at Rikers Island - New York City's largest jail - told the Washington Post newspaper that the current conditions are a ""public health disaster unfolding before our eyes"". Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, currently serving a 23-year sentence for rape and sexual assault, was transferred from Rikers after testing positive earlier this month. Maldonado-Passage - the subject of docuseries Tiger King and almost overnight fame - was convicted this year for two counts of murder-for-hire and several accounts of animal abuse. The zookeeper, who once owned hundreds of exotic animals at his park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, was accused of ordering the murder of Carole Baskin, a prominent animal rights activist. Mr Passage, Maldonado-Passage's fourth husband, told Mr Cohen that he plans to stay with his husband while he serves out his sentence. ""I do love Joe,"" Mr Passage said. ""He's been there for me through my darkest times. I'm not just gonna dip out and abandon him when he needs me most.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Westworld's Evan Rachel Wood says she's been raped twice in an open letter on Twitter,"In an open letter on Twitter, the 29-year-old said she'd been attacked by a ""significant other"" and a bar owner. She wrote the post after an interview in Rolling Stone magazine, in which she talked about being subjected to ""physical, psychological, sexual"" abuse and attempting suicide in her early 20s. The star said the attacks happened ""many, many years ago"". She also claimed that the rapes were ""one of the many factors"" that contributed to an attempt to take her own life. ""I don't believe we live in a time where people can stay silent any longer,"" she wrote. ""I certainly can't. Not given the state our world is in with its blatant bigotry and sexism. ""It should be talked about because it's swept under the rug as nothing and I will not accept this as 'normal'. It's a serious problem. ""I am still standing. I am alive. I am happy. I am strong. But I am still not ok. ""Yes, I have been raped. By a significant other while we were together. And on a separate occasion, by the owner of a bar."" In the letter the actress doesn't say whether she reported the alleged attacks to police or whether she took any legal action. ""The first time I was unsure that if it was done by a partner it was still in fact rape, until too late,"" she wrote. ""Also who would believe me. ""And the second time, I thought it was my fault and that I should have fought back more, but I was scared."" Evan Rachel Wood plays Dolores in Sky Atlantic's sci-fi Western series, Westworld. In the first episode her life-like robot character is shown being dragged off to be raped. But she's defended how the show depicts sexual violence. ""The thing about Westworld is we don't actually show any act of rape,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""I was affected by things being written off as locker-room talk - I had a very, very visceral reaction to it. But the show is definitely a commentary on that."" After posting the open letter, she revealed she'd be taking a break from Twitter. She said: ""Thank you for all your support and courageous stories.""

Emily Greene: Police admit failings in teen's abuse claim inquiry,"Emily Greene told South Yorkshire Police she had been assaulted by a man, but the force dropped the inquiry. She was found dead in a field near Barnsley in November 2018. Senior Coroner David Urpeth found there had been ""deficiencies"" in the way the initial allegation had been investigated. In his Prevention of Future Deaths report, Mr Urpeth also criticised the fact Emily was not seen personally to explain the decision to cease the investigation. He said police had ""mishandled"" a subsequent investigation into her disappearance. The force admitted it took officers more than three hours to attend her home address after she was reported missing on the day of her death. In a letter to Mr Urpeth, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police Stephen Watson said the force was ""committed to learning the lessons from this case"" and has already taken action in respect of the findings. He said the force accepted the initial investigation into the allegations made by Emily ""were not investigated to the standard expected by South Yorkshire Police"". He said a review of the claims found ""this investigation appears to fall well below the standards of what would be expected"" and that the decision to shelve the inquiry ""lacked rationale"". Mr Watson said the delay in responding to the missing persons report - which should have been dealt with in under an hour - was the result of the call being initially wrongly graded. However, he said once the mistake was spotted it was a further 71 minutes between re-grading and officers being assigned. He said: ""This time is not what is expected of either the Communications room staff or attending officers for this type of incident."" 'Little comfort to family' The handling of the missing persons report was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Complaints (IOPC). A spokesman said while it had identified ""failings"" there was no evidence of misconduct or a criminal offence. He said a separate investigation had been carried out into the handling of Emily's allegations of sexual assault and a report had been passed to the coroner. A spokesperson for South Yorkshire Police said the findings of the coroner and the IOPC had led to ""significant improvements in the way we operate"", adding: ""But we accept this holds little comfort for Emily's family who have been so deeply affected"".

Apple and Amazon deny China hack claims,"Apple and Amazon have both responded publicly to claims made by Bloomberg Businessweek which described the cyber-attack. ""There is no truth to these claims,"" said Apple's statement. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it had ""no reason to doubt"" Apple and Amazon's assessments. Bloomberg has yet to respond to a BBC request for a comment about the repeated denials from Apple and others. Earlier it said: ""We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources."" Full disclosure Published on 4 October, Bloomberg's story alleges that Chinese spies managed to insert chips on servers made in China that could be activated once the machines were plugged in overseas. The servers were manufactured for US firm Super Micro Computer Inc. The story suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apple were among 30 companies, as well as government agencies and departments, that used the suspect servers. Shares in Chinese tech firms including Lenovo and ZTE fell sharply following the publication of the Bloomberg report. The news agency's story, which Bloomberg said resulted from a 12-month investigation, relied on unnamed and unidentified sources which, it said, included insiders at both Amazon and Apple. Bloomberg linked to the denials given to it by the tech firms and Super Micro Computer when it approached them with its evidence. Now Apple has published its statement in full on its media site saying it had ""repeatedly explained"" to Bloomberg reporters that they were wrong. Apple said it had conducted ""rigorous internal investigations"" based on the evidence given to it by Bloomberg reporters and had found ""absolutely no evidence"" to support their claims. It said: ""On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server."" It added that it was not operating under any ""gag order"" or any other confidentiality restriction that stopped it sharing information. Amazon published a blog that also said the spy chip story was ""untrue"" saying it had never found ""modified hardware or malicious chips"" on its systems. The NCSC responded to questions about the alleged spy chip attack by saying it was aware of media reports but had ""no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Apple"". It urged anyone with ""credible intelligence"" about the allegations to get in touch.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Avocado prices at record high due to reduced harvests,"Avocado prices have risen to a record due to surging global demand and reduced harvests from major producers Mexico, Peru and California. A 10-kilogram box of Hass avocados from Mexico's major wholesale producer sells for around 530 pesos (Â£21.78; $27.89). That is more than double last year's price, according to Bloomberg data. Analysts expect prices to remain at ""elevated levels"" after a growers strike in Mexico and drought in California led to a severe supply crunch last year. Mexico supplies 82% of avocado shipments into the US, according to data from the Hass Avocado Board, but that is expected to drop. California production is forecast to be down about 44% this year. Peru has also downgraded this year's crop forecast following severe flooding in its southern growing regions. US shoppers have seen prices rise steeply, but not at the same rate as wholesale prices. Food trend Avocado consumption has grown dramatically after the fruit's taste and health properties turned it into a major food trend. The avocado has the highest protein and oil content of any fruit. It is also believed to help reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease. There are two main varieties of avocado available on the market: Hass and Fuerte. The former make up 95% of all avocados eaten in the US. The US is the world's largest consumer and importer of avocados, but the ""butter fruit"" is also rapidly gaining fans in China. Avocado exports from Latin America to China are growing by about 250% a year, according to the Financial Times. Chinese conglomerate Shenzhen Kondarl is also buying Australia's biggest avocado farm Primary Growth for up to 1bn yuan ($146m) to meet the burgeoning demand. In fact, demand for the fruit is so great there were even avocado thefts in New Zealand during last year's shortage. Major US restaurant chains were also affected. Subway was forced to stop serving fresh avocado on their sandwiches while Chipotle Mexican Grill said it squeezed their bottomline. There are also worries that avocados will get even more expensive if President Trump follows through with his threat to exit NAFTA or levy tariffs on Mexico.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The new iPhone: Your Comments,"Apple shows off iPhone4 I will be buying one when my contract ends for my last iPhone. Why? Because with all this change in technology that I have had from an early age, I now like consistency and reliability. Google Android could even be better, but I don't want to change again. Other companies seem to like redesigning and reinventing the wheel, Apple just keeps making the wheel better. Dave Hacker, Bournemouth, UK I recently switched over to a HTC Incredible running Google Android. Not only is this a better application of Smartphone technology, the service is better through the connection provider. Apple has really lost a great deal of market share through their exclusivity contracts with companies like ATT. Baker Tee, Chicago, Illinois, USA We will surely be buying this latest iteration of the ever popular phone. The addition of the front facing video camera adds a whole new dimension. Although video calling has been around for decades, the iPhone will be responsible for making it ubiquitous. Shweta Kumar, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Perfect timing! I was about to buy a 3GS but will wait the extra two weeks and get the new iPhone 4. It looks awesome Matt Terry, Worthing, UK Should I buy another Apple iPhone? They are joking! I have had problems with mine from the beginning. Also, I'm unable to use it as a memory stick makes the 8GB a waste of money. The most expensive mobile phone mistake I have made. Andrew MacArthur, Fushun, China It looks excellent. As for the ""walled garden"" that has been much criticised, I consider it an important part of what I like about the phone. Our family will end up with five of these. Tim, Southport, Australia Interesting but I have just come back from a meeting which had and iPad in attendance which was much more useful. James Spencer, Manchester, UK It looks pretty but when I replace my current iPhone it will be with an Android handset. I don't like Apple's tight control of content. Mervyn Thomas, Brisbane, Australia Who gives a toss about phones? What a bizarre thing to get excited about. David Jones, Leeds, UK I already have an iPhone and cannot imagine life without it. The new version is a huge improvement and I will definitely buy it. Peter, Brussels Looks like there will be more new iPhones out each year than Manchester United shirts. Ian, Burnham on Sea, UK No, I will not buy one. The battery life is poor compared to other phones like the HTC Desire. I travel a lot and do not want to have to keep charging my phone every night. The Android operating system is fast overtaking the iPhone operating system in functionality: it doesn't tie you to just one manufacturer and you don't pay through your nose for an iconic brand name.

Weald Hall Care Home which owed Â£1m closes at short notice,"June Wrobel, 93, who has dementia, must leave Weald Hall in Wadhurst, East Sussex, by the end of the month. The most recently published accounts for the home show it owed more than Â£1m to creditors, of which Â£350,000 had been due before 31 March this year. The home's owner, Alice Bock, declined to comment to the BBC. Mrs Wrobel's accommodation was costing Â£1,100 per week. In a letter on 12 August Ms Bock told her family the home would close on 31 August. She said she had ""struggled to turn around a home that had been in previous financial difficulties"". Problems with staff recruitment and resident numbers, she said, made its operation ""untenable"", and the short notice period was due to depleted staff numbers making the environment ""unsafe"". 'Shaking a lot' A second letter from the home seen by the BBC warned families that they could face legal action by speaking to journalists. Mrs Wrobel's son, Michael, said she was ""very withdrawn, very agitated, shaking a lot"" and kept saying, ""'I'm worried, what's going to happen to me?"" Her daughter-in-law, Jutta, said: ""Private care homes, where residents pay significant amounts of money, are perhaps not as regulated as state-funded care homes. ""A light needs to be shone in the corners there, to see what is the comeback, where is the duty of care, and how protected are people?"" The family has found Mrs Wrobel a new home, but it is substantially smaller so she is unable to take many of her belongings with her. An planning application from Weald Hall Care Home has been sent to Wealden District Council, requesting permission to knock down the staff accommodation and garage at the back of the home and put in four homes. An East Sussex County Council spokesman said: ""We understand this is a distressing time for residents and their families, and we are doing everything we can to support them and to minimise the disruption following the provider's decision to close the service."" The home's most recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection one year ago found that it ""required improvement"". Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Covid-19: Seven new cases identified on Isle of Man,"Five of the latest positive results were linked to a person who had had a ""significant number of high-risk contacts"" during the New Year's Eve period before testing positive on Saturday evening, the government said. The other two cases were close contacts of people who also tested positive last week. No direct link to other recent clusters of cases has been found. A total of 403 people on the island have tested positive since March and there have been 25 deaths, with 20 of those residents at Abbotswood Nursing Home. There are currently 27 active cases. Director of public health Henrietta Ewart said a number of places had been identified as being visited by one of the new cases, and anyone who was at the locations at the same time should isolate if they developed symptoms. The places of concern are: 'Onward transmission' Dr Ewart said although the current cases are likely to be linked to the previous clusters, health officials would ""never know exactly what that chain of transmission was"" due to the passage of time. She said: ""The focus now needs to be containing and closing onward transmission from the current cases and their contacts, and ensuring that we stop and contain any wider spread into the community."" More than 90 people identified as at-risk contacts of a Douglas Primary school pupil who contracted the virus have now tested negative. Announcing the closure of garden centres and hardware stores to the public from 00:01 GMT on Thursday, Chief Minister Howard Quayle said it was now necessary to ""turn the screws another notch and lockdown a little harder"". He also urged parents to only send their children to the island's hub schools if it was essential. And he said the government could not rule out closing the borders ""at short or no notice"".

McDermott pulls out of race to run City watchdog,"Tracey McDermott later confirmed she had withdrawn from the recruitment process. It leaves the race for the top City regulator's job wide open. Former FCA boss Martin Wheatley left the organisation in September. Since then, the chancellor has reportedly struggled to find a suitable candidate willing to fill the role. George Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""[The FCA] needs new leadership to take it into its more mature phase. We are looking for the best candidate. To be fair, there's a very effective interim leader in Tracey McDermott, but she doesn't want the job full-time."" Ms McDermott confirmed in a statement that she had interviewed for the role on a permanent basis after taking over as interim chief executive in September. In a statement released by the FCA, she said: ""I have been at the FSA/FCA for 15 years and I remain extremely committed to, and passionate about, the important work we do. It has been, and remains, a privilege to lead this organisation. ""However, going through the recruitment process has made me reflect on what I want to do with the rest of my career. ""As a result, I have decided that this is not the right job for me at this stage of my career. This was a decision taken after many months of careful thought and was not one that I took lightly. "" Since Mr Wheatley was ousted as FCA boss by the chancellor in the summer, the regulator has proposed a time limit be set on payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation claims and signalled a lighter touch approach to its regulation of the City. Mr Wheatley was originally hired as boss of the FCA because of his reputation as a tough global financial regulator. But his habit of straight talking led to accusations of banker-bashing by City grandees. Since his departure from the regulator, a major investigation into banking culture, pay and practices, was dropped. The decision to ditch the investigation into banking culture, pay and practices was not received well by MP's when it was announced last month, with the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee Andrew Tyrie calling Ms McDermott and her colleagues before his committee on 20 January. Mark Garnier MP, a Conservative member of the Treasury Select Committee, said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision. And the FCA was later forced to deny the Treasury had been involved in the decision to drop the banking inquiry. It added that a focus on the culture in financial services firms remained a priority, saying: ""We have decided that the best way to support these efforts is to engage individually with firms to encourage their delivery of cultural change, as well as supporting the other initiatives outside the FCA.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
World's biggest opera houses defend ENO after funding cuts,"They described the ENO as ""a showcase for talent and innovation"" and ""one of the UK's greatest cultural ambassadors"" in a letter to the Financial Times. Signatories included Alexander Pereira, of La Scala in Milan, and Peter Gelb, of New York's Metropolitan Opera. The ENO was placed under ""special funding arrangements"" last month. Arts Council England said the organisation must improve its business model or face funding cuts. It had already cut the ENO's funding by 29%, reducing its annual grant cut from Â£17.2m in 2014/15 to Â£12.4m in the next financial year. The global opera scene has now rallied behind the organisation. Senior figures from Russia, the US and Europe said they were ""alarmed"" by recent questions about the ENO and the leadership of its ""talented artistic director"" John Berry. ""Under Berry's strong 10-year leadership, the ENO is today regarded as one of the most creative forces in opera, consistently producing important new work,"" the letter said [subscription required]. ""At a time when it has helped to further embellish London's reputation as a leading centre of cultural creativity, it doesn't seem fair for the ENO to now be under fire."" 'Financial woes' Last month Arts Council England announced it had dropped ENO from its national portfolio of organisations for 2015-18. It said it would review the opera's finances and business plan over the next two years and ""set rigorous milestones"" for progress. High-profile disagreements at the top of the organisation were made public earlier this year, with the Sunday Times publishing a letter from former chairman Martyn Rose in which he called for Berry to be sacked. Rose's departure was announced in January, and executive director Henriette Gotz resigned a few days later. In their letter, however, top directors argued it was ""not the fault of the ENO that it is suffering from the same financial woes that many international opera companies are facing these days."" They said Berry and the company ""should be applauded for their indefatigable efforts to keep our art form fresh"", rather than be criticised. They added: ""We stand together in support of him and his notable achievements."" The ENO has recently moved towards more commercial programming that includes the staging of musical theatre productions such as Sweeney Todd, starring Bryn Terfel and Emma Thompson. It announced on Monday it has appointed Cressida Pollock as its interim chief executive officer. She will work with acting chairman Harry Brunjes from 24 March until the roles are filled permanently.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Reading school teacher jailed over sex with pupil,"Oliver Glass, who taught at St Joseph's College in Reading, groomed the girl before having sex with her on three occasions, Reading Crown Court heard. The ex-head of maths, 33, was sentenced to 22 months in prison after admitting the offences and he will go on the sex offenders register for 10 years. Judge Paul Dugdale described it as one of the ""most serious"" abuse of position of trust cases he has had to deal with. Glass admitted three counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity when he was in a position of trust. The court heard he had sent the girl explicit texts and Snapchat messages, before having sex with her in his car after a school sports day. He went on to have sex with the pupil - who had reached the age of consent - two more times in his car. The University of Oxford graduate was arrested last year after the girl told teachers about their consensual sex. Laura Blackband, prosecuting, told the court: ""He accepted crucially he knew it was against the law."" In a victim impact statement the girl said she now ""struggles to trust men"" and Glass has ""ruined"" the memory of her school years. Sally Howes QC, defending, told the court the father-of-one had been having relationship problems with his wife at the time, and has since shown ""profound and heartfelt remorse and regret"". Sentencing Judge Dugdale said Glass subjecting his victim to ""rough sex"" had made the offences ""particularly unpleasant"". ""You used extraordinarily degrading language towards her, degrading her as a sexual partner, degrading her as a pupil and degrading her as a woman,"" he said. St Joseph's College is an independent day school for boys and girls, aged three to 18, where parents pay up to Â£12,000 a year. In a statement, the headmaster Andrew Colpus said: ""We deeply regret that a former member of staff should have abused his position and betrayed the trust placed in him in such a shocking way, and we applaud his victim for having had the courage to speak out.

Veterans' war memories given life in 'virtual' tour,"Poppyscotland has teamed up with games developers at Abertay University on the unusual Remembrance project. Headsets take users on a simulated tour of the Lady Haig poppy factory in Edinburgh where objects trigger a series of personal stories. Seven veterans provided the soundtrack, sharing their reasons for signing up, stories of battle and friendship. Called Their Memory, the innovative project aims to share poignant, humorous and harrowing accounts with new audiences. The former service personnel who gave up their memories have served their country across various major conflicts. 'Something very special' The project was led by Dr Iain Donald of Abertay's School of Design and Informatics and research assistant Emma Houghton. Dr Donald said: ""As one of the world's leading computer games universities we regularly collaborate on industry-led and charity projects, but Their Memory is something very special. ""We were delighted to be able to work with Poppyscotland and their brave veterans to produce this unique new way of remembering those who gave up their lives in conflict."" The project saw the veterans open up to the Abertay team about what the Poppy and Remembrance mean to them. The immersive experience allows the user to select objects, personal to the veterans, which are laid out in the poppy factory. Items include a poppy, a poppybox, letters and pictures from children, a mortar shell, a model tank, a plane, a copy of an oath, a bullet, a coffee mug from Bosnia and a Nato flag. Once selected by the user, each item triggers a Poppyscotland video or an interview soundtrack of a veteran describing a related memory. Gordon Michie, head of fundraising at Poppyscotland said: ""It is vital that we preserve and share the memories of veterans experiences so that they are understood and recognised for generations to come. ""Poppyscotland strives to be innovative in the way in which we do this and utilising the latest virtual reality technology allows us to both reach new audiences and provide them with a truly immersive, memorable experience."" The next stage of the project is to secure further funding to explore how it can be used. The current version is due to be released on the Oculus Go virtual reality platform.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pakistan blasphemy: Gunman shoots accused dead in court,"By Secunder KermaniBBC News, Islamabad He had been facing charges for allegedly claiming to be a prophet. Blasphemy is legally punishable by death. No-one has been executed for it by the state but accusations can often lead to violent attacks. The victim, Tahir Ahmad Naseem, was accused of blasphemy in 2018 by a teenager. He was killed at a trial hearing on Wednesday morning. Video shared on social media shows his body slumped over the court's seats. His attacker was arrested at the scene. Another video shows him in handcuffs, shouting angrily that his victim was an ""enemy of Islam"". Mr Naseem was first accused of blasphemy by Awais Malik, a madrassa student from Peshawar. Mr Naseem had struck up an online conversation with him whilst living in the United States. Mr Malik told the BBC he had then met Mr Naseem in a shopping mall in Peshawar to discuss his views on religion, after which he filed a case against him with the police. He said he had not been present at court, and had no knowledge of the shooting. The suspect arrested for the killing has been named as Khalid. It is not clear how he managed to bring a weapon into the court premises. Mr Naseem was born into the persecuted Ahmadi sect, according to a spokesman for the community. But he added that he had left the sect and claimed to be a prophet himself. The community leader suggested Mr Naseem had been mentally ill - he had uploaded videos to YouTube claiming to be a messiah. Human rights groups say Pakistan's hardline blasphemy laws disproportionately target minority communities and encourage vigilante attacks. Dozens of people accused of being blasphemers have been killed by angry mobs or militants in recent years. In an unrelated development, a hashtag campaign accusing a user of committing blasphemy has been trending on Twitter in the country. But other users, concerned about the individual's safety, have been actively trying to drown out the accusations, using a separate hashtag -#btsarmypakistan - a reference to fans of the extremely popular Korean pop group BTS. One of those involved in the counter-trend told the BBC it was an attempt to ""resist right-wing trolls taking over the internet and possibly killing someone in the process"". Hashtags related to BTS were also used during recent Black Lives Matter protests in the US to drown out racist online counter-campaigns.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Arson arrest of boy, 15, as dogs killed in Manchester kennels fire","Police said the number of animals that have died is expected to rise. Four crews were at the scene of the blaze, which broke out at about 19:00 BST in Moss Brook Road in Harpurhey. Firefighters said the fire is now out and are asking members of the public who want to help to stay away while the other dogs are still being rescued. Paul Duggan, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""Unfortunately about a third of the kennels have been badly affected by fire. ""Over 40 dogs have been killed or confirmed as deceased."" ""Thankfully due to the intervention of the firefighters, they've actually stopped the fire spreading, and we understand that over 150 dogs have been saved and removed from the site."" Anna Stansfield, manager of Cheshire Dogs Home, described the blaze as ""soul destroying"" and added all the rescued dogs would be transferred to its site in Cheshire. ""I cannot describe what we have seen tonight. It's soul destroying. ""We are so grateful to the people of Manchester and Greater Manchester who have come to support us but we need to get the roads clear so we can get the dogs out."" 'Atrocious sights' Supt Marcus Noden, of Greater Manchester Police, confirmed a ""young boy"" was in custody and appealed for people to contact police ""if anyone was in the area and remembers seeing anything suspicious around the dogs' home"". ""As a dog owner myself I understand that many people will feel angry and upset about what has happened but I would ask that they let the police carry out their investigations and not take matters into their own hands. ""We have received an overwhelming response from the public and would ask if anyone wants to help they can make donations of food or bedding to North Manchester divisional headquarters on Northampton Road in Newton Heath."" Following the fire the Manchester Dogs' Home released a statement saying staff and trustees ""would like to express their enormous gratitude for the huge support received from the public following the devastating fire"". ""All of the surviving dogs are now in transit - the majority of them going to sister site Cheshire Dogs' Home near Warrington - and those in need of veterinary treatment have been receiving it."" It said the Home had been inundated with messages of support and those wishing to make a donation could use the justgiving.com website. It also thanked other charities which ""stepped in immediately to help"". The statement also expressed the gratitude of the trustees towards its staff ""many of whom witnessed atrocious sights"" as they dealt with the fire and its aftermath. The home was established in 1893 and cares for more than 7,000 dogs every year. It is run entirely on donations from the general public.

Does Russian-language Siri have a problem with gays?,"By BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why A video posted earlier this week showing a conversation in Russian between Siri and a man who identifies himself as Alex has now been widely shared on YouTube and Reddit. Here's a translation: Alex: ""Siri, gay clubs around me? Siri: ""I would have turned red (blushed) if I could."" Alex: ""How to register a gay marriage in the UK?"" Siri: [Silence] Alex: ""How to register a gay marriage in the UK?"" Siri: ""I will pretend I haven't heard it."" You get the idea. Apple says Siri's responses were the result of a bug that has since been fixed. But the online discussion in English reflected the fact that gay rights and homophobia in Russia are now an issue very much discussed in the outside world. There was an assumption that Siri had been deliberately set up this way to comply with Russian law. ""Apple is required to conform to the law of the land in order to sell devices in a place. Recognizing that is realism, not cynicism,"" said one Reddit user. Comments in Russian were much more angry in tone - some homophobic and others questioning Western interest in the subject. Alex, who's originally from Russia but now lives in the UK, told BBC Trending that he discovered Russian Siri's ""attitude"" by accident. ""I was out with friends who'd updated their phones to the latest version of iOS,"" he said. ""Russian Siri was one of the new features available. So we made queries using the word 'gay' and got very weird replies. We also got similar responses with the word 'lesbian',"" he says. A BBC Russian team asked Siri similar questions and got the same response. You can read their article about it (in Russian) here. Gay rights are a contentious subject in Russia, after a law banning gay ""propaganda"" was passed in 2013. It prohibits people from giving information about homosexuality to those under 18. ""I can understand if a company needs to adapt to the legislation of a country,"" says Alex. ""Apple fixed it. But there hasn't been an explanation as to how it happened in the first place.""

Rolf Harris conviction: Australia reacts to star's fall,"Jon DonnisonSydney correspondent The trial has received widespread coverage here and has often been front page news. The verdict came too late for the most of the Australian newspapers but the tabloid Sydney Daily Telegraph ran with a simple one word headline ""GUILTY."" Although Harris left Australia for England in 1952, he now faces the possibility of further charges being brought here. 'Octopus' During the trial several Australian women came forward alleging that Harris molested them during return visits to his country of birth. Two radio presenters say Harris groped them following interviews. Verity James, a radio host in Perth says Harris assaulted her following an interview in 2000. She says the man she calls ""the octopus"" pushed her up against a wall, grabbed her buttocks and rubbed her breasts. A second journalist Jane Marwick alleges she was groped as she posed for a photograph with Harris after an interview in 2001. Neither woman has said whether they will press charges here. One Australian woman Tonya Lee, who waived her right to anonymity, was one of those who took the case to trial in the UK. She told the court Harris assaulted her on a ""dream"" trip to London with a youth theatre group in 1986. She said Harris invited her to sit on his knee in a pub then sexually abused her. She says he then attacked her again outside the pub bathroom. For older Australians Harris was one of the country's best known exports, a household name. Despite living in the UK, he was a regular face on Australian television during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. He was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association's Hall of Fame. Until last year his famous musical wobble board sat in Australia's National Museum in Canberra. 'Sinister pervert' But many of the younger generation will tell you, until this case, they'd never heard of him. Rolf Harris was born in the Perth suburb of Bassendean in 1930. His parents had emigrated to Australia from Wales. ""The boy from Bassendean"", as he was known, is honoured with a plaque inlaid into one of the city's footpaths. There are now plans to dig it up. That ""boy"" has now been labelled a ""sinister pervert"" by the prosecution. He caused controversy in Australia in 2008 after he said Aboriginals should stop ""complaining about poverty"" and ""get off their arse"" to ""clean up the streets."" But generally, until this case, Harris's image had been squeaky clean. A poll taken in the Australian Reader's Digest before this case emerged listed him as among the country's top hundred most trusted people. Few will trust him now.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US envoy Susan Rice admits Benghazi attack error,"UN Ambassador Susan Rice said there had been no attempt to mislead the public, but Republicans were unconvinced. After meeting Ms Rice on Tuesday, senators said they were troubled. The envoy said her initial line that the Benghazi attack appeared to have sprung from a protest had been wrong. The 11 September assault on the US consulate triggered a major political row over who knew what and when. Days afterwards, Ms Rice, 48, said in a series of TV interviews that it seemed to have developed out of protests over an anti-Islamic film. Later intelligence reports suggested it was possibly tied to al-Qaeda affiliates. The attack left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. 'Disturbed' On Tuesday, Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte met privately with Ms Rice and acting CIA Director Michael Morell to discuss the attack. After the meeting on Capitol Hill, Ms Rice said: ""The talking points provided by the intelligence community, and the initial assessment upon which they were based, were incorrect in a key respect: there was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi. ""While we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack, as is often the case the intelligence assessment has evolved."" But the Republicans said questions remained unanswered. Sen McCain said: ""We are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got and some that we didn't get concerning evidence that was leading up to the attack."" Sen Graham said that he was ""more disturbed now than I was before"", adding that he would ""absolutely"" attempt to block any nomination of Ms Rice for secretary of state. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Tuesday there were ""no unanswered questions"" about Ms Rice's response to the Benghazi incident, accusing Republicans of being obsessed with it. Republicans are demanding a joint committee investigate the attack. Current Secretary of State Clinton is not expected to continue in the role for a second four-year term. The Obama administration would need the support of the Senate for any nomination to the post. After winning re-election, President Barack Obama vigorously defended Ms Rice, calling Republican criticism of her ""outrageous"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ex-schools mental health champion criticises axing of role,"Natasha Devon told BBC Newsnight that she had wanted to give young people a voice at government level. The loss of her role came after she had used a head teachers' conference to stress the level of mental strain being put on pupils by rigorous testing. But the Department for Education denied the role was cut to silence criticism. It said an ""independent NHS task force report"" published in February had ""recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created"", which had forced it to reconsider Ms Devon's role. 'Mental health crisis' Ms Devon, who took up the post last August, told BBC Newsnight: ""When I first took the role, I said to the department what I want to do is... bring the concerns of young people and the people who teach them to government level. ""So it's not actually me that's being silenced, it's young people and teachers. ""I think the government knows that young people don't vote, or if they do they are very unlikely to vote Tory, and they have historically ignored their needs and the price they have paid is now we have seen a crisis in their mental health."" Ms Devon, who was made a MBE in 2015 for her work helping young people conquer mental health and body image issues, said she had not been paid for the role as it was important she remained independent and objective. She warned the new, paid mental-health champion could ""be paid effectively to toe the party line"". She said she hoped the new champion would be a ""positive force for good"", but she was ""sceptical"". 'Great job' In a statement, the Department for Education said: ""Natasha has done a great job of helping us to raise the profile of young people's mental health since her appointment last year. ""We have asked Natasha and others who have been involved in our work to empower schools and young people to promote good mental health to continue to work with us as we prepare to launch our activity later this year.""

Valve shuts down money laundering via CS:GO game,"In a statement, it said the game had been targeted by global cyber-criminals looking to ""liquidate their gains"". The thieves exploited the game's loot-gathering systems, which allow players to trade keys and unlock rewards for real cash. Valve said it had updated the game so keys could no longer be traded online. Fraud-sourced Video game CS:GO pits two teams against each other on a small map. Their task is to try to eliminate each other and carry out other objectives such as protecting hostages or planting a bomb. Figures from Valve suggest the game had more than 18 million unique players last month. While playing CS:GO, gamers could earn loot boxes containing cosmetic upgrades for their avatars or weapons. The only way to open the loot containers was to buy a key from Valve. Both boxes and keys could be traded for real cash on the Steam marketplace. Valve said until recently keys were generally traded between real players. But now this had changed as fraudsters had targeted the game. ""At this point, nearly all key purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be fraud-sourced,"" it said. It is not clear how much money was being laundered via the Steam marketplace but hundreds of thousands of boxes and keys have been traded via the online shop. Most keys and boxes sell for a few dollars each. Players will still be able to buy keys to open containers they get via gameplay, said Valve. Following the latest update to the game, keys will be bound to a player's account so they cannot be transferred. It admitted that the change would hit some legitimate players but said its desire to combat fraud came first. Writing on the Rock Paper Shotgun gaming news site, Craig Pearson said the keys were used by fraudsters because they had a ""consistent price"" across Steam. This, he said, let ""traders, both legitimate and heinous, use them as a base currency"". Fraudsters are expected to target trading in other Valve games such as Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, he added. Valve has taken action several times to limit use and abuse of the CS:GO trading system. It has limited trading in the past when it emerged that some traders were, in effect, using items as gambling chips. It has also stopped players in the Netherlands and Belgium opening loot boxes following rulings that that mechanism violated local gambling laws.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Students 'worst' at e-book piracy, says data monitor","By Chi Chi IzunduNewsbeat entertainment reporter NetNames says its investigators looked at the availability of 50 popular textbooks across five different disciplines in the UK. In total, 76% of the titles were available to download free in pirated form on one e-book sharing site. NetNames says publishers are trying to beat piracy by getting their content out to users as quickly as they can. Science and engineering were the most pirated academic textbooks. NetNames' director of piracy analysis, David Price, says the expense of educational books could be the problem. ""It's something we've been talking to publishers about,"" he said. ""We talk to all content owners about this sort of thing. The best way to beat piracy is to get your content out there, to give it to people in some way or make them buy it in some simple, cheap, easy way."" Nineteen-year-old student Jubel Amin, who's studying pharmacology and physiology, says textbooks are extremely expensive. He says he had to buy two and that they cost him in excess of Â£180. ""The thing is these books will last us for three years, so it is worth it in the long run,"" he said. ""But it's quite expensive. It took about a fifth of my student finance loan, but it's one of those things you have to do I guess."" Author Samantha Shannon, 21, is being called the next JK Rowling because of her new book, The Bone Season. She completed her English degree earlier this year and says getting access to texts online the legal way is easy. ""It is difficult as some people really want to read the book but can't afford to, but as an author you are selling something and it's what you live on quite often,"" she said. ""If I wanted a bracelet in a shop I couldn't just take it."" The research has been released as the Publishers Association admitted that e-book piracy was a growing problem. The organisation's chief executive, Richard Mollet, says it's not all the students' fault. ""We're seeing more infringement of e-books as the digital market grows,"" he said. ""About a quarter of all novels bought in the UK are bought as e-books, so as that digital market grows, we're bound to see a little bit of piracy alongside it. ""But I have to say, it's a very small issue compared with the sort of levels we see in film and music. E-books are nowhere near that."" Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter",Human,English,BBC,,,1
NI Assembly election: Former submariner Steve Aiken surfaces at Stormont,"By Mervyn JessBBC News NI For some it was a return to the familiar, while for others it was akin to first day at school. Twenty-nine MLAs will take up seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time after last week's election. Among them is a former commander of a nuclear-powered submarine. Steve Aiken was elected for the Ulster Unionist Party in South Antrim. The Ballyclare man featured in a BBC television documentary 11 years ago about his last tour of duty in command of a Royal Navy sub. At that time a career in politics was the last thing on his mind. But as he found himself with his party colleagues posing for photographs on the steps of Stormont, it was clear it is now a reality. ""I feel quite humble and quite privileged,"" he said. ""It's a magnificent building with a magnificent bunch of people in it ""It's a fantastic day and we've had a great opportunity to talk to each other and get ready for the forthcoming business ahead of us."" With a naval career spent under the waves living in close proximity to the rest of the crew, the experience of walking through the revolving doors of Stormont into the much less confined space of the Great Hall was a major transition for the former sub commander. ""It's extraordinary the sense of space and light that we have in the building here, whereas in a submarine it was somewhat more constrained. ""The great thing about Parliament Buildings is also the people. That's what made submarine service such a great thing."" Mr Aiken says he is looking forward to entering into the assembly chamber and debating the issues that matter to him and his constituents. ""There's a lot of things we need to be working towards - improving the economy, education and the health system,"" he said. ""And we actually need to see how we're going to get some joined-up government for once."" There is one major difference for the former submariner - when he was a Royal Navy commander he had absolute power on board. So how does that sit with him now having to deal with a party leader, other MLAs and the politics of persuasion? ""It's an enormous mind-shift for a submariner. ""However, nobody ever talks about the five years I spent in Whitehall doing battle with the Treasury. ""The opportunity to take some of those skills and build them into what we're doing now is great,"" he added. As a naval commander, Mr Aiken was answerable to his immediate superiors and now he has a constituency to answer to. ""The people I am now answerable to are those living in south Antrim,"" he said. ""The election count was the first I'd ever attended and to see all those votes coming in with a number one against the name Aiken made me suddenly realise I'd an awful responsibility for those people.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"A&E facing serious problem, health minister admits","Rising attendances have meant A&E units in England have started struggling to hit the four-hour waiting time target. The problem has got so bad that NHS England has pledged extra money to help hospitals that are struggling. But Health Minister Anna Soubry warned there would be ""no quick and easy solution"". She said: ""We have a serious problem, we've had a problem for a while. ""If you look at the number of people presenting to A&E it's grown by a million in just the last year. ""And unfortunately unless we take urgent action, which we've been doing, it's a problem which will grow. It's very complicated. There is no quick and easy solution."" In recent months reports have emerged of hospitals setting up temporary waiting areas in car parks and storerooms to cope with queues. Ambulances have also been forced to wait to drop off patients. 'Market failure' The situation prompted the Care Quality Commission to issue a stark warning about the future of A&E. CQC chairman David Prior said: ""Emergency admissions through accident and emergency are out of control in large parts of the country. That is totally unsustainable."" He added that there was no cast-iron guarantee that there would not be a repeat of the situation at Stafford Hospital. Mr Prior is also reported to have suggested the large-scale closure of hospital beds and investment in community services. He added: ""The patient or resident is the weakest voice in the system. It is a classic market failure. The user doesn't know nearly as much as the professionals, even with the internet."" Mr Prior is not alone in proposing a radical shake-up of A&E services. The College of Emergency Medicine, which represents casualty department doctors, believes that between 15% and 30% of patients admitted could be treated elsewhere. Soon after the CQC warning was made, NHS England announced it was asking regional health bosses to work together to ensure plans are in place for each A&E in their patch by the end of the month. Extra money is being made available where problems are identified. Prof Keith Willett, of NHS England, said: ""When pressure builds across the health and social care system, the symptoms are usually found in the A&E department. ""We need the whole NHS system, in the community and hospitals, to recognise the problems and help to relieve the pressure on their colleagues in A&E."" A review, led by medical director Sir Bruce Keogh, is already under way to address the issues in the long term.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Garda chief fears false data 'not confined to traffic',"Her speech was circulated to committee members on Wednesday. Last week, it emerged almost one million drink-driving tests recorded by police did not actually take place. An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) also admitted an error that caused almost 15,000 wrongful traffic convictions. 'Outrageous facts' Commissioner O'Sullivan is to give evidence to the Oireachtas (parliamentary) Committee on Justice and Equality on Thursday. She will face questions over revelations on fixed charge notices and breathalyser test figures. At the weekend, Ms O'Sullivan said revelations over penalty points and breath test discrepancies are ""unacceptable"". She said on Saturday that the police service was on a journey of radical reform and ""it is inevitable that we will identify more examples of bad practice"". CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in of Sinn FÃ©in, who chairs the Justice and Equality Committee, said members wanted assurances ""that there can be no repeat of these outrageous facts"". On Tuesday, the government announced it was planning two separate investigations. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny announced an independent review of the overall operation of the force. 'Financial irregularities' A second investigation will probe the wrongful convictions of almost 15,000 motorists, and apparent false data on breath tests. Mr Kenny also said on Tuesday that the government continues to have confidence in Commissioner O'Sullivan. She was already facing questions over her leadership because of allegations of a smear campaign against a whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe. Sgt McCabe was one of two officers who raised concerns years ago about the alleged deletion of penalty points from the driving licences of well-connected offenders. Speaking during Leaders' Questions in the DÃ¡il (parliament), Mr Kenny said of the independent review: ""We continue to see a list of unacceptable revelations about the operation of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na. ""The government believes that the level of public concern is now so profound that it's now time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent, root-and-branch review of An Garda Siochana."" Exact details of the independent review are to be outlined next week. In the meantime, an external inquiry is being set up into the erroneous Garda statistics and prosecutions. Separately, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na is to publish a report on financial irregularities at its training college. The force's internal audit section examined financial transactions over a number of years at the college in Templemore, County Tipperary. Its report revealed that money was being spent on gifts and entertainment, and identified a non-transparent system of accounting. Commissioner O'Sullivan said that while the accounting practices would not be acceptable by today's standards, there was no misappropriation of money or misuse of public funds. TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Frances Fitzgerald told the DÃ¡il on Tuesday that the report raises serious governance issues and will be referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fresh plans for Torfaen's 'British' site,"The 1,300 acre (526 hectares) brownfield site at Talywain, near Pontypool, called ""The British"" has been derelict for 30 years. In June 2007 a development company bought it to build houses on, but the business failed two years later. Torfaen council said it was in talks with the Welsh government and site owners HSBC over a joint venture. The council said the plans could secure the reclamation and redevelopment of the piece of land. The local authority's cabinet will be asked next Tuesday to approve further discussions between council officers, the Welsh government and the banking group. Leader of Torfaen council Bob Wellington said: ""The British is the largest remaining site of industrial dereliction in south-east Wales and the inability of the private sector to secure its development has been demonstrated since 2004."" The council said the proposal would make the brownfield site safe by removing existing hazards, including mines and voids and treating contaminated ground. There are plans to remove coal from about 100 acres (40 hectares) , or roughly the size of 40 rugby pitches, by means of opencast mining for up to five years. Mr Wellington added: ""Our proposal to HSBC demonstrates that an arrangement with the public sector has the potential to give the bank a fair return on its investment and achieve the council's aim to regenerate the area and reclaim the site for the community. ""If the public sector does not intervene there is a real danger that the site could remain in its existing state for the foreseeable future."" Create jobs The long-term proposal includes road improvements, a primary school, community facilities, shops, open spaces and homes. It could also create jobs and new investment, said the local authority. Gwyneira Clark, the local councillor and executive member for housing, planning and public protection, said: ""We have a small window of opportunity to create a new community in the north of the borough and at the same time create community facilities and make use of the considerable heritage features. ""Public meetings and road shows will be held and volunteers invited to join the community liaison group, an approach which proved successful on the Garn Lakes reclamation scheme in Blaenavon."" The scheme would need the final approval of the council.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Boohoo warned over advertising real fur as fake,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint it received about a pom pom jumper being sold by the online retailer. Tests by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) found it contained real fur - likely to have come from a rabbit. Boohoo said it had a strong commitment against the sale of real fur. The ASA said it received a complaint from HSI, who claimed the advert was misleading. The charity had bought the faux fur pom pom jumper and commissioned a test which revealed it contained real animal fur. Boohoo said it had ""robust"" policies and procedures in place to ensure it didn't sell real fur products. It said it had received the jumpers from a supplier who was ""aware of Boohoo's commitment against the sale of real fur and had signed a supplier acknowledgement form committing to not supplying products containing real fur"". Boohoo also said it got its quality control team to inspect a proportion of its stock that contained faux fur. A sample of the same pom pom jumper that HSI tested was tested by Boohoo and recorded as having passed the internal checks. Boohoo removed the advert once the complaint was received and also stopped placing orders with the supplier who gave them the jumpers. The ASA ruled that the advert was misleading and ""must not appear again in the form complained about"". It added: ""We told Boohoo.com UK Ltd not to state that products included 'faux fur', if that was not the case."" Claire Bass, executive director of HSI UK, said: ""It's completely unacceptable that compassionate consumers setting out to buy fake fur are being misled into buying animal fur. ""These two examples are the latest in a long list of 'fake faux fur' items we've found for sale, so we hope that the ASA's rulings will send a strong message to the industry and make retailers work harder to give consumers confidence in avoiding cruel animal fur.""

New electric trains approved after windscreens changed,"Train drivers' union Aslef had said the curved windscreen on the Class 385s were causing reflections of other signals at night. New flat windscreens will now be fitted to all 70 of the trains. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has confirmed the Hitachi trains are safe and licensed to carry passengers. ScotRail has ordered 46 three-carriage and 24 four-carriage sets of the 385 trains to run between Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as on suburban routes south of Glasgow and to Dunblane, Stirling and Alloa. They form part of the Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme, which has been introducing electrification to the line. The first of the Hitachi trains was due to have entered service in September last year but manufacturing hitches and delays to electrification of the line meant this date was not met. Train operator ScotRail has been forced to lease extra train to make up for the delays. The new electric trains could now begin to be rolled into service by the end of the summer. Reduced journey times The Japanese manufacturer and ScotRail have claimed the improved acceleration of the Class 385s will reduce journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh to 42 minutes as well as increasing capacity. The ORR approval also includes a formal acceptance of the new flat windscreens for the trains, which was accepted by Aslef in May. The new windscreens are being fitted on trains that are already in Scotland in Springburn, with the remainder of the work carried out at Hitachi's County Durham factory. Andy Radford, programme manager at Hitachi Rail, said: ""Getting the green light for new trains is a massive milestone for the project. ""It has been achieved by all parties involved working collaboratively towards the same goal. ""It is now all systems go so that Scottish commuters can start enjoying the benefits of this modern fleet. ScotRail project manager Gary Brown said: ""The new trains have been declared safe and fit to run, which is great news for our customers. ""It means we're one step closer to delivering more seats, faster journeys and better services, not just in the Central Belt, but across Scotland.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UN: World's forests fundamental to human well-being,"By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter, BBC News Eva Mueller, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Forestry Division, said trees provided a direct source of food, fuel and income. Commenting on the findings of the UN's State of the World's Forest report, she added forests habitats were home to an estimated 80% of global biodiversity. The report has been published at a UN forestry meeting in Rome, Italy. She added: ""Food from the forests - like fruit, nuts, mushrooms, leaves, roots, insects and wild animals - often contributes a nutritious supplement to rural people and provides a safety net in times of hardship. ""Forests, trees, farms and agroforestry systems contribute to food security, nutrition and livelihoods in several ways including as a direct source of food, fuel, employment and income,"" Ms Mueller explained. ""They are fundamental to the survival of forest dwellers, including indigenous people. The report, which was published at the start of the UN's World Forest Week, said that it was time for the sector to shift its focus from ""trees to people"". Knowledge gap It stated: ""State of the World's Forests (SOFO) 2014 argues that this will enable the development of the socioeconomic benefits from forests to meet the growing demands of society, while maintaining the integrity of the forest resource base. ""Across the world, forests, trees on farms, and agroforestry systems play a crucial role in the livelihoods of rural people by providing employment, energy, nutritious foods and a wide range of other goods and ecosystem services. ""They have tremendous potential to contribute to sustainable development and to a greener economy. Yet, clear evidence of this has been lacking."" In the findings, the report's authors said income from the formal forestry sector accounted for about 0.9% of the global economy. However, the informal income (from woodfuel, construction materials, food etc) took forests' contributions to about 1.1% of the global economy. In employment terms, the formal sector provided 13.2 million jobs, while an estimated 41 million livelihoods were dependent on the informal sector. The report also outlined the importance of forests' contribution to food and nutrition security. In 2011, it observed, about 10.9kg of edible non-wood forest products (NWFP) were consumed per capita globally. As a fuel, it estimated that one-in-three of the world's population depended on woodfuel for cooking, while 764 million people used woodfuel for boiling drinking water. Ms Mueller added forests also played an important role indirectly in people's well-being. ""Forests are important providers of ecosystem services,"" she said. "" For example, they help to deliver clean water by protecting water sheds and water courses. ""For most of the year, herders in arid and semi-arid lands depend on trees as a source of fodder for their livestock. ""As habitat for an estimated 80% of the world's biodiversity, forests provide genetic material important for crop and animal improvement, and are home to many pollinator species.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hollywood actor Jason Statham shoots SAS movie in Wales,"The Killer Elite is reportedly based on a book by explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes about the murder of SAS soldiers. Scenes featuring Statham were shot in the Brecon Beacons on Wednesday, and artificial snow was used to create a wintry scene in the middle of summer. Part of Cardiff city centre has also been cordoned off for filming. Sir Ranulph's book, called The Feather Men, is thought to be based on real events, and describes how four British soldiers, including two members of the Special Air Service (SAS), were murdered by a hit squad. The regiment is understood to train in the Brecon Beacons, and that is thought to be one of the reasons why it was chosen as a location for the movie. Artificial snow was laid in an area known as Pont ar Daf, between Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil, by the film crew on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a street off one of Cardiff's main shopping areas has been cordoned off for filming on Thursday. Barriers have been placed across Windsor Place off Queen Street. Samantha Games of Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said films brought benefits to small communities. She added: ""There are so many outstanding and diverse landscapes in the Brecon Beacons that we always try and go out of our way to promote them to location managers and film companies looking for something unique. ""Film productions bring many benefits to small communities in national parks and The Killer Elite is a feature film production which we welcome to the Brecon Beacons. It's no secret that the SAS train in the wilds of Wales, so it made perfect sense to use the Brecon Beacons to film some of the film's key shots."" Ms Games thanked the film's production company which has ""taken great care to respect this protected landscape"". Edwin Harris, chairman of the Brecon Beacons Commoners' Association and the Welsh Commons Forum, said: ""We are delighted that people appreciate the beauty and worth of the landscape we work on and care for. ""We would like to welcome more filming to the Brecon Beacons and look forward to working with the national park authority on future projects, including the work that we, the graziers do to manage this landscape.""

Cancer fight 'hampered in UK by stiff upper lip',"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Researchers, who surveyed nearly 20,000 adults in six high-income countries, said they found embarrassment often stopped Britons visiting the doctor. Respondents in the UK were as aware of cancer symptoms as those in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more reluctant to seek help, they said. A third feared wasting a doctor's time. One in six of the men and women aged 50-and-over surveyed in the UK was embarrassed about sharing their symptoms with a doctor, the researchers from King's College London and University College London, with help from Cancer Research UK and Ipsos Mori, found. They said, in the British Journal of Cancer, that this may partly explain why the UK has a far lower cancer survival rate than other developed nations, despite good access to skilled medical staff and cutting-edge treatments. The researchers surveyed people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland. 'UK phenomenon' Data shows that for cancer survival, the UK ranks behind many countries, including the five other nations looked at in the study. According to estimates, the lives of more than 5,000 cancer patients could be saved each year in England alone if the country matched the best European survival rates. Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley pledged to achieve this target by the next general election in 2015, with the government's cancer strategy. Lead researcher Dr Lindsay Forbes said: ""This is a real UK phenomenon. UK people really stood out in our study. ""As a nation we are much more likely to say we are embarrassed about going to the doctor or we are worried that we will take up a doctor's time. ""We don't know why British people feel like that. It may be that we are more stoic and have a war-time mentality. ""We know that older people in particular can get a symptom and then wait for weeks or months before going to see their doctor."" Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said the charity ""and others are working hard to understand and address these potential barriers to early presentation and encourage people to tell their doctor if they have noticed something different about their body"". ""More work also needs to be done to tackle the poor awareness that cancer risk increases with age,"" she added. The researchers note that Denmark also ranks relatively low for cancer survival. They suspect this could be due to delays in patients accessing timely hospital care - something which may also apply to the UK to some extent.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Bangladesh mass prayer event prompts alarm,"Local police chief Tota Miah told AFP news agency that 10,000 Muslims had gathered in Raipur town to pray ""healing verses"" from the Koran. But some eyewitnesses told the BBC the figure was closer to 30,000. A similar religious event in Malaysia in February has been confirmed as the source of more than 500 infections. That event, which was attended by 16,000 people, has also led to confirmed cases in neighbouring Brunei, Singapore and Cambodia, as people how attended travelled home. Malaysia's government later banned all public gatherings in the country and locked down its borders to prevent the further spread of the virus. A similar mass religious gathering in Indonesia was cancelled at the last minute this week. Prayer and protection The religious event at Raipur in Lakshmipur district came as Bangladesh confirmed its first death due to the virus. So far 17 people in the country have tested positive, although many experts are sceptical over the official figures. Mr Miah said organisers did not get permission from the authorities to hold the event - though such local gatherings in Bangladesh often do not rely on getting official permits. BBC Bengali's correspondent Akbar Hossain spoke to locals who said the event was organised by an influential local religious leader in the small town. He had urged people to join him in praying for protection, and after the event, told people that they would now be ""free from the coronavirus"". Our correspondent says that the southern part of Bangladesh is particularly religious, with people there ""passionately believing that Islamic sermons and prayer are able to solve their problems"". According to the Dhaka Tribune newspaper, the prayers performed were that of the Six Quranic Verses of Healing. Mass outbreak fears In Indonesia, a mass religious gathering due to be held over three days, 19-22 March, has been cancelled. Authorities had for days tried to persuade organisers not to go ahead with the event, for fear that it would lead to a mass outbreak. On Thursday, organisers finally agreed to cancel, but by that time, around 10,000 people - 474 of them people from abroad - had already made their way to Gowa, a regency in the province of South Sulawesi. Provincial authorities told local media outlets that there were plans to quarantine foreign nationals in local hotels for 14 days. They also said they were reaching out to officials in other provinces to make sure the local participants would be quarantined upon their return home. None of the participants have so far been confirmed to have the virus, but the country now has a national total of 309 confirmed cases, with 25 deaths.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh Rugby Union pumps record Â£22.1m into game despite profit fall,"Figures for the Six Nations-winning year ending June 2013 showed the record Â£63m turnover from 12 months earlier had fallen to Â£61m. Pre-tax profits were Â£2.3m compared to Â£2.4m in 2012 and while its debt rose slightly, the WRU is aiming to be debt-free by 2021. It said the results were ""remarkable"". Group chief executive Roger Lewis said financial and operational changes made in 2006 had put the business on firm foundations in challenging economic times. He added: ""It costs money to fund radical change and nurture development so I am delighted that we have again been able to deliver meaningful and record levels of financial support within our priority areas of elite rugby, the community game and the Millennium Stadium. ""It is also a tribute to our success and our reputation that we are able to attract key executive staff of the calibre of Josh Lewsey as head of rugby and Mark Williams to become Millennium Stadium manager to join our outstanding executive board."" The WRU also said there were 2,000 new junior players involved in the game. But the report said senior club-level participation ""continues to be a challenge"" and the four regions ""have yet to achieve their potential either on or off the field"". Player departures In 18 seasons there has only been one appearance by a Welsh club in the Heineken Cup final. In December last year, former Wales wing Adrian Hadley said Wales' rugby regions ""just aren't good enough"" to succeed in the competition. The four regions have also been hit by a series of high-profile player departures in the past year. Some of the biggest Wales stars are based outside the country including former Scarlets player George North, who is now with Northampton, and former Cardiff Blues centre Jamie Roberts, who is with Paris side Racing Metro. The report pointed out that the Millennium Stadium had hosted 11 international football games during the London 2012 Olympics, along with this year's Speedway grand prix and the Rihanna concert. Mr Lewis added: ""Soon we will welcome the rugby league World Cup opening ceremony and matches to the stadium and we are already beginning to plan for the [eight] Rugby World Cup games we will host in 2015. ""These are great times for Wales and we are delighted to be playing our part in making this a great nation to be part of.""

China: Limited victory for man in transgender dismissal case,"Mr C, who was born female but identifies and dresses as a man, was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year when he was fired. The court said he had been illegally dismissed, but said there was not enough evidence to rule he had been fired due to discrimination against transgender people. Mr C told AFP news agency that he was ""quite happy"" with the outcome. But he said that the court's decision to reject discrimination as the cause showed that ""legislation in this field requires greater attention"". Mr C had only worked at the Ciming Health Check-up Centre for a week when he was told to leave. He says it was because he wore men's clothing. A news report at the time quoted a manager as saying that his appearance ""really didn't fit our standards"". The court awarded him a month's wages, reports said. Mr C took the case to court after losing a complaint at a labour tribunal. Speaking to the BBC last year, Mr C said he had received a lot of support from China's LGBT community. But he said trying to find a job as a transgender person was hard. ""Within the LGBT community, many people have experienced this after they revealed their sexual orientation,"" he said. ""So you either hide it, and wear their uniforms, or you get rejected."" Conservative attitudes to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues hold sway in China, which does not allow same-sex marriage. But activists have become more vocal in recent years. Last year, a court in Changsha city ruled that two gay men could not register as married. Supporters said the fact that the case was heard at all constituted progress. 'Limited victory' - Celia Hatton, BBC Asia analyst When Mr C's wrongful dismissal case was first accepted by a district court, activists were pleased that his complaint was being taken seriously. That was a victory unto itself, they said. There was talk that the case could be a legal landmark; a decision that Mr C experienced unfair bias based on his transgender status could set a precedent to protect the labour rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people in China. In the end the court's ruling was a limited victory - awarding Mr C compensation but not ruling that he was dismissed because of his transgender status. China's courts are not independent, and a politically sensitive case like this would have attracted the attention of the country's central authorities. The decision effectively takes the steam out of Mr C's battle. If he had lost, he probably could have appealed, bringing the case to a higher court and gaining even more attention. Mr C said he was pursuing the case to gain recognition rather than compensation. He and his supporters say the decision will allow hidden discrimination to persist.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Apple ordered to re-write 'inaccurate' Samsung statement,"Apple was forced on 18 October to publish a message making it clear that Samsung had not infringed the iPad's registered design. However Samsung complained the statement Apple had posted did not comply with the court order. Judges agreed and have told Apple it must be removed within 24 hours. A new, compliant version must then be posted. Michael Beloff QC, representing Apple, told judges that the company had thought that it had complied with the court order. ""It's not designed to punish,"" he said. ""It's not designed to make us grovel. The only purpose must be to dispel commercial uncertainty."" He asked that the company be given 14 days to post the replacement - but the request was firmly denied. Lord Justice Longmore told Mr Beloff: ""We are just amazed that you cannot put the right notice up at the same time as you take the other one down."" One of the other judges, Sir Robin Jacob, added: ""I would like to see the head of Apple [Tim Cook] make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the Apple company."" Apple told the BBC it did not want to comment further. 'Horse's mouth' Samsung complained that the notice posted by Apple was ""inaccurate and misleading"" because it added comments about other rulings in Germany and the US that had gone in the iPad-maker's favour. ""This has received enormous publicity and has perpetuated confusion as to Samsung's entitlement to market the Galaxy tablet computers in issue,"" a Samsung lawyer said in a written statement to judges. ""It has created the impression that the UK court is out of step with other courts."" The UK's ruling applies to the whole of the EU. The court order is the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga involving the two companies. Apple brought the case to the UK courts, alleging that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10 had infringed the design of its iPad. But in July, Judge Colin Birss disagreed on the grounds that Samsung's product was not as ""cool"". His ruling meant that Apple was denied the opportunity to impose a sales ban on Samsung's products. Apple was unsuccessful in appealing the ruling, and was ordered to place a notice on its website, newspapers and magazines explaining that Samsung had not infringed its designs. The intention, judges said, was not to make Apple ""grovel"", but to remove ""commercial uncertainty"" surrounding Samsung's products. ""A consumer might well think: 'I had better not buy a Samsung - maybe it's illegal and if I buy one it may not be supported',"" Sir Robin said. ""Apple itself must (having created the confusion) make the position clear: that it acknowledges that the court has decided that that these Samsung products do not infringe its registered design. ""The acknowledgement must come from the horse's mouth.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Aberdeen sanitary product pilot to start across Scotland,"The Scottish government scheme - designed to tackle ""period poverty"" - was launched in July last year. The six-month pilot was continued in March, and has distributed free products to more than 1,000 women. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance has announced the project will be extended across Scotland. Campaign inspired by the big screen The campaign to provide free feminine hygiene products was, in part, inspired by the 2016 film I, Daniel Blake. The film, a 2016 film directed by Ken Loach - includes a scene where an impoverished female character shoplifts a packet of tampons. Scots scriptwriter Paul Laverty wrote the scene after meeting women who struggled to afford essential hygiene products. The pilot scheme was led by the Community Food Initiatives North East (CFINE) social enterprise, and was welcomed by anti-poverty campaigners, including The Trussell Trust. It follows a growing campaign demanding ""dignity"" for women whose budgets do not stretch to sanitary protection. Ms Constance visited CFINE to hear about the work, and announced that, following the successful pilot in Aberdeen, the charity FareShare will distribute sanitary products from sites around the country, reaching an estimated 18,800 people. Ms Constance said: ""It is unacceptable that anyone in Scotland should be unable to access sanitary products and I am pleased that we are able to work with FareShare to make products available more widely through the services delivered by their partners."" Gillian Kynoch, head of FareShare in Scotland, said: ""We are excited to be working with the Scottish government to use our network to make sanitary products available to people across Scotland."" Labour MSP Monica Lennon welcomed the extension of the scheme, but called for a statutory requirement to ensure free provision in schools, colleges and universities as well as ""placing a duty on the Scottish government to deliver a free universal system of access"". She said: ""Scotland can be a world leader in tackling period poverty if we are bold enough to take these radical steps."" Is this really a problem in Scotland? In 2016, the Trussell Trust charity said of the 133,000 people who used Scotland's food banks in the previous financial year, ""thousands"" received feminine hygiene products. The charity's Scotland network manager, Ewan Gurr, said Scots were relying on food banks for essential toiletries after finding themselves in ""difficult financial circumstances"" - often due to benefit sanctions, delayed wages or low incomes. The charity worker said some women had even resorted to using toilet roll, socks or newspaper because they were unable to afford female sanitary products.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Models from Gerry Anderson's The Investigator up for sale,"The speedboat and sports car were produced for the 1973 show The Investigator, which never made it beyond a pilot episode. The models, both fitted with Honda 50cc engines, are expected to fetch up to Â£8,000 each at auction on 10 October. Mr Anderson's son, Jamie, said The Investigator had been ""doomed to fail from the start"". The show, which charted the adventures of two teenagers shrunk to a third of their size, was abandoned as the concept was considered ""too far-fetched"" and the radio controlled models were prone to radio interference. It was seen as a rare failure for Anderson, who also created shows such as Stingray and Terrahawks which used ""supermarionation"" - a sophisticated form of puppetry. He died in 2012, aged 83. Jamie Anderson, the managing director of Anderson Entertainment, said after 18 successful series, to have one misfire was ""not too bad"". ""In many ways it was doomed to fail from the start,"" he said. ""It was a combination of puppetry and live action, but it lacked the science fiction context that made previous shows so successful.""

New environmental watchdog to get legal teeth after Brexit,"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Ministers say the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) will be an independent statutory body to safeguard environmental standards. It will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit. Green groups question its independence and doubt the structure will replicate the EUâs environmental protections. Why is a new law needed? About 80% of the UKâs environmental laws have been forged in partnership with other nations in Europe. Some Brexiteers see leaving the EU as an opportunity to dilute environmental standards to increase competitiveness, but the government has promised this will not happen. At the moment, if the UK breaks green laws â like over air pollution for instance - it gets taken to court by the EU. Under the provisions of the draft Environment Bill, the new watchdog will have a similar legal power. It is a crucial decision after a long internal battle within government. The bill also sets down in the UK some of the key principles of European law â like the polluter pays principle, which establishes who is responsible if the environment is harmed. The bill will get debated after Easter, after the scheduled Brexit date of 29 March. The government says European law will remain in place in the UK until the new environment bill is passed, and any law-breaking will be dealt with by the OEP when it opens for business. âOur ambition is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than that in which we found it,"" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said. ""We will keep building on our successes by enhancing our environmental standards and delivering a Green Brexit.â There has been confusion over whether or not climate change will be included in the bill. Environmentalists insist that it must be, and on Wednesday a government source said it would be included in the bill in the new year. Later a spokesman said it would not be included. More recently, a Department for the Environment spokesman said climate might or might not be in the bill, depending on the results of consultations in coming months. How has it been received? Friends of the Earth said the proposals had several loopholes. The campaign group believes the environment department is nowhere near ready for a no-deal Brexit and fears there are not enough staff to enforce green laws. Ben Halfpenny, from Greener UK, told BBC News: ""There is a good level of ambition and broad scope. ""But there are big questions over power and enforcement. If the secretary of state appoints the board and decides the budget we are really worried about that.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook: Norwich painting-a-day artist 'overwhelmed' by praise,"Nick Chinnery has painted a watercolour of a Norwich landmark and posted it on Facebook every day since the new year. He said he had received hundreds of emails thanking him. ""If you can put a smile on people's faces through your own city I'd say it's something to be proud of,"" he said. The 49-year-old began painting in 2017 after spending less than Â£4 on brushes and paints during a rainy holiday in Cromer. After a difficult 2020, he set up his easel again during the current lockdown and searched online for ""Norwich historic buildings"" for inspiration. He lives nearby in Dereham but is currently shielding due to low immunity. ""I've painted some of the most iconic buildings that you can think of,"" said Mr Chinnery, who has completed more than 60 works to date. ""I put my heart and soul into everything, it lifts me and I get that sense of achievement."" Not only was his hobby lifting his own spirits, but he soon found his creativity was a tonic for others, too. He decided to start posting the pictures on the community Facebook page Secret Norwich, which has more than 43,000 members. ""I've had so many comments from people thanking me - they've said 'we are shielding, you are bringing Norwich to life', what a lovely city it is,"" he said. ""It must be in the hundreds of emails thanking me for the pictures, and I've heard from people in the US and Chile. ""It's all been very positive, it's overwhelming really. ""It's like putting an arm around me, a pat on the back, and it's nice to feel appreciated."" Interest has been so keen that Mr Chinnery hopes to organise a post-lockdown exhibition, by which time he will have 80 to 90 pieces. And when he can return to the streets of Norwich, will he look at it differently? ""One hundred percent - I've certainly taken it for granted,"" he said. ""As soon as lockdown is finished, I want to visit the places I have painted and possibly paint them again, in situ."" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Covid-19: Record day for UK vaccinations as total nears 9m,"As of Saturday a total of 8,977,329 people had received a jab, and 491,053 of those have had a second dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding each vaccine ""brings us one step closer to normal"". However, a further 587 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported on Sunday. It takes the UK's total by that measure to 106,158, although the number of reported deaths tends to be lower over the weekend. In a video posted on Twitter Mr Hancock said he was ""so grateful to everybody who's involved in making this happen"", and said it meant three-quarters of those aged 75 to 79 and four-fifths of those over 80 had now been vaccinated. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), described the volume of vaccinations as a ""staggering achievement"". Earlier, the health secretary predicted ""a happy and free Great British summer"" but warned of a ""a tough few months"" as national restrictions continue across the UK while vaccinations are administered. His comments came after Dr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England's Covid strategy chief, warned that ending the current coronavirus lockdown must happen ""very slowly, very cautiously"". ""It is better to be cautious, let's get the population vaccinated,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. England's current lockdown will continue until 8 March, when it is hoped schools could begin to reopen, while national restrictions are also in place across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The vaccines record comes after a week which had seen a row with the European Union over vaccine distribution. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said there were ""a lot of lessons to be learnt"" after Brussels reversed its threat to put checks on the Irish border - a move which had been widely condemned. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen had assured Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU"". Meanwhile, the situation in hospitals has ""stabilised"", according to intensive care doctor Prof Rupert Pearse, who said it was going to be ""another very hard year"" for NHS staff.

Macron aide Alexandre Benalla to be dismissed after protesters beaten,"The action against Alexandre Benalla was taken after ""new facts"" emerged in the case, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Friday. Mr Benalla is being questioned over the footage of the May Day protests. There were calls for him to be sacked after he was identified in a newspaper. Police are questioning Mr Benalla, an assistant to Mr Macron's chief of staff, over footage filmed by a student activist showing a woman and a man being beaten during the demonstrations on 1 May. French newspaper Le Monde identified the attacker as Mr Benalla. While he faces questions over the assault, prosecutors said on Friday that he is also facing charges of impersonating a police officer. In May, a few days after the incident, Mr Benalla was given a two-week suspension, but nothing was reported to prosecutors. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that this suggests that Mr Macron's office may have already been aware of his actions. A source close to the inquiry said that three police officers had also been suspended on suspicion of providing Mr Benalla with surveillance footage of the demonstration in an attempt to prove his innocence, Le Monde reports. What happened? The incident took place in a popular tourist spot at Place de la Contrescarpe in the fifth district of Paris, where about 100 people had gathered on 1 May. The original video, posted on social media by 21-year-old Taha Bouhafs, shows a man in a police helmet who is not in uniform joining CRS riot police after clashes erupted. He grabs a woman by the neck, charging her down the street, before both disappear off camera. Shortly afterwards he returns to the scene, attacking another protester who had been carried a short distance by police before being left alone on the ground. The man in the helmet can be seen grabbing the young protester around the neck, hitting him in the head and apparently stamping on his stomach when he falls to the ground. Who is Alexandre Benalla? Mr Benalla's main duty was to arrange security for the president's engagements. Before he joined the presidential staff he had the role of head of security during Mr Macron's election campaign in 2017. In that role, he was a constant companion to the future president, and archive photographs show the two men together at many high-profile public events. Formerly an employee of a private security firm, Mr Benalla had worked with other French politicians in the past - including leading Socialist Martine Aubry and Mr Macron's predecessor in the ElysÃ©e, FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2012, he was hired as a driver for Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Mr Montebourg told Le Monde that Mr Benalla was fired for misconduct after causing a car accident in the minister's presence and wanting to flee the scene.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

""It would be appropriate for us to have [Mr Crompton] to deal with some of the points that have been raised. ""I had asked David Crompton to come in and talk about the aftermath of Hillsborough and what his force is doing about it. ""Therefore it is appropriate following these revelations that he should also tell us what South Yorkshire police is doing and what appears to be a decision by agencies not to work together to try and uncover this criminality."" The investigation by The Times - with access to confidential documents from the police intelligence bureau, social services and other organisations - alleged widespread abuse. Force denial The newspaper said a confidential 2010 report by the Police Intelligence Bureau detailed ""a significant problem with networks of Asian males exploiting young white females, particularly in Rotherham and Sheffield"". The paper claimed that in another confidential report in 2010 from Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board ""there are sensitivities of ethnicity with potential to endanger the harmony of community relationships"". South Yorkshire Police has emphatically denied withholding information about the scale of sexual exploitation of girls by gangs of men. In an earlier statement the force said: ""South Yorkshire Police is recognised as leading the way on what is now being recognised nationally as a problem and to suggest that the force and its partners are deliberately withholding information on the issue is a gross distortion and unfair on the teams of dedicated specialists working to tackle the problem."" It said the force was ""working with local authorities, social services and NHS on several live investigations, two of which are large and likely to lead to more prosecutions; we will act when we have the evidence"". The statement added that The Times was ""wrong to suggest a lack of commitment is shown towards the problem as our record shows"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Labour's Brexit plan takes shape,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Gordon Brown loved them. George Osborne relished them. In an era that had been dominated by centre ground politics where everyone fought over the middle, those lines were important to answer voters' claims that ""they're all the same"". Today, Labour is spelling out ""dividing lines"" for a different reason. For months the party has agonised over its position on Brexit. Wrangling with four seemingly incompatible truths - millions of their voters in traditional Labour areas wanted Brexit; the vast majority of the party's MPs wanted to stay, in line with its official position; the leader was Remain but not exactly in love with the idea, but an important constituency of Labour voters at the New Labour end of things were ardent Remainers. Got it? In the end, Labour concluded it had to back the government's triggering of Article 50 with a few notable exceptions. And now it has officially backed Brexit. How, on this issue, can they show they are different to the Tories? Enter Sir Keir Starmer's speech this morning, interestingly, well ahead of the party's manifesto. He'll promise Labour would guarantee rights for EU nationals who live in the UK, sources say a '9am, day one' action for a Labour government. He'll say Labour would scrap the Tories' Brexit plan and in its place put forward legislation that would more fulsomely and explicitly protect all rights currently enshrined in European legislation. He'll say the idea of walking away with no deal must not be an option, and give Parliament a say on the final deal as well as regular formal updates. It is very different to the Tory plan and there has been a very active campaign to protect EU citizens who live in the UK. And a second referendum will not be in the party's manifesto. Labour will hope not to get bogged down in arguments over that. Privately senior figures say it's not possible to see how you get to a second vote, logistically or politically. But on the fairly understandable basis that in 2017 politics it is foolish to rule absolutely anything out, they can't or won't say explicitly say that under no circumstances could there ever be a second vote, or under no circumstances could we ever stay in. A senior source told me they would never argue to stay in the EU as it is, but IF there were significant reforms that situation could hypothetically change. It is a massive IF, even worth putting in capital letters in bold! For some of their voters, particularly in London, that's the kind of approach they crave. But claims from their critics that Labour could potentially seek to stay in the EU is a dividing line the party hardly needs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brit Awards 2018: Stars to wear white rose pins on red carpet,"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The show's organisers wrote to the head of every UK record label on Wednesday to inform them of the plan. The letter says performers, presenters and guests will be given a pin ""as a symbol of solidarity, which we invite them to wear, if they so choose"". Dua Lipa, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Paloma Faith are among the artists expected to lend their support. The Time's Up movement works to combat sexual assault and harassment in the entertainment industry. Performers first adopted the white rose as a symbol of solidarity with victims of abuse at this month's Grammy Awards. The demonstration was organised by record company executives Meg Harkins and Karen Rait, after they realised the US ceremony had no plans to show support for the movement. They assembled a group of 12 other women in music, calling themselves Voices in Entertainment, and chose the white rose because of its association with the suffragette movement. On the night of the Grammys, stars including Camila Cabello, Pink, Lana Del Rey, Elton John, Lady Gaga, Cardi B and Miley Cyrus all added the rose to their outfits. ""It's incredible how the world is pivoting in a new direction,"" said British star Rita Ora on the red carpet. ""The more voices that come together, the more powerful everything gets."" While the Grammys demonstration was arranged on the fly, the Brits have proactively endorsed Time's Up, and will be supplying accessories for everyone attending the show next Wednesday, 21 February. Maggie Crowe, director of events at the Brits Trust, said the decision to adopt the rose was ""because of its historical importance; representing hope, peace, sympathy and resistance"". Meg Harkins of Voices In Entertainment said: ""We are thrilled The Brits have taken the proactive decision to support Voices In Entertainment and Time's Up. ""This is not only an important conversation in the US but all over the world and The Brits will help focus attention on these ongoing issues."" The move comes two years after the Brits faced criticism for a lack of diversity amongst its nominees and winners. After the #BritsSoWhite hashtag became a trending topic, organisers announced a major overhaul of their procedures, increasing the proportion of voters from BAME backgrounds, and boosting the number of female voters. This year's ceremony sees the likes of Stormzy, J Hus and Loyle Carner up for major awards; while pop star Dua Lipa has received five nominations - more than any other female artist in the ceremony's history.

Zoom sees more growth after 'unprecedented' 2020,"The video conferencing company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (Â£2.66bn). The forecast pushed shares in the company up more than 6% in after-hours trade in New York. Investors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as more people get vaccinated and social distancing restrictions lift. Zoom said it did not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong. The firm's sales in the last three months of 2020 were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m. ""The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to an unprecedented year for Zoom,"" company boss Eric Yuan said. ""As the world emerges from the pandemic, our work has only begun."" 'The future is here' The pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight. The firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, saw sales soar 326% to $2.6bn in 2020. Profits jumped from just $21.7m in 2019 to $671.5m. While some companies have started to ease staff back into the office, many others have said they expect that some of the increased flexibility introduced during the pandemic will linger. ""The future is here with the rise of remote and work from anywhere trends,"" Mr Yuan said in prepared remarks for investors. ""We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner."" Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Zoom's fate would depend on how it manages to compete against firms such as Microsoft and Google, which have introduced similar features. ""Although it stole an early march on other players in the first few months of the crisis, it does now have much stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft and Google who have significantly upped their game,"" she wrote in a research note. ""It may be that we have become so used to pandemic habits that we will stick with our virtual social lives, particularly for long distance friendships and work relationships. But just how large a slice of the live video pie Zoom manages to hang on to will depend on how it matches up to its powerful rivals.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: MPs debate pet theft law change amid lockdown rise,"They were debating two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt also said pets have been taken at a time when people ""need their companionship the most"". The government said it was ""keen to act"". Opening the debate on Monday, Conservative MP Mr Hunt told Westminster Hall: ""Covid-19 has made pet theft reform more pressing, not less."" He added: ""Our pets are being snatched away from us in record numbers just when we need their companionship the most. ""Organised crime groups are planning and ruthlessly executing the thefts of our cherished pets. ""They know the money they can make from breeding pedigrees and selling puppies for a quick profit, yet we're fighting this growing tide with outdated and underpowered laws. ""The risk of small fines will not stop this type of organised crime."" He added by making pet theft a specific offence, it will empower judges to be able to hand out two-year prison sentences. The debate follows the BBC's own investigation which suggested 2020 has been the ""worst ever"" for dog thefts. During lockdown demand grew for puppies and so did the price, attracting the attention of criminals, it is believed. A BBC freedom of information request showed five policing areas saw a double-digit increase in the number of dog thefts reported between January and July 2020, compared with the previous year. Dr Daniel Allen, an animal expert from Keele University, who started both petitions which led to the debate, said criminals were targeting breeders and ""taking the mum and the pups in one fell swoop"". He added: ""During lockdown, people wanted that canine companionship but there is an increasing risk of our pets being taken away from us."" Victoria Prentis, minister for agriculture, fisheries and food, said the government was ""keen to act"" on the issue. However, she told Westminster Hall that it did not think the creation of a specific offence for pet theft, with a two-year custodial penalty, ""would really help much"". ""We do think the way to go is to continue the discussions on sentencing guidelines,"" she said. ""The government is very willing to work with police and animal welfare organisations to bring this forward and we are keen to act in this area.""

Alcohol age rise plan rejected,"The SNP administration wanted to let local licensing boards ban off-licence sales to under-21s but the move was blocked by Holyrood's health committee. It is the latest blow to the Scottish government's Alcohol Bill. Last week, Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MSPs voted to remove a measure setting a minimum price for alcohol. Opposition MSPs have now said the move to raise the purchase age would discriminate against young people. Labour committee member Dr Richard Simpson said: ""It's unfair if young people are only able to consume alcohol in a pub or restaurant but cannot buy a bottle of wine to have at home while watching the television. ""We're all aware of binge drinking being a problem for some young people but this can't be tackled by discriminating against all young people, even in a specific area."" Dr Simpson also raised concerns that teenagers would travel to neighbouring areas without restrictions, moving the problem somewhere else. Existing laws should be better used to tackle the issue, he said. Tory MSP Mary Scanlon and Ross Finnie of the Lib Dems pointed to concerns from the Grocers' Federation that 18-year-olds could still sell alcohol and obtain licences to do so. Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said it was important not to focus solely on young people when tackling alcohol issues. But she told the committee that 2,000 people under the age of 20 were discharged from hospitals in 2007-08 with an alcohol-related diagnosis. Other measures in the Alcohol Bill include a ban on drink promotions, a retailers' social responsibility fee and tighter proof of age rules. But Ms Sturgeon said it was important to see the Alcohol Bill as a series of measures to tackle drink-related problems. She said: ""We should not see any particular initiative as a magic bullet - we need a strong package of measures. This initiative is simply another tool in the box."" The opposition move was backed by Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students in Scotland. He said: ""It seems totally wrong that someone could vote, pay taxes and bring up a family but not buy alcohol for their own home."" The SNP has the option of trying to re-insert the measure it when parliament debates the Alcohol Bill at its third and final stage. The government has already said it will take a similar course of action with its plan to set a minimum price per unit of alcohol at 45p.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
RBS stands by branch closure decision,"MPs on a Westminster committee said the response to the bank's plans to shut 62 of its branches in Scotland was ""overwhelmingly negative"". And they said customers in rural areas felt particularly let down. But RBS officials insisted the bank was responding to changes in customer behaviour, including increased use of online banking. They were appearing before MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee in the wake of RBS announcing in December that it is to close 62 branches in Scotland, with the loss of 158 jobs. Some of the closures will see towns and villages left without any bank branches - with concerns being raised about the impact on elderly, vulnerable and small business customers, particularly in rural locations. Committee chairman Pete Wishart told the meeting that he had not experienced such an overwhelming negative response to a single issue in his 17 years as an SNP MP. He told the RBS representatives: ""I think what's also disappointing is your defiant response to this, where you are singularly saying you are refusing to reconsider any of these closures which is going down particularly badly in a number of rural areas."" However Jane Howard, managing director of personal banking, and Les Matheson, chief executive of personal and business banking, told the committee that the closures would save the bank Â£9.5m annually. But they insisted the decision had not been taken to save money. Greater variety Mr Matheson said said fewer than 1% of RBS customers go into a branch on a weekly basis, with a 42% reduction in branch transactions in Scotland since 2014. And he said RBS was offering people a greater variety of ways to bank, through post offices, mobile vans and new community bankers, as well as online and in remaining branches. Mr Matheson added: ""We understand that customers are concerned about the change, that customers find change difficult, and we are committed to helping them through that process, and we have lots of ways of doing that. ""We are both personally committed, as are all of our colleagues, to helping every individual customer."" Labour's Danielle Rowley and Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine pointed out that the bank had received a Â£45bn taxpayer bailout during the financial crash. Mr Matheson said: ""We understand the support that the bank has had and clearly we appreciate that, but again, we have to take account of changes that are happening.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus testing urged over pub outbreak in Stone,"Health officials said anyone who was at the Crown and Anchor in Stone, Staffordshire, between 16-18 July should get tested. One person who tested positive after being at the pub also held a private gathering, causing a further spread, Staffordshire County Council said. In a post shared on Facebook, the pub said it would close. Dr Richard Harling, director of public health at the council, said: ""This appears to largely be a young adult demographic, young adults in the 18-21 age bracket."" Dr Harling said there was a tracking system in place at the Crown and Anchor, ""but it didn't capture the number of patrons very comprehensively"". The council has encouraged anyone who may have been in close contact with someone at the pub that weekend and people who may have been drinking in Stone then and are currently experiencing symptoms to get tested. Ayrron Robinson, who filmed the pub, said he was ""angry"" and ""frustrated"" at seeing the crowds. ""We're talking a hundred, two hundred people in there,"" he claimed. ""You can hear them. I've got double glazed windows, [but] you can hear them."" A walk-in test centre was open at Crown Street car park in Stone and more than 300 people were tested in the first two hours, with queues forming. For the next four days a mobile testing unit will operate by appointment only instead. It will be open from 11:00 to 15:00 BST on Thursday and Friday and from 10:30 to 15:30 on Saturday and Sunday. People who are not experiencing symptoms will need to choose the ""I am in a lockdown area with a coronavirus outbreak"" option, even though there is no lockdown in Stone. After images of the pub were posted online, local MP Sir Bill Cash said: ""It shows a degree of lack of concern for other people and it just is completely unacceptable and inappropriate for people to gather in such circumstances."" Stafford Borough Council said it would cancel the Stone Farmers' Market which was due to take place this weekend. Another pub in the town, The Swan, said in a statement on Facebook it would stay closed in light of Covid-19 cases in the area. Owner of Stonebaked Cafe Deb Wilkinson said: ""Something like this sets people back. ""People will be scared to come out again really, especially in a little town like this."" Councillor Ian Parry said: ""What we've seen is partly some selfish behaviour that's going on and we need to remind ourselves that we are responsible to each other during this crisis."" He said the town was busy on Wednesday and claimed ""it's very safe to come to Stone"". The BBC has approached the Crown and Anchor for comment.

Polish bishops for total ban on Sunday shopping,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring ""Free Sundays are what all Catholics, non-Catholics and non-believers need,"" Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki told Polish Radio ahead of a meeting of the Bishops Conference on Friday, which is expected to support the ban. The idea was put forward last year by the powerful Solidarity trade union, backed by a million-strong petition, and has been batted back and forth in a parliamentary subcommittee ever since. The clerics are careful to base their argument on quality of life rather than religious grounds. ""Families don't just need financial support, they need time for themselves,"" said the Archbishop of Katowice, Wiktor Skworc. He appealed to the government to ""show some compassion for women in the form of those who have to work in supermarkets on Sundays"", and accused it of showing ""contempt"" for Solidarity and the bishops by delaying consideration of the ban. He also warned local MPs and senators that he expected them to vote ""in line with the views of their voters,"" the Wirtualna Polska website reports. ""Tourism to take a hit"" But there is strong opposition to the proposal in many circles. The latest poll for the TVN 24 news channel in March showed a clear 59% in favour of keeping shops open and only 35% for the ban, which would incidentally allow Sunday trading seven days a year. Piotr Mazurkiewicz, who writes on the economy for the heavyweight Rzeczpospolita daily, says ""no one should be under any illusion"" that lucrative shopping tourism from Germany and Scandinavia would be hard hit, as most foreign shoppers head to Poland at the weekend. The government and retail groups have suggested compromises like shutting shop every other Sunday, or only after lunch, and the rival OPZZ union confederation proposes higher wages for Sunday working, but Solidarity chief Piotr Duda is holding out for ""Four free Sundays a month, full stop, end of story"", Dziennik daily reports. He has received a boost by efforts to speed up parliamentary discussions by the subcommittee overseeing the proposal, which happens to be led by former Solidarity chairman Janusz Sniadek. Mr Sniadek is confident the bill will be ready for a first reading by January, according to the Money.pl financial website. Labour Minister Elzbieta Rafalska acknowledged in June that the bill has gained momentum, and could be passed next year, TVN 24 reports. But she advises that any shopping restrictions must be introduced ""in stages"" after careful consideration by parliament.

Sex robots may cause psychological damage,"By Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, Seattle They say the technology is escaping oversight because agencies are too embarrassed to investigate it. The scientists want action to prevent the unregulated use of such robots. Dr Christine Hendren of Duke University told BBC News that ""the stakes were high"". ""Some robots are programmed to protest, to create a rape scenario,"" she said. ""Some are designed to look like children. One developer of these in Japan is a self-confessed paedophile, who says that this device is a prophylactic against him ever hurting a real child. ""But does that normalise and give people a chance to practise these behaviours that should be treated by just stamping them out?"" Dr Hendren was speaking here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A number of sex robots are advertised online. A US-based firm, Realrobitix, has posted a video marketing its Harmony robot for between $8,000 and $10,000. It is a life-sized doll which can blink and move its eyes and neck, and also its lips as it talks. Speaking with a Scottish accent, the mannequin says, ""if you play your cards right you will have some pleasure and fun coming your way"". And the firm's founder and CEO, Matt McMullen explains that Harmony has AI that enables ""her"" to develop a relationship with the owner. ""She is going to remember things about you, your likes, your dislikes and your experiences,"" says Mr McMullen. Kathleen Richardson, who is a professor of the Ethics and Culture of Robots and AI at De Montfort University in Leicester, wants this kind of marketing outlawed. ""These companies are saying, 'you don't have a friendship? You don't have a life partner? Don't worry we can create a robot girlfriend for you'. ""A relationship with a girlfriend is based on intimacy, attachment and reciprocity. These are things that can't be replicated by machines,"" she said. Prof Richardson advises a pressure group that has been set up to monitor the emergence of these products. The campaign against sex robots is working with policy experts to draw up legislation aimed at banning claims that companion robots can be a substitute for human relationships. ""Are we going to move into a future where we keep normalising the idea of women as sex objects?"" she told BBC News. ""If someone has a problem with a relationship in their actual lives you deal with that with other people, not by normalising the idea that you can have a robot in your life and it can be as good as a person.""

Coronavirus: UK's already huge changes may just be the start,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Whitehall had been monitoring and fearing the arrival of the coronavirus on these shores for many weeks. But when Boris Johnson told us not so long ago that we would face a significant challenge from coronavirus, who could have imagined how the mounting cases of the disease in the UK would touch nearly every aspect of our lives? Now, after a frenetic few days in Westminster, the government machine is working at breakneck speed to manage the health service, and drastically improve its capacity; it has made a huge decision to close schools that will affect millions of families' daily lives and the education of a generation of children; it has provided what could be a temporary bridge, or evolve into a permanent bailout of huge chunks of the economy; negotiated new arrangements, or is in the middle of doing so with the insurance industry, the supermarkets, the travel and aviation industries, and tonight the Treasury is frantically trying to design a new method of providing welfare to those who need it and financial support to businesses struggling to keep afloat and keep paying wages. And that really may only be the start. The idea of a protracted policy process of vague green papers, setting out policy, then white papers, setting out drafts of new laws, then Parliament chewing over legislation for months seems like something from another world now. The government is not, as things stand, about to shift to a much more draconian approach that other countries have pursued. It is ministers' hope to manage the situation in the expectation that it may be around for many many months. And despite the prime minister's attempt to offer a more hopeful promise to the country that we could ""turn the tide"" in 12 weeks, it's not the expectation in Downing Street that this threat will soon disappear. He talked hopefully about the possibility of a significant increase in testing, and the possibility of science moving fast enough to find solutions. But making the virus manageable for now, and the future, is the goal, to give the health service time to adapt to confront it, rather than any expectation of making the coronavirus quickly disappear altogether. There is the prospect too of a short, sharp shock to the economy but the real possibility of a prolonged and very real recession. Inside government the evidence is already there of people losing their jobs. This is an economic fight perhaps as much as a medical one, with resilience and moral actors too. Remember for the vast majority of people who contract the virus it is a mild illness. But it is dangerous for vulnerable groups, and its wider impact on our way of life is already profound. The government's mantra has been to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. But no-one can know yet what that might really be.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Yushchenko testifies against old Orange ally Tymoshenko,"Mrs Tymoshenko is being tried in Kiev on charges of exceeding her authority while prime minister, in signing a gas contract with Russia two years ago. If found guilty she could face up to 10 years in prison. Mr Yushchenko's arrival in court triggered angry scenes among scores of Tymoshenko supporters outside. Cold stare He told the court that the 2009 gas agreement had been a ""political"" deal which continued to inflict economic damage on Ukraine. With Mrs Tymoshenko staring at him across the courtroom, he said the basis for the deal - signed after talks between Mrs Tymoshenko and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin - had been ""a political scenario"" rather than an economic calculation. ""Russia needed an obliging leader,"" he added. Mr Yushchenko's evidence appeared to support the prosecution's case that Mrs Tymoshenko had rail-roaded Ukraine's state gas company into signing a deal which saddled the country with an excessively high price for Russian gas, Reuters news agency says. Mrs Tymoshenko said she disagreed with Mr Yushchenko's testimony but declined to argue with him in court. ""I don't want for the Orange Revolution to go on trial in this court,"" she said. One of her supporters then shouted at Mr Yushchenko using an expletive and was expelled from the courtroom, the Associated Press reports. When he emerged back into the street, Tymoshenko supporters chanted ""shame"" and pelted his black Mercedes with eggs as he departed. Faint echo of 2004 Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko were once allies, the BBC's David Stern reports from Kiev. They came to power in the 2004 Orange Revolution, a mass protest which overturned fraudulent presidential elections. But Mr Yushchenko and Mrs Tymoshenko quickly became bitter rivals, and Ukraine's government was paralysed with their infighting, our correspondent says. In 2010, Mrs Tymoshenko was defeated in the presidential elections to Viktor Yanukovych, who was the loser six years earlier. Some observers fear that the court case against her is an attempt by the Yanukovych government to remove her now as a political opponent.

Greater Anglia apologises over London to Norwich train disruption,"Services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich were disrupted in both directions after a train stopped, blocking the line near Chelmsford on Tuesday evening. Some passengers reported delays of up to five hours. Abellio Greater Anglia apologised for the ""delays and cancellations"". These were caused by ""an overhead power line problem between Chelmsford and Hatfield Peverel which resulted in a train failing, blocking one of the two lines"", managing director Jamie Burles said. Passenger Andy Newman, from Norwich, tweeted: ""No movement, no air-con, no information, no staff. Time to make it no franchise.""

She said there was a ""generic apology"" on the public address system but ""no specific information"", and that police were called to Liverpool Street. ""Eventually when passengers got really irate and the police were called, a manager appeared and he was trying to shout across the concourse, so you can imagine how successful that was. ""Eventually the police went off and found him a megaphone, poor lad. ""I think what frustrated people is he was saying the train breakdown was 'catastrophic'. If the train had been moved it would have brought down all the overhead lines,"" Ms Pilmer said. ""If that was the case at four o'clock, why at nine o'clock were we all standing there?

Dutch state liable for three Srebrenica deaths - court,"The men had been ordered to leave a UN compound run by Dutch peacekeeping forces when Bosnian Serb forces overran it. The ruling upheld an earlier decision by an appeals court in 2011. Considered Europe's worst massacre since WWII, 7,500 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed in the atrocity. The case centred on three Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) who were working for the Dutch force, Dutchbat, during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. They were electrician Rizo Mustafic and the father and brother of former UN interpreter Hasan Nuhanovic. The three men were among thousands who took shelter in the UN compound as Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Gen Ratko Mladic overran Srebrenica on 11 July 1995. Two days later, Dutch peacekeepers forced the Bosniaks out of the compound. Mr Nuhanovic and the relatives of Mr Mustafic, who launched the case in 2003, had argued that the three men should have been protected by the peacekeepers. The Dutch government had argued that the soldiers were under United Nations' control. 'Very relieved' In 2011, the court ruled that the Dutch troops should not have handed the three men over to Bosnian Serb forces. ""The (appeals) court decision is upheld,"" Judge Floris Bakels said as relatives of the victims broke down in tears and hugged each other. He said it would be ""unacceptable"" for countries not to be able to hold their peacekeepers to account. ""It's great, it's really great,"" said Mr Nuhanovic, who also lost his mother in Srebrenica, but he said it is only one of ""many battles"" being fought in Bosnia as ""hundreds of war criminals still roam the streets"". Mr Mustafic's daughter Alma, who was 14 at the time of his death, said she was ""very relieved"". ""It's always very difficult to grieve, but I hope this decision will help us,"" she said. The final ruling means that relatives of the victims can now claim compensation from the Dutch state. Correspondents say the ruling may have an impact on future UN peacekeeping missions, as states could be reluctant to participate in foreign military operations amid fears of being held responsible for situations that get out of control. The United Nations has said it is too early to say whether there will be any implications for international peacekeeping in future.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"North needs Â£50bn to close gap with south, report claims","IPPR North said the government's Northern Powerhouse strategy could only be ""converted to reality"" with ""substantial investment"" and a ""step-change"" in its commitment to the north.

'One north, one economy' The Treasury claimed the strategy was ""not about how much money is spent but about giving local leaders more power.""

But it said three changes were required in order for its potential to be realised: Commitments to transport spending and devolution were the ""key ingredients"" for turning ""northern powerhouse rhetoric"" into reality, the report claimed. It said a ""rebalanced economy"" could only be achieved through tackling ""lagging"" productivity, under-investment in transport, poor connectivity between cities and low qualifications and skills levels. 'Only the beginning' The study identified several ""key drivers"" of growth, including infrastructure and connectivity, innovation, business support, leadership and policy development. It argued: ""There is an urgent need (for) more detail and more action to support the pan-northern vision, to ensure business, public and civil sectors are galvanised to act now to sustain the momentum behind devolution and take advantage of this unprecedented window of opportunity."" Ed Cox, director of IPPR North and co-author of the report, said: ""The historical economic under-performance of the north of England is not natural, nor is it inevitable. ""The opportunity is there to be seized for northern prosperity to create national prosperity."" A government spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has been determined to challenge the lazy, decades-old acceptance that decline in the north was inevitable. Mr Osborne had already invested Â£13bn in transport and agreed ""a ground-breaking devolution deal with Greater Manchester,"" he added. The spokesperson continued: ""We are already making significant progress. This is only the beginning. ""The IPPR rightly identifies the massive opportunities in the North but this is not just about how much money is spent - it is also about giving local leaders more power and for communities to be bold enough to come forward and take them.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"JJB Sports in administration with 2,200 job losses","The administrators said they had managed to save 550 jobs after selling part of the business to Sports Direct. JJB's High Street rival is buying the website and 20 of its stores, which will be rebranded Sports Direct. The remaining 133 JJB stores are to close immediately, the administrators KPMG said. The Wigan-based retailer was hurt by the economic downturn and struggled to compete with Sports Direct. 'Not been enough' Dave Whelan, the current owner of Wigan football club, founded JJB Sports in 1971, before selling it in 2007. He said the firm should have been able to deal with the competition. ""When I sold it - I sold it something like five years ago - just before that it was valued at a billion pounds. ""Now it's completely worthless and it's amazing how it's happened,"" he told the BBC. The administrators, KPMG, said they had kept on 167 employees to assist them and that all staff made redundant have had their arrears of wages and holiday entitlements paid in full. ""Successive attempts to restructure the business, both financially and operationally, have not been enough to prevent the company falling into administration,"" said Richard Fleming, the UK head of restructuring at KPMG. The administrators said they had spoken to more than 100 parties in the first few days of their appointment - including eight trade and private-equity firms tabling bids - but the level of cash on offer and other factors were not enough. ""Unfortunately a buyer could only be found for 20 stores on a going-concern basis."" 'That was it' In Scotland, more than 350 jobs are being lost with the closure of 26 stores. Only four units will remain open. Fraser Harrower worked as a sales adviser at the Dunfermline branch of JJB, which was closed down this morning. He told the BBC that two administrators walked in unannounced. ""At around 11:30 this morning we had two administrators walk in and they were there for all of maybe 90 seconds and my assistant manager came out and we were told to close the shutters and the business was closed. That was it."" Earlier this year, JJB announced a Â£30m investment to help turn around the business, including Â£20m from US retailer Dick's Sporting Goods and Â£10m from existing shareholders. However, just three months later, shares in JJB tumbled after Dick's Sporting Goods said it had in effect written off its entire investment. In August, it put itself up for sale after it failed to raise new funds to help revamp its stores.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Northern Ireland earnings on the rise,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor That means typical weekly pay rose from Â£500 to Â£521, or just more than Â£27,000 a year. Northern Ireland and the West Midlands experienced the largest increase in weekly earnings of the 12 UK regions. In the UK as a whole, weekly earnings were Â£569, an increase of 1.2% in real terms from 2017. Despite the improvements, real weekly earnings in Northern Ireland are still below 2009 levels when they reached Â£527. The increase in Northern Ireland weekly earnings over the year was driven by the private sector, while typical weekly pay in the public sector fell. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics & business editor It seems clear that sustained employment growth in Northern Ireland is feeding through into increased private sector wages. Shop floor factory workers seem to have done best of all, with pay growth of around 7% over the last year. Northern Ireland has also moved to the middle of the UK regional pay league above Wales, the North East, East Midlands and Yorkshire. But public sector pay restraint remains evident with the typical wage falling in real terms. That can only add to the low morale in many parts of our public services. Private sector pay was up by 2.3% in real terms, while in the public sector the real terms fall was 2.5%. However, the typical public sector employee still earns about a third more (Â£621) than the typical private sector employee (Â£465). Some of the difference between the public and private sector figures are due to differences in the composition of the respective workforces. Many of the lowest-paid occupations, such as hospitality and retail, exist almost exclusively in the private sector, while in the public sector there is a larger proportion of graduate-level and professional occupations. The details are contained in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. The UK-wide survey of employers is based on a 1% sample of employee jobs. It is drawn from HM Revenue and Customs' Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Northern Ireland remains the only region in the UK with a gender pay gap for full-time employees in favour of women. Women earned 3.5% more per hour than men in 2018, in contrast to the UK where women earned 8.6% less than men. The gap in favour of full-time female workers overall is partly to do with a higher proportion of public sector jobs in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK. There are more women employed in this sector than men and these jobs tend to be higher paid, in general, than in the private sector. At a wider, all-employee level, there is still a gap in favour of men because there are more full-time male employees.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Donald Trump reverses plans for flavoured e-cigarette ban,"He announced plans for a ban in September, but reportedly decided not to enact it this month because of possible job losses and voter pushback. Thousands of lung injuries have been attributed to vaping this year. Mr Trump last week said he would meet industry and medical professionals to find ""an acceptable solution"". ""Children's health & safety, together with jobs, will be a focus!"" he tweeted on 11 November. The concerns about jobs and voters were raised by advisers during a 4 November flight to a Kentucky campaign rally, the Washington Post newspaper reported on Sunday. It quoted Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale as saying that a ban of flavoured e-cigarettes could hurt the president in key states in the 2020 election. Mr Trump decided not to sign off on a ""decision memo"", fearing potential job losses and voter anger, the newspaper reported. The New York Times also reported that ""allies working for the vaping industry"" had warned him that such a move could cost him support. First Lady Melania Trump and the president's eldest daughter, Ivanka, had advocated the ban. E-cigarettes are battery-powered smoking devices filled with a liquid that contains nicotine, which is then heated into vapours that users inhale. As of November, over 2,000 Americans have been affected by lung injuries attributed to vaping, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). More than half of those affected are between 13 and 24-years-old. Forty-two deaths have been confirmed in 24 states and more are under investigation. A senior official told the Washington Post that Mr Trump ""didn't know much about the issue and was just doing it for Melania and Ivanka"". In September, Mr Trump told reporters his administration would implement strong rules to protect ""innocent children"", like his 13-year-old son Barron. ""We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected,"" he said, adding that First Lady Melania Trump, who made a rare appearance during the policy announcement, felt ""very, very strongly"" about the issue. ""People are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely."" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at the time a policy would be drafted within a few weeks. E-cigarette manufacturers such as Juul have been accused of fuelling childhood addiction through flavoured products such as mango, cream or cinnamon roll. Juul had stopped selling a number of flavours expecting a national ban, the New York Times reported. But there have also been protests against a potential ban, and the #IVapeIVote campaign argued that a ban would put shops across the country out of business. It could also force people to smoke cigarettes instead, vaping advocates say. New York, Michigan, Washington and Rhode Island have passed bans on flavoured vaping products, though they have all faced legal challenges. Other states and cities are considering similar legislation. Globally, over 40 million people use vapes or e-cigarettes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Glasgow Council gender pay dispute has been a long battle,"By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland local government correspondent Many similar claims have been settled across Scotland in recent years. But this one was proving more significant because of the number of claimants, the potential cost and the length of time the process was taking. Council leader Susan Aitken always stressed her support for the women involved. And yet she also faced a large strike in October - described by some as the biggest strike by women since the rent strikes of World War One - because unions believed the process had got bogged down. Much still needs to be done - the claimants need to approve the deal and the funding arrangements need to be finalised. The likely cost has not been made public but is expected to be in the region of Â£500-550m. 'Cherished assets' The council always dismissed speculation that raising this money would mean selling cherished assets, making massive cuts or begging the Scottish government for cash. Instead, the money is likely to be raised by schemes such as re-mortgaging sports centres and will not involve the disposal of significant assets. However, the terms of those financial arrangements could still add to costs and so lead to further pressure on the council's budget and the possibility of more savings, efficiency savings or tough choices. Another question is whether the settlement would have been achieved without the need for industrial action. Those who led the action spoke of their frustration at a process which seemed to be getting nowhere. But others questioned why they were striking against an SNP administration which said it wanted to solve a problem they had inherited from the previous Labour administration. Unions forcefully denied these claims and cited the sheer level of support from the women as proof there was no party-political motivation. 'Need for patience' The unions believe the action of the women has helped bring this deal about - but the administration says it was always committed to a settlement. Now the unions and the council have put such arguments in a past and issued a joint statement on the agreement. However, assuming the deal goes through, the claimants will need to be patient. The statement speaks of payments ""this calendar year"" but in ""the next financial year"". In other words - sometime between April and December. But after such a long battle, waiting a few more months may seem like a small ask.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trial raises Parkinson's therapy hope,"The Japanese team hope their work could lead to stem cell trials in human patients before the end of 2018. Parkinson's disease causes the progressive loss of nerve cells that release dopamine, a chemical that helps control body movement. The researchers triggered a similar loss of cells in macaque monkeys, then used human stem cells to replace them. The animals showed significant improvement in their symptoms two years after having precursor dopamine neurons derived from human stem cells transplanted into their brains. These cells - known as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells - are created by genetically reprogramming ordinary adult cells, so that they revert to an embryonic-like state. In this state, they can then be coaxed to develop into many different adult cell types - in the case of this experiment, dopamine neurons. Brain cell therapy 'promising' for Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease 'may start in gut' 'Many patients hide Parkinson's symptoms' Researcher Prof Jun Takahashi, from Kyoto University, said the work, published in the journal Nature, showed that the artificially created cells were as effective as those created naturally in the brain of the monkeys. He said: ""Because iPS cells are easy to obtain, we can standardise them to only use the best iPS cells for therapy."" Brain scans confirmed the cells were functioning as expected and not triggering a damaging immune response, or the growth of cancerous tumours, which can be associated with experimental stem cell therapies. The researchers also found that the quality of the donor cells was the key factor - not how many each monkey received. Dr Tilo Kunath, a Parkinson's UK-funded researcher at the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This is extremely promising research demonstrating that a safe and highly effective cell therapy for Parkinson's can be produced in the lab. ""Such a therapy has the potential to reverse the symptoms of Parkinson's in patients by restoring their dopamine-producing neurons. ""The next stage will be to test these therapies in a first-in-human clinical trial."" Prof Tom Foltynie, of the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery, said there would be concerns about how stem cell transplants might pan out in human Parkinson's patients, but the latest work had addressed some of the previous uncertainty about whether it was safe to use iPS cells. He said ""Overall, the results they report in the short term are encouraging and provide some reassurance that these cells can function as sources of dopamine to address those movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease that relate to dopamine loss. ""No-one expects that transplants will address the non-dopamine, non-movement aspects of Parkinson's disease such as dementia and falls, which ultimately emerge with very long-term follow up.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Royal Liverpool Hospital: Structural flaws at Â£335m hospital,"Building work at the already delayed new Royal Liverpool Hospital was halted in February last year after Carillion's collapse. The review by structural engineers from Arup found three of 11 floors require strengthening. The hospital was originally due to open in March 2017. Dr Peter Williams, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, said a new completion date had not been set to avoid ""raising expectations"". The work will involve ""stripping back"" areas that were near to completion, the trust said. The Department of Health has been contacted for a response on behalf of Carillion. Repeatedly delayed The project, a 646-bed hospital originally expected to cost Â£335m, has been repeatedly delayed after asbestos was found on site and remedial building work was also needed. Structural work, which will begin later this month, includes strengthening existing beams, reducing loads and putting in additional support for torsions, Jim Bell, director of structural engineers for Arup, said. Mr Bell said it was ""highly complex"" and required more than 220 cubic metres of new concrete and 165 tonnes of new fabricated steelwork. New contractors Laing O'Rourke, who also built Liverpool One and Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said they were working to finish the building ""to the high standards required"". Control measures are already in place so that there are no immediate risks to workers in the building, project director Andy Thomson added. Some of the cladding of the new hospital will be removed for access. Dr Williams said: ""Once the programme [to complete the new Royal] is finalised and the costs are all accounted for we'll confirm timescales and costs. ""We owe it to everyone to not raise expectations with speculation, until everything is signed, sealed and delivered. ""Our priority is to deliver the state of the art facilities that our patients need and the world class hospital we've all been waiting for."" Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said it was a ""shambles"", adding: ""In 2010 the government reduced and took away the right of local authorities to inspect buildings in the private sector. ""That is why I'm calling for an inquiry into why this was allowed to happen."" Dame Louise Ellman, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said: ""Carillion's calamitous collapse left Liverpool in the lurch."" ""It is deeply disappointing that the discovery of significant construction defects will result in further delay,"" she added. ""The new Royal should have opened two years ago. ""It is vital for the necessary work to be completed as a matter of urgency, so that the people of Liverpool can have this much-needed new facility.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook testing 'downvote' button,"However, the social network denied that the new feature was a ""dislike"" button, which many Facebook users have requested. The downvote button is being tried out by a small number of US users. The company also announced a number of other measures aimed at improving the Facebook community. The social network confirmed the test to news site Tech Crunch. ""We are exploring a feature for people to give us feedback about comments on public page posts. This is running for a small set of people in the US only,"" the company said in a statement. Other social sites such as Reddit have a ""downvote"" option that reduces the visibility of unpopular posts. When Facebook's downvote button is clicked, the selected comment is hidden. People can then decide whether to flag a post as ""offensive"", ""misleading"" or ""off-topic"". However, it does not affect the visibility of the post for other people and does not affect its ranking in the news feed. Responsibility Martin Garner, tech analyst at CCS Insight, said the button appeared to be part of Facebook's continued resistance to labelling itself a publisher. ""It has become very clear that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want Facebook to have the responsibility of identifying what is offensive or misleading - and what is not - because that would put him into the position of being a publisher rather than a platform,"" he said. ""He doesn't want to do that as it takes the business in a different direction - so he is leaning on the community to do it. ""It is an open question as to whether that's the right answer or not but that's where this fits in."" On Friday, the company also announced it would double the number of engineers it employs in London to develop solutions to the problems Facebook faces. It declined to share how many additional engineers it was hiring, but said the move was an investment to ""remove bad content from the platform"". ""Whether it's scamming, bullying, harassment or false news, they will work with experts to understand the issue, identify the pattern and build a solution,"" said Facebook's Chris Cox. Cash for causes It also announced a $10million (Â£7m) fund that it will give away to community groups in a bid to tackle political ""polarisation"". ""Non-political communities such as churches, sports groups, parenting groups, dog walkers - these are the natural antidote to polarisation,"" said Mr Cox. ""One of the best things we can do is help people meet others who aren't like them. Groups are most effective when they bring people together offline. They're a chance for people to bond over something they do share."" Facebook Groups will be able to apply for a slice of the fund. Five community leaders will be given $1m (or about Â£715,000 in the UK) to further their causes. Up to 100 additional groups will receive up to $50,000 (or Â£35,000 in the UK).

Fishermen's fears over wind farm off County Down coast,"By Julian O'NeillBBC NI business correspondent A consortium, First Flight Wind, is behind the project that could see up to 100 turbines constructed off the south-east coast of County Down. But a fishing organisation said the area is ""one of the most intensely fished grounds"" in the British Isles, particularly for prawns. The development still has to secure planning consent and other approvals. Alan McCulla, of the Anglo North Irish Fish Producers Organisation, said: ""We are in dialogue with government and if we have to move lines on a map we will identify other areas where this can go for the benefit of Northern Ireland and the industry."" In 2011, the Crown Estate, which owns the UK sea bed, identified the zone, and a year later First Flight Wind was selected to operate the project within its boundaries. If they secure the relevant approvals the farm would be operational by 2020, cutting Northern Ireland's dependence on imported fuel to run its power stations. It would also help Stormont meet renewable energy targets. The turbines would be visible from land, but would be at least five miles out to sea. 'Sheer fear' Preparatory work is under way, including dialogue with fishing communities in Kilkeel, County Down, and elsewhere. Mr McCulla said fishermen are not against wind farms in principle, but claimed ""fishing activity was totally ignored when this site was identified"". He is worried by experiences around other off-shore wind farms in the UK, which he claims have changed fishing patterns. ""The question is why? Is it the sheer fear of fishermen having to navigate through a forest of wind turbines or do shell fish stocks not recover after construction activity?"" But staff at First Flight Wind hope they can accommodate the industry's reservations. ""We recognise in certain circumstances like adverse weather it is more difficult to fish, potentially, within a wind farm,"" said spokesman Michael Harper. ""It is very important to sit down with fishermen during this design phase so we can work out how best to design a project that meets their needs and locate it to avoid the areas of most significant fishing activity."" Fishermen could receive compensation during the construction phase because an exclusion zone would be in place for safety purposes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

'The power of connection' Prince Harry and Meghan did not interview them, instead asking the guests to record themselves to avoid what the duke describes as ""the awkward dance of a video chat"". Meghan says their responses ""all came back to one thing - to the power of connection"". She adds: ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that."" Prince Harry says he wants to pass on a lesson from 2020 ""about how important it is to take care of one another and how meaningful our connections are, even when they're physically impossible"".

When the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals, they said they would work to become ""financially independent"". The Spotify deal followed a separate deal to make a range of documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming for Netflix.

Mental health: Pregnancy,"Smaller studies echo this finding. It is also clear many women experience stress, anxiety and other forms of emotional distress and mental illness at this and at other times during pregnancy. Researchers have found if a woman is very anxious during pregnancy, it increases the risk of her baby developing behavioural problems later in life. Heightened maternal anxiety can also affect the stress response of the baby because stress hormones cross the placenta. Depression during pregnancy can affect about 15 out of every 100 women. Laurence Reed discussed the issue during his monthly mental health phone-in on BBC Radio Cornwall. You can listen again on the BBC's iplayer. How mental health is affected during pregnancy can depend on many things: Mental health after child birth More than half of new mums experience the baby blues. It usually starts three to four days after birth. A new mother can have mood swings, bursting into tears easily, or feeling irritable, low or anxious at times. It usually stops by the time the new baby is 10-days-old. Postnatal depression (PND) PND usually begins sometime during the first six months after birth. It can affect up to 20% of new mothers. There are many symptoms, including: Many possible causes for PND have been suggested. There is probably no single reason. Postpartum or Puerperal Psychosis This is the most severe type of mental illness that happens after having a baby. It affects one in 1,000 women. There are many possible symptoms. A sufferer can experience psychotic symptoms, who may see or hear things that are not there. Women who have had previous episodes of severe mental illness - particularly bipolar disorder - are at high risk of postpartum psychosis. Although it is a serious condition, the vast majority of women make a full recovery. The sooner sufferers seek help, the better. The treatment offered will depend on how unwell the patient is. It includes: counselling, cognitive behaviour therapy, support groups and anti-depressants. Anti-depressants take at least two weeks to start working. Patients will need to take them for about six months. Hormones have been suggested as a treatment for PND. However, there is little evidence that they work. They have their own dangers, particularly if they user has had thrombosis.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Plan for Scottish opt-out organ donation system published,"At present, people must opt in to the system in order to donate their organs for transplants after they die. Under the proposals published at the Scottish Parliament, it will be assumed people were in favour of donation unless they have stated otherwise. Medics will still check with families to confirm the deceased person's views, and ensure they understand the process. Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said the move was ""part of driving a long-term change in attitudes towards organ and tissue donation"". Currently, 45% of the Scottish population have signed up for the organ donor card scheme, although the number of donors has increased by 89% over the past decade. The Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Bill follows similar legislation passed in Wales in 2015, and allows parts of an adult's body to be used in transplants in the absence of express permission. However, it includes provisions to make sure the wishes of families and next of kin continue to be respected, and excludes children and adults who do not have the capacity to understand the rules. Ms Campbell said: ""Organ and tissue donation is an incredible gift. Importantly, under the proposed system, people will still be able to make a choice about donation as they can now and there are safeguards to ensure their wishes are followed. ""I would encourage people to continue to make a decision about donation and to tell their family. ""Organ donation can only occur in tragic circumstances, and every donor, supported by their family, makes a selfless decision that can save other people's lives."" Less than 1% of people die in circumstances that enable organ donation to take place, as potential donors usually have to be in an intensive care unit at the time and there may be medical reasons that mean organs are unsuitable for transplantation. MSPs considered an opt-out system in the previous parliamentary term, but narrowly rejected a member's bill from Labour's Anne McTaggart due to ""serious concerns"" about the ""practical impact of the specific details"". Ministers promised to consider the idea, and have brought forward their own legislation with the backing of British Medical Association Scotland and 82% of respondents in a consultation. There have been calls for other parts of the UK to follow the Welsh model, and MPs have backed making a similar change in England. A study of the Welsh system found that it had not increased the number of donors across its first two years, although Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said it was ""too early to know the true impact"" of the change.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Newspaper headlines: Trump 'eyes NHS' and Johnson's PM pitch,"By BBC NewsStaff ""Trump demands access to NHS funding as price of Brexit trade deal"" is the i's interpretation. The Guardian adds that Mrs May appeared to explain to Mr Trump what the NHS was, before he said that ""everything was on the table"". The Daily Mirror gives its verdict on the comment with the headline ""Butt out, Mr President"". The Washington Post notes that even though the president later appeared to have a change of heart, his comments about the NHS have riled politicians on both sides of the political spectrum by touching on one of the most sacrosanct aspects of British life. With the caption ""Meddling Don Steams in"" - the Sun claims Mr Trump has caused ""havoc"" in the Tory leadership race to replace Mrs May. It says he broke diplomatic protocol by agreeing to meet three of the candidates - Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove - and ignoring the eight others. Huffpost UK takes a similar line and says the president was in a ""playful mood"" but spent the day effectively looking over Mrs May's shoulder, ""surveying her potential successors"". The Daily Mail reports that the president was snubbed by Boris Johnson so he could make a leadership pitch to more than 80 Tory MPs. The Mail and the Daily Telegraph both say Mr Johnson's message was that any further delays to Brexit could wipe out the party - and that he was the man to put Nigel Farage ""back in his box"". Writing on the New Statesman website, Patrick Maguire says that, on audience numbers, Mr Johnson was the clear winner of the four candidates speaking - attracting more than 100 MPs - while only 42 stayed to hear Andrea Leadsom. The Times believes Mr Johnson's campaign to become prime minister has received a significant boost - with the backing of a number of moderate MPs it describes as ""rising stars"".

Francois Fillon's wife facing payment investigation,"It comes after Le Canard Enchaine claimed Penelope Fillon earned about 500,000 euros (Â£430,000) as her husband's assistant in Parliament. The newspaper has questioned how much work she did for the money. Mr Fillon said he was ""outraged by the contempt and misogyny"" in the story. Le Canard Enchaine alleged that Mrs Fillon, who was born in Wales, had been paid from money available to her husband as an MP for the Sarthe region in northern France. The newspaper, which said it had access to her payslips, claimed that she earned a total of about 500,000 euros in three periods between 1998 and 2012. But it said reporters had been unable to find any witnesses to her work. In a press release, the national financial prosecutor's office said it had opened a preliminary investigation into suspicions of ""embezzlement of public funds, misuse of company assets and concealment of these offences"". Wasteful public spending But speaking to reporters at a campaign event in Bordeaux, centre-right presidential candidate Mr Fillon compared the newspaper report to a stink bomb. He said: ""I won't make any comment because there is nothing to comment on. But I'm outraged by the contempt and the misogyny in this story. Just because she is my wife she should not be entitled to work?"" Mr Fillon's staff have previously said that his wife worked for him in a common and legal arrangement used by many MPs. The BBC's Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, said the story had potential to do serious damage to the Fillon campaign - reminding a public that feels deeply hostile to establishment politicians that the candidate is very much part of the system. The 62-year-old candidate for the right-wing Republicans party has criticised wasteful public spending and plans to cut 500,000 civil service jobs if elected.

Abusive Birmingham husband 'beat wife and locked her indoors',"Aziz Rehman, 47, would only allow partner Zeenit Bibi to leave their home in Collingbourne Avenue, Hodge Hill, Birmingham when on the school run. He would wedge twigs in the front door whenever he went out so he could tell if she had left the house. Rehman was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday to three years and nine months in prison. A jury found the businessman guilty in May of assault and coercive control. Mrs Bibi, 36, who married Rehman in December 2000, told the BBC she wanted other victims to speak out. ""I didn't think anybody was going to believe me, which was one of the reasons that I left it so long, because in the outside world he made it look like we were the perfect family,"" she said. ""Nobody deserves this kind of life - talk about it, let somebody know. ""I had dumbbells put on my head, I had a foldable chair hit on my knee, I wasn't walking properly. ""I wasn't allowed to go the doctor, I wasn't allowed to be in the hospital. ""My ribs were done in, my knees were done in, and I told people 'it's OK - I fell over the lawnmower'."" Judge Roderick Henderson told Rehmen - who owns Arden Superstore and off licence in Arden Road, Saltley - that he controlled his wife ""as property"". He said: ""People are entitled to a basic level of respect from partners, not to be assaulted, bullied and controlled."" Rehman, who denied the charges, ran their home like a ""prison"". One regular visitor told police how the curtains were always drawn and described him as an ""oppressor"". Mrs Bibi alerted West Midlands Police in July 2016 while her husband was out of the country and he was arrested following his return to the UK. PC Maria Watts said Mrs Bibi was ""tormented throughout her marriage"". ""She was forbidden from seeing friends and family, regularly assaulted, denied access to a mobile phone, and was effectively living a life of domestic servitude,"" she said. ""She went 16 years without seeing her family even though some lived just a few miles away.""

R.I.P. Car tax disc,"Magazine MonitorA collection of cultural artefacts Tax disc, and its close relation Vehicle Excise Duty, were introduced in the UK in the Roads Act 1920. Its original role in life was to pay for the building and upkeep of roads, but since 1937 the proceeds have been dropped into a big Treasury pot - something mourners may bear in mind when contemplating their comedy disc holders for the last time, with their declaration: ""I've paid my tax, now fix some [unrepeatable adjective] pot holes."" Or when shouting similar indignant sentiments (with adjectives) at cyclists. The truth is that Tax Disc money is as likely to be paying for canal dredging or bank regulation as it is for cats' eyes. Its friends may point to its one big advantage - the ability to shop annoying neighbours to the council - but for many drivers Tax Disc was always an easy way to induce low-level paranoia. Firstly, there was the awkward process of separating the perforated disc from its square setting without ripping the thing in two. But there was also the worry about displaying the right disc at the right time. For the most fastidious of motorists, this could mean creeping out in pyjamas at midnight on the appointed date to replace it. There was also the process of trying to make sure the plastic holder stuck to the windscreen, and the possibility of small children developing an interest in taking the disc in and out of the holder and replacing it backwards, later costing their father Â£60 in fines for ""failing to display"". True story. Its detractors' reasons for failing to display were listed by the DVLA earlier this year, when it published the top 10 excuses for not renewing. They included ""I fell out of a tree picking plums and broke both my arms"", and ""I took too much Viagra and couldn't leave the house"". No flowers. Add your tributes using the form on the right. Six months, a year at most, they said. Mike , Newcastle upon Tyne. The disc was like a giant round stamp and would take a lot of licking. Keith, Hull, UK Disc expired whilst on Duty.

Coronation Street explores right to die,"Spoiler alert: This story contains plot details Hayley, the first transgender character in a British soap, has been diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. The show has revealed that as her health deteriorates she will decide she wants to take her own life. Both sides of the 'right to die' debate will be shown as her husband Roy is vehemently against her decision. Coronation Street Producer Stuart Blackburn said: ""This is a very sensitive issue and we will be exploring the effects of her decision on husband Roy who has a huge emotional and moral dilemma over her choice to die this way."" Blackburn said Hayley becomes very concerned about losing control as the disease progresses. ""The palliative care Hayley receives is superb but she is scared that the pain relief can cause confusion and a loss of clarity. ""She is concerned she could regress to being Harold, she's already had one such nightmare. She wants to die in peace with clarity of thought, she wants to die as Hayley - the identity she has spent her whole life fighting for,"" he added. It was announced in January that Julie Hesmondhalgh, who has played Hayley for 15 years, is leaving the soap at the end of the year. She said filming the cancer storyline scenes were ""hard to do"" and admitted they were ""going to be pretty hard to watch"". ""I feel the storyline really honours their relationship and their love story - it's fitting and it's proper and it's what people are living with every single day and I think it's important to tell those stories,"" she said. 'Handled with care' The 'right to die' storyline has been welcomed by the campaign group Dignity in Dying. Chief Executive Sarah Wootton said they believed it will ""highlight the effects that the current out-of-date law has on terminally ill people and their families"". ""We do not know the details of the upcoming plot, but what we do know is that people are taking drastic action to have the death that they want, with one patient travelling abroad every fortnight and others asking friends or family to help them in this country,"" she added. Coronation Street has revealed the character of Hayley does not ask her husband Roy to help her in the storyline. The show's writers and producers have consulted widely with specialists and interest groups before tackling the issue. It comes at a time when an Assisted Dying Bill is to be debated in the House of Lords. A spokesman for Care Not Killing warned that while soaps should not avoid controversial subject matters, it was ""important that this issue is presented in a sensitive and careful way"" and ""handled with great care."" ""Irresponsible portrayal of the subject is the recipe for elder abuse and a threat to vulnerable people, many of whom already feel under pressure at a time of austerity and who are worried about being a burden on others,"" he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Houston Flood: Tillerson thanks Mexico for aid offer,"On Sunday Mexico offered vehicles, boats, supplies and food, reports said. Mexican Red Cross volunteers have also travelled to the flooded city of Houston. President Trump has not yet commented but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has thanked the Mexicans. ""It's very generous of the government of Mexico to offer their help at this very, very challenging time for our citizens down in Texas and now moving towards the border of Louisiana as well,"" Mr Tillerson said. It is not yet known when Mexico will provide the aid. But its government has suggested a similar mission to that sent to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when 200 Mexican troops brought food, water and medicine. A separate convoy of 33 English-speaking Mexican Red Cross volunteers left for Texas to work in Houston shelters. Some on social media pointed out that groups Mr Trump has been accused of demonising have been prominent in their offers of help for flood victims. Mr Trump has promised Mexico will pay for any border wall. But Mexico has refused and the US president has conceded that the US will have to find initial funding. He has threatened to force a federal government shutdown if funds are not allocated in the upcoming budget, but economists from investment bank Goldman Sachs say Storm Harvey has made that less likely. Mr Trump has also promised emergency funds to rebuild in Texas and Louisiana, but also plans to cut nearly $1bn from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) budget to help get work on the border barrier started, the Associated Press news agency reported. In a speech following his visit to Texas earlier this week, he told relatives of victims that ""all of America is grieving with you, and our hearts are joined with yours forever"". Parts of Texas have been hit by more than 50in of rainfall since Hurricane Harvey landed on 25 August, setting new records before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and later to a tropical depression. Thousands of people have been rescued from the floodwaters, and more than 32,000 people are being housed in emergency shelters.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Chelsea fans cheer as team parades Champions League trophy,"The team, on two open-top buses, began the procession from its Stamford Bridge home up to Parsons Green. The Blues secured victory in a clash with four-time cup winners Bayern Munich in Germany, on Saturday. Chelsea won 4-3 on penalties. It is the first time a London football club has won the European cup. Players, interim manager Roberto di Matteo and the club's owner Roman Abramovich were onboard the first bus as it made its way through the streets. The bus stopped at Eel Brook Common where team members spoke to the thousands of waiting fans. Captain John Terry, who did not play on Saturday after being suspended, took the microphone first and began chanting victory slogans, with fans joining in, as the players on the bus took turns to address them. 'Long time waiting' Fans sang ""Happy Birthday"" to goalkeeper Petr Cech and Didier Drogba, who scored two goals in the nail-biting final, sang back ""We are the Champions"". Supporters then chanted ""We want you to stay"", at the prompt of club staff on the bus. Speaking to the crowd Frank Lampard, who was the captain in the final, said: ""We've been here a long time waiting to win this thing and it was the most amazing night of all of our careers. ""And we're just so pleased to come back here and celebrate with all our fans. ""You've been amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The best club in the world - easy."" Fans dressed in the Chelsea strip created a sea of blue all along the route of the parade. And as the cup was handed to di Matteo, a huge cheer went up in the crowd. The team's bus, decked in club colours with Champions of Europe written in the front, stopped all the way along the route as players lift the trophy for their supporters. Fans waved flags and threw celery at the players, as a mark of respect - a tradition that began in the late 1980s, when supporters started throwing sticks in the air, accompanied by a song. David and Mary Fergus had travelled from Southampton, Hampshire, to be at the parade. Mr Fergus, 40, an IT consultant, said: ""I'm still blinking in disbelief that we actually won it. ""We definitely rode our luck but I think it was one of those things that was written in the stars. ""A great atmosphere here and I hope the lads on the bus enjoy today, they've earned it."" Close to 70,000 fans turned out for Chelsea's last victory parade in 2010 after the team won the Premier League and FA Cup.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Anti-transgender' bus is met by protests in Boston,"The bright orange bus criticises what it calls ""gender ideology"" with the words ""you can't change sex"" and ""it's biology"" on its side. It closely resembles a Spanish bus created by a Catholic group that was forced off the roads by protesters. The US bus was vandalised at its first stop in New York. It is sponsored by conservative action groups the National Organization for Marriage, Citizen Go and the International Organization for the Family. The organisers say it is aimed at promoting ""the truth of gender"" which they say is ""determined by biology rather than by emotions and feelings"". Speaking while the transgender flag was raised over over City Hall, Boston's mayor Marty Walsh said: ""We are listening to our transgender community by making the city more inclusive. ""Its important for us to every now and then send a message, to let people know we will not be intimidated by discrimination or harassment. ""When you deny the experience of transgender individuals, you are denying the experience of basic human civil rights - in Boston and Massachusetts we are better than that. ""Together we are going to continue to fight intolerance with love and acceptance, and we will continue to fly this flag with pride in our hearts."" Protesters surrounded the bus at the Massachusetts State House in Boston and in neighbouring Cambridge, near Harvard University. One protester wrote #HateSpeechBus on the bus in response to the campaign's slogan #FreeSpeechBus. A spokesman for the National Organization for Marriage told the BBC he was ""disappointed that people who preach tolerance and acceptance reacted to the bus by lashing out"". The spokesman insisted a significant proportion of the US population felt ""uncomfortable"" about the prospect of transgender people using public facilities such as changing rooms and bathrooms. He said the vandalism of the bus showed how ""people with alternative point of view on transgender issues are treated"", and called for their opinion to be treated with respect. The group had previously described the incident in New York as a ""vicious assault"" by ""LGBT extremists"" but said it was committed to continuing the East Coast tour. The bus will now travel to Connecticut, Philadelphia and Baltimore before its final stop in Washington DC.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rochdale Council leaders 'let down' groomed girls,"The review was ordered by the council after nine men were jailed last year for grooming and abusing teenage girls in and around the town. Jim Taylor, chief executive, said the council had let down some children. He said the review painted a poor image of how parts of the council was run but said it had improved its procedures. The 136-page report by independent consultants made 16 recommendations and said the council should have done more to deal with the issue of grooming sooner. 'Deeply sorry' The report said even though the problem was not recognised nationally until 2008, local councils in Lancashire close to Rochdale had already started tackling the issue. Mr Taylor said: ""It is clear from this review that some children were let down by Rochdale Council. ""On behalf of the council, I am deeply sorry these young people did not get the care and support they deserved. ""This review paints a poor picture of the way elements of Rochdale Council has previously been run. ""Hard-working, dedicated staff were also let down by some senior managers who appear to have shown no leadership and taken no responsibility. I am absolutely determined to ensure these mistakes are never repeated."" The court case last May heard five girls aged between 13 and 15 were given alcohol, food and money in return for sex by men of Pakistani and Afghan origin, in and around Rochdale in 2008 and 2009. It sparked a national debate after Baroness Warsi said a ""small minority"" of Pakistani men saw white girls as ""fair game"" and Blackburn MP Jack Straw said some men of Pakistani origin saw white girls as ""easy meat"". 'Damning indictment' However Rochdale Council leader Colin Lambert has said he ""strongly"" disagrees the scandal could be described as an ""Asian crime"" as it happened ""across all communities"". A previous review by the Rochdale Safeguarding Children Board found staff who failed to act had said the girls were making ""lifestyle choices"". Rochdale's Labour MP Simon Danczuk said the latest report was a ""damning indictment"" of the council and it was ""wrong"" that senior officers who presided over services that failed children had been allowed to escape disciplinary action by taking early retirement. He called for systems to be put in place to claw back their ""enormous"" pension funds. ""This report shows that there were alarm bells going off all over the place and they were ignored,"" he said. ""Senior officers turned a blind eye to child abuse and didn't want to know. ""The perpetrators of these terrible crimes and some senior council officers have brought shame on our town. ""All they needed to do was listen to the victims.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Abuse inquiry: Legal action threat from 'left out' survivors,"By Reevel AldersonBBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Survivors group White Flowers Alba said it was seeking a judicial review because the inquiry will not look at their cases. It claimed this was ""unfair"" as similar investigations elsewhere in the UK were looking at all instances of abuse. The Scottish government said the inquiry must focus on a set time frame. The public inquiry was ordered in December last year and followed allegations which emerged in a BBC Scotland investigation of institutional abuse at a former Catholic boarding school at Fort Augustus in the Highlands. It is headed by Susan O'Brien QC and will take up to four years to report. It formally began its work last month. But White Flowers Alba has said its remit was too narrow. The inquiry does include: However, it does not include other places where abuse may have happened such as: Father Gerry Magee, a parish priest in Kilwinning in Ayrshire, is a spokesman for the survivors group. He said: ""It really is like a postcode lottery- if you happen to be in an institution which the inquiry acknowledges and recognises then they will inquire into your abuse but if not, if you were abused in a parish or any other institution - the Scouts or whatever or the church - then you're left out of the inquiry. ""Surely that in itself is a massive injustice."" The Scottish government said the child abuse inquiry was the widest it had ever ordered. A spokeswoman added: ""The initial call was for an inquiry into the abuse of children in institutional care. ""We have listened carefully to survivors of abuse and responded to their request for the scope to be widened. ""This is why the inquiry will now consider instances of the abuse of children in a wide range of care settings. For the inquiry to succeed and reach clear conclusions it needs to focus on an explicit remit within a set time frame."" However, many survivors feel it does not go far enough. They said they had been let down and were now considering legal action. Andi Lavery, an abuse survivor and spokesman for White Flowers, said: ""We should be pushing at an open door on this. Scottish society shouldn't be watching from the sidelines. ""They have to help survivors and prevent further survivors dying instead of leaving us to fight out this endless horrific battle of facing this on our own.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police Ombudsman to resume RUC misconduct investigations,"Investigations were suspended in 2011 after a critical report into the running of the office. The report found that the independence of the office had been compromised. Many of the cases involve allegations of security force collusion. At the time the ombudsman was Al Hutchinson. The critical report into his office was carried out by the then criminal justice inspector, Michael Maguire, who replaced Mr Hutchinson as police ombudsman in July 2012. The report said there had been a lowering of operational independence between the ombudsman and the police, and that investigations into historical events should be suspended. The criticism contributed to the early retirement of Mr Hutchinson. A follow-up inspection report published on Wednesday concluded that enough improvements have been made for historical investigations to resume. Dr Maguire said his previous role had given him an ""understanding of the issues that needed to be addressed"". ""The office has worked very hard over the last year to put some of those issues in a way which repositions the office to be able to recommence these investigations again,"" he said. ""I welcome the CJI (Criminal Justice Inspection) report because I think it's the first stage in rebuilding confidence in the office and the work that it does."" Six years He said work had been done to make improvements across a range of areas. ""We've recruited a significant number of new staff who have direct experience in major investigations, changed the ways we prioritise cases, introduced thorough investigative process which are subject to ongoing and systemic review and we've developed a consistent approach to communication for the families,"" he said. The ombudsman's office has been given Â£12m to complete more than 150 historical cases over the next six years. Dr Maguire admitted that the number of cases to examine was ""ambitious"". ""At the beginning of exercise we will be doing a lot of review work which collects investigative material,"" he said. ""Many of those cases, in some cases 20 or 30 complaints, can be clustered around a particular core issue and be dealt with on an ongoing basis. ""I think given those two reasons we're in a much better place to be able to look at these cases in a shorter time frame than has been before."" However, the DUP's Paul Givan raised concerns about the re-opening of historical investigations. He said it had ""the potential to once again damage confidence in the ombudsman's office"". ""The DUP has consistently argued the police ombudsman should solely focus upon dealing with present day complaints into the PSNI and de-couple it from historical investigations which has marred this office in controversy from its inception,"" he said. ""As a result of this decision the ombudsman office will become the subject of intense political scrutiny and debate that will only serve to distract from the important oversight role it has for effectively dealing with modern day policing issues.

Infant classes over 30 almost treble in five years,"By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Some 72,000 infant pupils in England are now in large classes, up from 24,700 in 2008, suggests data from the Department for Education (DfE). The previous government banned classes of more than 30 for this age group, unless under exceptional circumstances. A DfE spokeswoman said classes often fall back to 30 ""after a year or two"". A rising birth-rate and more immigration have led to a shortage of primary school places in England. In March, the National Audit Office predicted a need for an extra 240,000 primary places by next year. 'Real strain' The spending watchdog said that one in five primary schools was full or near capacity with signs of ""real strain"" on places. In 2008, there were 730 infant classes with more than 30 pupils, representing 1.7% of the total. By 2013, this had risen to 2,299 ""over-sized"" classes, 4.1% of the total. The jump has been particularly sharp in the past year. In January 2013 an extra 24,645 infants were being taught in over-sized classes compared with January 2012. This represents an increase of 52%. The average infant class now stands at 27.3 pupils, up from 27.2 in 2012 and 25.7 in 2008, according to the figures. The coalition government relaxed rules brought in under Labour which said that if a class went over 30 pupils it had to be brought down to below the limit the following year, except under exceptional circumstances. The current rules allow schools to have larger classes for longer under a wider range of circumstances, for example to accommodate children from military families. The government says the most common reason for over-sized classes is admissions panels allowing appeals by parents. Schools expand A DfE spokeswoman said the government expected an extra 190,000 school places to have been created by September. ""Children are only permitted to join classes of 30 pupils in exceptional cases, if, for instance, they are in care or from military families. Classes often fall back naturally to 30 over a year or two. ""We are spending Â£5bn by 2015 on creating new school places, more than double the amount spent by the previous government in the same time frame. We are also building free schools and letting the most popular schools expand to meet demand from parents."" Russell Hobby of the National Association of Head Teachers said: ""Primary schools are beginning to experience pressure on places from the population boom and this is leading to larger infant classes. ""Class size is not the be-all-and-end-all for education standards. Other factors matter more, but very large classes are neither safe nor productive.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Monty the osprey of Springwatch fame returns to Dyfi reserve,"Monty, or Maldwyn in Welsh, has been tidying the nest they share at the Dyfi Osprey Project near Machynlleth. He and Nora have raised four chicks at the Cors Dyfi reserve but she has yet to arrive back home. Meanwhile a goshawk in a south Wales forest, one of only 500 breeding pairs in the UK, has laid her first egg. In mid Wales, Monty had his first full weekend at home since returning to the reserve. Wardens say the returnee was able to go fishing despite it being windy and he continued with his nest renovations. Monty became a hit with Springwatch viewers as he and Nora struggled to raise their second brood through the bad weather of 2012. One chick died soon after birth and contact has since been lost with the other two who fledged the nest and made their way abroad on migratory routes. Warden Emyr Evans is hopeful that Monty and Nora's older first chick Einion will also return to the area if only to scout for a suitable habitat for himself and a partner next year. But Mr Evans said all their eyes are upwards to see if Nora will find her way home and pair up again. He said: ""The wind is favouring migratory birds now so she could be on her way."" ""The easterly winds have held up a lot of migratory birds, not just ospreys. Swallows, martins, warblers, they've all been caught up. 'Weather conditions' ""The weather has been changing in the last few days so hopefully that means she is on her way. ""The conditions now are good for the ospreys to return."" The project funded by Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust had around 40,000 visitors last year to watch the live web stream from the nest. A fourth camera and a microphone have been added this year. In south Wales, staff at Cwmcarn Forest Visitor Centre near Newport can already boast one new egg by their rare bird. Once close to extinction, goshawks are known as ""the phantoms of the forest"" because of their elusiveness despite their size. A pair dubbed Genevieve and Fred has made their home in a larch tree in the forest. 'Taste for squirrels' Since 2011 their home life has been watched via a ""nest cam"" and on Monday viewers saw Genevieve lay her first egg of 2013. Spokesperson Anna Gambarina said: ""We don't know how many she's going to lay. Last year she laid five but only two chicks survived. ""Thanks to images provided by the camera we have been able to share a unique insight into these creatures lives, from their taste for squirrels to the heartache of chicks dying.

"Alun Cairns: Trial row ex-minister paid Â£16,000 after resignation","A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan MP said the payment was ""in common with the departure of every minister"". Mr Cairns resigned in November over claims he knew about a former aide's role in the collapse of a rape trial. He insisted he did not know the details of the case. An annual accounts report from the UK government's Wales Office, published last month, says Mr Cairns' ministerial salary for 2019-20 of Â£57,379 included the ""compensation payment"" of Â£16,876. The full annual salary for this role, which he received in 2018-19, is Â£67,505. Government ministers are entitled to these salaries on top of their salaries as MPs. From 1 April 2019, the basic annual salary for an MP is Â£79,468 plus expenses. A spokesman for Mr Cairns said the compensation payment after his resignation was ""in common with the departure of every minister from the Welsh or UK government and has been in place for decades, from Rhodri Morgan to Peter Hain"". A UK government spokesperson said: ""Severance payments for ministers who leave government are made automatically as set out in the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991."" Why did he resign? In April 2018, Mr Cairns' former aide, Ross England, made claims about a woman's sexual history during the rape trial of his friend James Hackett, causing the case to collapse. Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. In December 2018, Mr England was then selected as the Vale of Glamorgan candidate for the 2021 Welsh Parliament elections. At the time of his selection, Mr Cairns endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". The former Welsh Secretary denied knowing about Mr England's role in the collapse of the case, but BBC Wales saw an email sent to him in August 2018 which mentioned the matter. Mr England was suspended as a candidate and as an employee after details of the court case emerged, with the party saying a full investigation would be conducted. A UK government Cabinet Office investigation was launched following Mr Cairns' resignation from Boris Johnson's cabinet in November. Mr Cairns was cleared of breaking the ministerial code, but an inquiry found it ""unlikely"" he had not been made aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse. The rape victim previously told BBC Wales that she was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the investigation's conclusion.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Peckham baby death attack: Accused 'not ready to be father',"Malorie Bantala, 22, from Peckham, suffered life-threatening injuries and gave birth at 32 weeks to a stillborn boy following the attack. Kevin Wilson, and a 17-year-old boy, allegedly wore helmets and attacked her when she refused a termination. Both defendants deny grievous bodily harm and child destruction. 'Cowardly and callous' The court heard on 15 June Mr Wilson, of Longfield Estate, Bermondsey, and the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Miss Bantala in the street near her south London home. They focused the attack on her stomach, jurors were told. Jonathan Rees QC for the prosecution said: ""It was a cowardly and callous attack, each male wearing a motorcycle helmet in an apparent effort to conceal his identity. ""It is the prosecution case that one of the attackers was the unborn baby's father - Kevin Wilson. ""He had made it clear that he didn't want the baby to be born and was not pleased when Miss Bantala informed others that he was the father. ""We say that he took matters into his own hands and decided that he would end the pregnancy by violence,"" he said. 'Vicious blows' Jurors were told Miss Bantala and Mr Wilson, a teaching assistant, met in the summer of 2011, ahead of their first term at the University of Bedfordshire in Luton, and had a casual relationship over the following few years. In December 2014, Miss Bantala, then 21, phoned Mr Wilson to tell him she was pregnant and that he was the father, but he replied saying ""why are you doing this to me?"" and told her he was not ready. During the attack, the court was told, Miss Bantala recognised the taller male as her ex-boyfriend. She was said to have been knocked to the ground and ""vicious blows"" rained on her as she curled up trying to protect her stomach. The prosecutor said the victim shouted ""Kevin"" to get them to stop. Neighbours who saw the attack heard her scream and shout ""Kevin, I'm going to kill you, watch"". When emergency services arrived, Miss Bantala told police her ex-boyfriend was responsible for the attack, adding: ""He doesn't want the baby."" At the hospital doctors were unable to find the baby boy's heartbeat and he was stillborn. Denying allegations, Mr Wilson told police he was visiting his brother and a friend on his estate.

Ipswich Hospital 'now meets standards' - CQC,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the hospital was fully compliant in the areas they inspected in July. Previous CQC reports in May and November 2011 found failings in standards in some areas. The hospital said staff had been working towards the improvements ""for many months"". The CQC report in May said the hospital had failed to meet the required standard of food and drink provision and dignity for patients. The November report said these standards had been met, but it was failing to carry out appropriate mental health assessments with other agencies, but this had now been addressed. 'Turned the corner' ""It's about seeing the person, not just another patient,"" said a hospital spokeswoman. ""We've changed our leadership and worked with agencies like Age UK and Suffolk Family Carers among others to ensure we get this right and these improvements have been recognised by the CQC."" Dr Dan Poulter, Conservative MP for Mid Suffolk and North Ipswich, said: ""I think it's very good news and it reflects that after a difficult period Ipswich Hospital has now very much turned the corner and is looking towards a very optimistic future. ""One of the key things has been changes in management. It was the right thing to do and patients and staff are now benefiting from this change in leadership."" Five inspectors visited 13 wards and departments on 26 July. The report found standards were also being met in the areas of nutrition and care and welfare of people who use services. 'Palpable improvements' Cleanliness and infection control, the support given to workers and communication between staff and patients were also praised. Cath Gorman, associate director of nursing and quality, said: ""This is fantastic news for our hospital, our patients, staff and our whole community.

The proposed charges come as the council needs to find saving Â£17m over three years. The plans include introducing on-street parking charges in Barry, Penarth, Cowbridge and Llantwit Major. 'Killing a village' Ms Rogers, who works for a development firm in Llantwit Major, said: ""I work in the town, and park in the public car park behind my office every day, if I have to pay to park there, I've worked out that I wouldn't start seeing my wages until lunchtime on a Monday. ""And that doesn't even begin to mention the impact it will have on the town's economy or community morale; we've just come out of a recession and if people are put off from coming here to shop or visit the beach, it will ruin the local economy. ""It'll be like killing a village."" Jacqui Jenkins, who lives in Cowbridge and owns a hair salon, says the potential charges would have a considerable impact on her business. ""One of the biggest issues for me as a business owner is staff retention, and if my staff have to pay every day to park their cars when they come into work, it'll put them off commuting and that's one less reason for them to work here. ""It would put pressure on me to raise their wages to keep them, which will then be reflected in the prices my customers have to pay."" However Jayne Nicholas, from I.G Nicholas Butchers in Cowbridge, has said the potential charges could be a good thing for her business. ""A lot of people use the car parks here, and if the charges came in, it could put people off using them which would free up spaces for our customers to use instead."" Public consultation underway A Vale of Glamorgan spokesman said: ""The proposals outlined in the Draft Parking Strategy are for parking in town centres to remain free for an initial period after which charges will apply. ""Although this would be a new strategy in the Vale, parking charges are commonplace in town centres and coastal locations across the country. The public consultation runs until Friday 28 September, with drop-in sessions taking place in Barry, Penarth, Llantwit Major, and Cowbridge as well as Cosmeston Country Park, Porthkerry Country Park and Southerndown.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Zimbabwe media slow to cover military takeover,"By BBC MonitoringThe world through its media State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that the military had taken over but offered little by way of updates to the situation. For most of the morning the TV played patriotic songs from the independence period of the 1980s before resuming normal programming. The lunchtime news featured the army takeover as the main story. The print edition of the government-owned daily The Herald appeared on the streets on Wednesday morning with Tuesday's stories which downplayed the importance of the warning by the head of the armed forces Constantino Chiwenga that the military would take over if necessary. The paper's online edition took a few hours to update, and has been carrying coverage of the unfolding events, under the headline Live and developing: No Military Takeover in Zim. Apart from carrying the military statement the paper said: ""The situation in Harare's central business district is calm with people going about their business."" Social media users have been trying to make up for the lack of news by posting their own observations and pictures of street scenes in the capital Harare, including some of troops and police being made to sit in a line outside parliament and people going about their daily lives. The 'smoothest' coup Many have dismissed suggestions by the military that their actions don't amount to a coup. Using the Twitter hashtag #ZimbabweCoup, many users welcomed the developments. The hashtag had been used more than 13,000 times in the 24 hours up until noon on Wednesday, many of the users appearing to be in the country. One widely shared and liked tweet with a sarcastic overtone read: ""The coup going on in Zimbabwe is the smoothest I've ever seen.. It started like we just wanna talk then went to it's cute you think you [sic] still president."" ""When you see the army commanders take over the state broadcaster airwaves then that's the confirmation it's a COUP. End of an era,"" another tweet read. (bit.ly/2hyoy64) However, another user provided a different interpretation: ""It's a Zanu PF internal putsch backed by the army - very different from a military takeover - the statement issued is so very unique - you can feel the restraint."" (bit.ly/2mt6oEl) Mufti Ismail Menk of Zimbabwe tweeted: ""#Zimbabwe is calm and life goes on for most ordinary citizens. Streets are safe and most children are in school."" Some users made fun of the fact that this morning's print editions were way out of date. ""News editors in Zim slept through the revolution. You need night shifts comrades,"" said @drDendere.

Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The UK's medicines safety regulator says there have been 242 clotting cases and 49 deaths, with 28.5 million doses of the vaccine administered. But the risk is slightly higher in younger age groups. Low levels of coronavirus cases and the availability of alternative vaccines have also informed the decision. Prof Wei Shen Lim, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said they were putting ""a high priority on safety"" and he expected the move would ""serve to boost confidence"" in the vaccination programme. Immunisation is estimated to have already saved 10,000 lives in the UK. He added: ""As Covid-19 rates continue to come under control, we are advising that adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine."" It comes as two-thirds of over-18s in the UK have now had a first dose - about 35 million people - and 31.8% or nearly 16.8 million have had both doses, according to the latest government figures. A further 15 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported on Friday, and there were 2,490 new confirmed cases. Finely balanced risks The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to distinctive, but rare, blood clots that also appear with low levels of platelets (which help clots form) in the blood. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, but rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Two in a million people in their 40s died rising to four per million people in their 30s. At the same time, the risks of developing severe Covid, if you catch the virus, fall in younger age groups. Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said the benefits continued to outweigh the risks for the ""vast majority of people"". She added: ""The balance of benefits and risks is very favourable for older people, but is more finely balanced for younger people."" The supply of alternative vaccines, including Pfizer and Moderna, has made the decision possible. The vaccination programme has also been unexpectedly successful in reducing the spread of the virus. This has changed projections for a ""third wave"" later in the year meaning the risk to younger adults is less than previously anticipated. Most clots were after the first dose and people who have already had one dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca are advised to still have the second. However, some under 40s will still be offered the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as it is easier to both transport and store, making it more practical than the alternatives. All adults are still expected to be offered their first dose of a vaccine by the end of July.

Sea search for Brighton woman is called off,"Coastguards said it was thought a couple entered the sea after a night out and the woman was swept away. Rescue teams were scrambled overnight but waves of up to 3m in height made it impossible, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. Conditions during an early daylight sweep on Saturday proved to be so poor it had to be cancelled. Helicopter search Solent Coastguard watch manager Paul Marlow said: ""We believe that a couple went in to the sea after a night out on the town. ""One managed to get back out but sadly the other was swept away. ""Gale force wind, rough seas and darkness make it difficult to spot a person in the water who needs help and so our request is simple - please don't end your night out with a dip."" Coastguard, lifeboat and police teams worked to rescue the woman and a helicopter was scrambled after the alert was raised just before 02:25 GMT. Ambulance crews were also at the scene. People at the scene tried to reach the woman, believed to be from Brighton, after she went in the sea opposite the Digital Club, west of Palace Pier. Sussex Police said that by 04:40 GMT no body or person had been recovered. 'Washed away' A police spokesman said: ""The man tried to grab her but was unable to drag her to safety. ""Police officers arrived within minutes and, together with club staff and her friend, approached the sea edge but the woman was being washed further away and was inaccessible due to the very heavy sea conditions. ""Coastguards swiftly assisted the search by land and sea but the body has not, so far, been recovered and the immediate search has been discontinued at this time."" He said it was not known why the woman went into the water but that the incident was not being treated as suspicious. Family liaison officers had contacted her next of kin, he added. Ch Supt Nev Kemp said police and coastguards searched for the woman for several hours in very difficult and dangerous weather. ""The sea was very rough indeed overnight and we always urge people to be very careful and stay away from the water's edge anywhere along the coast when the weather is so bad,"" he said. Searches continued in daylight but rescuers failed to find the woman and were stood down at 09:00. ""We will continue to be vigilant for any sightings along the beach,"" Mr Kemp added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Fiscal Phil's Budget - is it just about the cash?,"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales The Budget throws up more than enough to last a lifetime. And when there's not much money around, politicians tend to combine annual increases to give a number with more zeros. It doesn't always add to the sum of human understanding. Disraeli had a phrase for it. But then, in the post-devolution age, there are statistics that apply UK-wide, numbers that apply only in Wales and other figures that apply in Wales, England and Northern Ireland (but only for a few months). No wonder so many members of the studio audience on Wednesday's Wales Live seemed confused, often conflating UK and Welsh numbers. The UK government announced Â£1.2bn for the Welsh Government. But as we know, the extra money is over four years - during which ministers in Cardiff will spend more than Â£60bn. Most of the money has strings attached (the SNP Scottish government says it's a con). It comes in the form of ""financial transactions"" so can only be used in certain ways. Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford told my colleague Nick Servini: ""Just remember. Over half of that is money we have got to give back to the figures are not quite what they seem on the surface."" 'Sting in tail' He added, via Twitter: ""A sting in the tail - majority of additional capital funding for Wales must be repaid to UK Treasury."" Is he right? Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns told me: ""That isn't right. This is a means that we've used over the last five years because it forces the Welsh Government to invest in business, to invest in infrastructure, to invest in projects. They've said themselves that they want to move away from grants and to offer loan type structures to businesses. ""Well provided they go on re-investing to ensure that businesses and communities benefit then everyone is going to win out of this package."" It's been a crash course in government finance for some of us. My man with the spreadsheet suggests that some of the money could be handed to housing associations to build homes. They gradually repay the Welsh Government, which then finds its share of UK government spending correspondingly adjusted. 'The money' So perhaps they're both right: it's added spending power, but from Cardiff's point of view the wrong kind of money. But is it just about the money? Professor Drakeford, who also has to decide whether to follow Philip Hammond and adopt Ed Miliband's stamp duty policy, published several tweets highlighting higher public spending in Wales. ""Continuing to protect spending on education in Wales,"" he said. ""It's 3% higher than in England."" On the NHS: ""Spending on health and social care 8% higher in Wales than in England."" And on homes: ""We're already prioritising funding for housing: Â£1.4 billion to build 20,000 new homes. The Chancellor is following where @welshgovernment leads."" That may sound very re-assuring if you live in Wales. But it also raises questions about the outcomes delivered by that higher spending.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Lowering tuition fees 'implausible', say vice-chancellors","The party is yet to unveil its policy but Ed Miliband has said he wants to reduce the cap from Â£9,000 to Â£6,000. In a letter to the Times from Universities UK, vice-chancellors in England said this would create a Â£10bn hole in revenues over five years. Shadow universities minister Liam Byrne said ""the student finance system is going bust"" under the current system. 'Barrier to growth' The vice-chancellors warned that if a Labour government reduced the fees cap, that would lead to ""cuts to universities that would damage the economy, affect the quality of students' education, and set back work on widening access to higher education"". In the letter by Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, and signed by English members of the Universities UK board, it is argued that the move ""risks the equality of education for all"". It reads: ""Any move to limit the number of students attending universities as a way of reducing costs would remove opportunities for young people and those seeking to return to education, and act as a barrier to economic growth."" They argue that students, especially those from poor backgrounds, would be better helped with greater financial support for living costs from the government - especially as loan repayments only start once a student is earning Â£21,000 a year. Sir Christopher later added that Labour had ""missed the point"", saying: ""This is purely a pragmatic issue, that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal."" Delay decision? BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Universities UK was concerned that lowering fees would leave them more dependent on government funding - and vulnerable to spending cuts. He said: ""But they also question how a Labour government would be able to find the necessary Â£10 billion over the next parliament to pay for such a cut in fees. ""A task which Ed Miliband has asked the shadow chancellor Ed Balls to resolve - so far without success."" He added: ""The intervention of the universities can only add to Labour's difficulties over tuition fees - with some predicting the party could opt to delay any final decision by opting for a review into the future of university funding after the election."" Shadow universities minister Liam Byrne said: ""The Tory-led government trebled fees and now it is crystal clear that the student finance system is going bust, saddling students with debts most will never repay of Â£43,500 on average and costing the taxpayer more than the system it replaced. ""According to new Ucas analysis, trebled fees have deterred thousands of potential students from applying."" He did not confirm the new policy however, saying Labour's plans would be announced ""in due course ahead of the general election"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
East London Thames crossings plan to exceed Â£43m,"Figures disclosed by the Mayor of London show the total spent on the project will reach Â£43.4m by next year. Assembly Member Darren Johnson, of the Green Party, said that despite the public expense, ""not a single bit of construction work has been done"". Transport for London (TfL) said new river crossings are ""crucial"". The figures came to light following a question to the mayor by Darren Johnson. The Thames Gateway Bridge team was set up while Ken Livingstone was mayor in 2003, to look at options for new transport links across the river in east and south-east London. The project has been closed and re-opened twice in the last 10 years. Current plans include a ferry at Gallions Reach linking Thamesmead and Beckton - due to open in 2017 at the earliest - and a road tunnel linking Silvertown to the Greenwich Peninsula - which could open by 2021. Their purpose is to ease the congestion in the Blackwall Tunnel, Woolwich Ferry and other transport links over the river. 'No public support' Mayor Boris Johnson said approximately Â£6m of the project's funds will be used to support ""further and more detailed traffic modelling and engineering, environmental assessments and surveys and statutory public consultations"". Darren Johnson said a ""truly staggering amount of public money"" was being used for links which the public ""do not support"". He said the funds would have been better spent on ""reducing traffic and making our existing roads safer and that more money should be allocated for ""schemes for pedestrians and cyclists"". ""The amount of car driver trips taken in London has been in decline for over 12 years, despite a rising population,"" he added. He called on the mayor, who is the chairman of the TfL board, to ""stop lobbying for road links which will result in even more polluted air, more congestion and a dirtier, more unpleasant city for Londoners"". But TfL's managing director of planning, Michele Dix, said: ""The spending referred to by the Green Party covers all work carried out in relation to river crossings in east and south east London from 2000 to 2014 and includes a substantial amount of work on the Thames Gateway Bridge. ""There is a crucial need for additional river crossings in east London."" Currently, the only crossings for cars and lorries between Rotherhithe and Dartford are the Blackwall Tunnel and Woolwich Ferry.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Peter Robinson will not attend 'circus act' opening of NI talks,"The inter-party talks, convened by the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, are due to begin next Thursday. Mr Robinson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, called the planned opening of the talks ""a showpiece"" and ""a circus act for the media"". However, he said when the ""real work"" began the DUP would be there. 'High wire act' Mr Robinson told the BBC he was not aware that the talks were due to begin next Thursday and added he found out about the date through the media. ""The secretary of state hasn't spoken to me about the date of the beginning of any talks. I know that I have a very full diary as first minister next Thursday,"" the DUP leader said. ""Of course, the indication is that next Thursday is a sort of showpiece - the circus act for the sake of media - it's not getting down to the nitty gritty. ""I'm very keen to roll up my sleeves and get down, we want the process to work. We think it's essential that we look at the arrangements for government at Stormont. We think it's absolutely essential that we look at budget issues and welfare reform issues. ""So when the real work begins, the Democratic Unionist Party is there to talk about those issues, but we really don't favour the high wire act and the circus of bringing people together, just for the sake of the cameras."" Fresh talks Mr Robinson said he did not want to be involved in a media exercise that he claimed was about ""building up expectation, when really what's required is for us all to get down to work"". The secretary of state announced a fresh round of inter-party talks last month, just days after Mr Robinson had described the structures of devolved government in Northern Ireland as ""no longer fit for purpose"". Writing in the Belfast Telegraph on 9 September, Mr Robinson said the weight of the issues to be resolved at Stormont was so great that it ""must be tackled in a St Andrews 2 setting, with government involvement"". The 2006 St Andrews Agreement paved the way for the return of devolution the following year. Sinn FÃ©in, the second largest party in Northern Ireland's power-sharing coalition, had also called for fresh talks, and urged the British, Irish and US governments to get involved.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
L'Origine du Monde: Mystery Courbet nude uncovered 150 years on,"Now a French scholar may have solved the mystery of whose body was painted so explicitly in his 1866 work, not exhibited publicly in France till 1991. The subject of Courbet's work was for years assumed to be his Irish lover. But the woman now thought to be in the picture is dancer Constance Queniaux. Warning: graphic content in Courbet painting below French literary expert Claude Schopp stumbled on his discovery as he went through correspondence between two writers, George Sand and the son of Alexandre Dumas. Who was Constance Queniaux? Queniaux had retired as a ballet dancer at the Paris Opera in 1859 and aged 34 she was a mistress of Turkish-Egyptian diplomat Halil Sherif Pasha. In later years she became a woman of some means, given to philanthropic work. She is seen clothed in the top left and bottom left images of the picture below. The diplomat who commissioned L'Origine du Monde, who was known as Khalil Bey, kept Courbet's painting in his dressing room behind a green curtain, revealing the work to visitors and dinner party guests. The former dancer is mentioned in one letter from Dumas. Not only is her name badly spelt but a word was wrongly transcribed in the following line: ""One does not paint the most delicate and the most sonorous interview of Miss Queniault of the Opera."" Schopp was puzzled by the word interview, so he consulted the original manuscript in the National Library of France dating back to June 1871 and found the error. Dumas had written of Ms Queniaux's delicate and sonorous ""interior"" rather than interview, leading Schopp to deduce that Dumas was writing about the painting. And that was not all. Having shared his discovery with Sylvie Aubenas at the library, she was convinced he was right. When Ms Queniaux died in 1908 she bequeathed a painting by Courbet of a bouquet of spring flowers and red and white camellias. Camellias were the flowers most closely identified with courtesans, and Aubenas told AFP news agency she believed the painting was a gift from Courbet and his Ottoman patron. The Courbet painting is still considered so risquÃ© that Facebook shut down a French teacher's account when he posted a picture of it. Who else could Courbet have painted? Khalil Bey also had liaisons with courtesan Marie-Anne Detourbay, and some have previously suggested she was the woman in the painting. Many argued the woman was Courbet's own lover, Irish model Joanna Hiffernan, although her hair colour was red rather than the black seen in L'Origine du Monde. Hiffernan was also romantically linked to painter James Whistler. In 2013, French art expert Jean-Jacques Fernier said he believed that an unsigned painting of a woman's head had been cut off the Courbet work. But there was no recorded evidence that Courbet's work had ever been cut in two.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Kinlochleven couple in bid to sue TripAdvisor reviewers,"Martin and Jacqui Clark, who run the business in Kinlochleven, maintain that one report was false and that another set out events that were fictional. TripAdvisor has challenged the move over its competency, claiming that there is no jurisdiction. The judge has reserved his decision in the case and will give a ruling later. The Clarks have asked the Court of Session in Edinburgh to make an order for TripAdvisor to disclose the names, addresses and other information they have on the identity of the authors. 'Were abusive' In their petition, the couple said: ""The postings purported to review events that did not take place. They were not reviews submitted by actual travellers."" It is alleged that the reviews were submitted contrary to the rules of TripAdvisor and that the postings were not made contemporaneously. Both writers claimed to have visited the premises in September 2011, but the reviews did not appear until February and March the following year. It is alleged that the postings were made maliciously and that ""the reviews published were abuse or invective in the form of criticism"". Graeme Henderson, counsel for the Clarks, said they were applying to seek such assistance as they could from TripAdvisor over the identity of the two individuals named in the reviews as edna B and dreckit. He told the court: ""This is a proposed action in respect of which the pursuers take exception to two postings on the website. My position is they were plainly defamatory."" 'Unknown posters' Mr Henderson said the couple, who operate a guest house, Tigh-Na-Cheo, said they could claim damages as individuals and for loss of business. He told judge Paul Arthurson QC: ""Living in the real world there is a substantial claim for defamation. ""Proceedings are more likely to be brought against the two writers than anyone else. ""TripAdvisor effectively is the holder of information in a dispute of other parties. That is really TripAdvisor's role in the dispute between the petitioners and the unknown posters."" Mr Henderson went on: ""We are not, as petitioners, pursuing TripAdvisor. All we are simply doing is seeking a court order for information."" Paul O'Brien, counsel for the travel website, said there were pleadings set out that TripAdvisor had a place of business in England, but its position was that its place of business was in Massachusetts, in the US. He said: ""I am told TripAdvisor maintains its computer systems in the US."" Mr O'Brien said that even to recover information from other parts of the UK the court would issue a request to a court in that part of the country. He argued that the legislation under which the order was sought was not available in the circumstances against TripAdvisor. The counsel also maintained that the guest house proprietors entered an agreement that claims of this kind would be brought in Massachusetts.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Cost of dying 'rose more than 10% last year',"The average cost of services including probate, headstones, flowers and the burial or cremation fee is now Â£8,427, according to insurer SunLife. The average cost of a funeral has increased by 87% since the survey was first conducted in 2004. SunLife described a 39% jump in estate administration fees as a ""significant"" factor in this year's increase. The figures are set out in SunLife Direct's annual Cost of Dying report, which said that hiring a professional such as a solicitor now accounts for more than a third of expenditure associated with a person's death. The report found that saving money was a key motivation for the increased number of people who choose to manage their loved ones' affairs without professional help. 'Complex process' Responding to the survey's findings, a Law Society spokesperson said that enlisting a solicitor ""may save time and money in the future by ensuring things are done right the first time"". Another factor influencing how much people spent was the type of funeral, since cremation tends to be less expensive than burial. The average burial cost is now Â£3,982, a rise of 2% since last year and 89% since the survey began in 2004. Dr Kate Woodthorpe, a sociologist from the University of Bath and author of the SunLife report, said the costs of funerals were rising ""on numerous fronts"". Funeral directors' fees reflect the costs of ""staff salaries, the expense of running a business, but also the costs recovered by local authorities"", she explained. ""Local authorities are trying to preserve land by removing subsidies for burial, and in the case of cremation trying to recover the costs of meeting mercury emissions targets,"" she said. 'Funding slashed' A spokesman for the Local Government Association responded that local government funding had been ""slashed"" over the past three years which meant ""councils have been forced to examine all their services carefully"". ""Where services have been subsidised by council tax payers previously, as has been the case with some cemeteries and crematoriums, councils have had no choice but to review the fees they charge,"" the spokesman said. Cost also varied widely across different regions. The average funeral cost in the London area was Â£10,498, compared with Â£5,893 in Northern Ireland. The cost of a funeral will not always be met by families. When a person dies without relatives or the relatives are unable to pay, local councils or the NHS can provide a public health funeral. Dr Woodthorpe argued that ""we don't have a culture of talking about death, which means we often don't plan properly, and we need to address that"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting?","Who, What, WhyThe Magazine answers the questions behind the news Bullfighting is a ""supremely dangerous art"", says Garry Marvin, professor of human-animal studies at Roehampton University. ""If a normal person got into the ring with a fighting bull, I'd expect them to be severely gored or dead in a few moments."" Matadors are highly skilled, however, and may go several seasons without injury. What do the figures say? Bullfighting in Spain is run by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport - but surprisingly no statistics on injuries are kept. Some unofficial figures do exist, however. In the 2013 season, 31 matadors received horn wounds, according to the datoros.com website. Some were minor, some life-threatening. As well as the matadors themselves, 16 of their assistants were injured - the assistants usually include ""picadors"" on horseback, ""banderilleros"" on foot, and a sword page. These 47 injuries occurred during a total of 661 bullfights in Spain in 2013 (the ministry does count how many bullfights take place). The profession is less perilous than it was, thanks to advances in medicine. The invention of penicillin helped, and today at big bullrings specialist surgeons are on standby to operate. The last Spanish matador to die was Jose Cubero Sanchez ""El Yiyo"" in 1985. Alexander Fiske-Harrison, author of Into The Arena: The World of the Spanish Bullfight, cites records showing that 533 professional bullfighters have been killed in Spain since 1700. However the records may be incomplete, he says, as bullfighting has only been regulated for 100 years. When matadors are hurt, the injuries can be gruesome. In October 2011, Juan Jose Padilla was blinded in one eye by a horn. He was back six months later. Worldwide, the last matador to die was Colombian Jose Eslava Caceres, who was trapped against boards at the edge of the ring in 1987, and suffered a fatal piercing of the lung. While the matador is there by choice, the bull is not. It dies every time, apart from rare occasions where both bull and matador perform exceptionally well. In these cases, the bull's life is spared.

Swansea copper heritage boat Black Prince's maiden voyage,"The Black Prince takes passengers from Swansea marina to the Liberty Stadium and back on Sunday. Charles White, chair of Swansea Community Boat Trust, said he was delighted it had been given the green light a year after buying the vessel. The tour will pass the site of the Hafod copperworks, which was promised a Â£540,000 heritage grant on Friday. Time travel The charitable trust raised funds including corporate sponsorship and grants to buy the Black Prince from a company which ran canal cruises in Leeds. Up to Â£180,000 has been spent on the project so far, including Â£80,000 for the boat. It will take school pupils, community groups and tourists from Swansea marina to the Morfa Basqule Bridge and back in a two-hour round trip. Tours are open for all passengers from 11:00 - 13:00 GMT every Saturday and Sunday. The two-mile stretch of the River Tawe passes through the remains of ""Copperopolis,"" where 90% of the world's copper in the 19th Century was processed. The charity promises a ""time travel"" experience for passengers, with plans to install computers showing animated recreations of the historic landscapes on the route. Mr White said: ""I'm delighted to be able to report that both the boat itself and the safety procedures that we have in place have been given the green light by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). ""The last few months have been a busy time for the Trust with the appointment of boat manager Wayne Morgan and boatmaster Chrissie Joyce. ""The pair have put in an incredible amount of work since their appointment. ""The MCA have awarded both with extensions to their boatmaster licences that now permit them to carry up to fifty passengers along the River Tawe."" Support for the project has come from the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, the European Development Fund through the Welsh Government, the Environment Agency, and Swansea council. On Friday, the Welsh government announced a grant of some Â£540,000 to open the Hafod copperworks site to the public. The money from Welsh heritage body Cadw will be used to restore some of its features and create tourist trails. Swansea council said it still hoped to attract commercial development to parts of the site despite a disappointing response since it was put on the market last year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
HMV saved: Music fans and employees give their verdict,"By Steve HoldenNewsbeat reporter in Manchester The company has been in administration since the beginning of 2013 after problems in the face of online competition. Hilco has acquired 132 HMV shops, in a deal that could secure 2,500 jobs. HMV's central Manchester store, the third largest in the country, had been earmarked for closure but will now stay open. The employee: Jane Carter, 29 ""I worked at HMV full time for six-and-a-half years and it's been a crazy three months. ""When I thought our store was closing I went and got another job. However, I know a lot of the other staff feel relieved. You have a loyalty to a brand like HMV. I always wanted to work there. ""If Hilco managed to turn around the fortunes of HMV Canada, I hope they adjust the British HMV to what the public want. ""For the moment, I'm thrilled for the company. It would be amazing for it to make it to its 100th anniversary. ""HMV missed too many opportunities in the past and made too many wrong decisions. That's me talking as an employee who knows what the customers ask for and request. ""Can they pull it back now? I really don't know but I'd like them to."" The musician: Marcus Akil, 18, busker ""It was actually really upsetting when I thought it was closing. It's been there for as long as I can remember. ""It's great that it's staying open and that I can still buy my CDs and films there. Yes, its problems have come with the fact that everyone's buying online, but it's less personal. ""I would love my CD to be in HMV - that defines success. Without HMV there's no target because anyone can have their song on iTunes. "" The customer: Dan Moik, 24, bartender ""I guess it's a good thing to see places turn around. I was a bit upset when they were going to close down. ""I buy my CDs and DVDs physically and digitally and when you find that CD you've been looking for, you have to have it. It's always good to have a physical copy. ""Market Street is the main street in Manchester. If it had closed down it would have left a big dent and I'm not sure what would have filled it. ""HMV definitely needs to jump on the digital wagon, maybe a link with iTunes or Spotify. A streaming service could work if they offered a good enough rate. Let's see where they go.

TVR sports car firm stake bought by Welsh Government,"By Nick ServiniPolitical editor, Wales It has also provided a Â£2m loan to the company ahead of production getting underway in Ebbw Vale. TVR said there is another year of research to be completed before manufacturing is due to begin in 2019. The Tories called for assurances that public money is being safeguarded. The Welsh Government said it will ensure taxpayers benefit from future success. The site where TVR plans to produce its new cars was acquired by the Welsh Government last year. The 200,000 sq ft former Techboard building is part of plans to invest Â£100m by ministers in an automotive business park in Ebbw Vale. The TVR brand was bought by new owners in 2013 after the company had stopped production more than a decade ago in Blackpool. The firm now plans to create 150 jobs in Ebbw Vale. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""TVR are making good progress with their new car and have secured all necessary funding to complete the pre-production design and engineering development work. ""As part of our initial support package to commit TVR to manufacturing in Wales and following independent and specialist due diligence, we provided a repayable commercial loan to the company in early 2016. This was made alongside a private sector lender. ""At the same time Welsh Government also invested Â£500k into equity on the same terms as other investors. ""This gives the Welsh Government a minority stake of just below 3% that will ensure the Welsh tax payer benefits from the company's successes."" 'Tangible evidence' The Welsh Conservatives called for assurances from ministers that taxpayer money is being properly safeguarded. Economy spokesman Russell George said: ""We need to see tangible evidence that this investment represents value for money. ""The prestige of the TVR badge is one thing - and there is understandable excitement around their decision to locate in Wales. ""However, we need to see the jobs that were promised, and as major shareholders in the company the Welsh public will want to see genuine progress. ""Millions of pounds have been invested in TVR, and the Welsh Government must ensure that this exciting project doesn't turn into another disappointment for the people of Blaenau Gwent.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
A-level exam 'leak': Belfast grammar pupils sanctioned,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent Nine students at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution (RBAI) and Methodist College (MCB) are affected, the BBC understands. The investigation concerned the CCEA A2 business studies paper that candidates sat on the afternoon of Monday 12 June. It is believed that some details from the exam were shared on social media. The BBC understands two pupils will not receive their A-level grade as a result, but can re-sit the exam in the next school year. 'Examination malpractice' However, the BBC also understands that most of the students involved received a warning - the lowest level of sanction - and will still receive their A-level result next week. It is unclear how the alleged malpractice came to light. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) - Northern Ireland's exam-setting and qualifications body - subsequently investigated the allegations. The schools and pupils involved were informed of the outcome of the investigation this week. In a statement, a CCEA spokesperson confirmed: ""Following an allegation of examination malpractice at two Belfast schools, a full investigation has been carried out regarding the GCE Business Studies examination sat on 12 June."" ""From the findings of the investigation, the CCEA malpractice committee has applied a range of penalties to candidates at both centres."" ""CCEA will not make any further comment in regards to the investigation or outcome of the investigation, in order to protect the identity of the young people involved."" ""For any suspected cases of malpractice, we thoroughly investigate the incident to ensure that no individual sitting a CCEA examination has an unfair advantage. The number of malpractice cases ""remain small in number"", it added. ""Our advice to any student who comes across any suspicious examination content is to report it immediately to their teacher, principal or CCEA."" MCB said it had fully cooperated with the CCEA investigation, which came after it had passed information to the board following its own formal investigation. ""This is a deeply regrettable incident for all those involved,"" said a spokesperson for the school. ""All pupils at Methody are given clear guidance on how to conduct themselves during external examinations, including the requirement to report immediately to a member of staff, the principal or CCEA any incidence of the leaking of information about the content of an exam."" The BBC contacted RBAI, which said it had fully co-operated with CCEA on the matter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Will Brexit last longer than other winning words of the year?,"The word had its first recorded use in 2013 but as the EU referendum approached, more and more people started using it. It's an increase that Collins says is ""unheard of"" since it began monitoring word usage. It's a word that will definitely be sticking around for a while but are we still using previous winning words? Binge-watch, 2015 Last year's word of the year reflected our obsession with box sets. Meaning ""to watch a large number of television programmes (especially all the shows from one series) in succession"", it reflected a change in viewing habits due to subscription services like Netflix. There's no sign of it slowing down either with the video streaming company adding 3.2 million international customers in the last three months. Photobomb, 2014 This dog photbombed the Pope in 2016 Back in 2014 photobombing was all the rage - even the Queen got involved. The Queen photobombed hockey player Jayde's photo. It beat off competition from bakeoff and normcore. The photobomb is officially defined by the Collins English Dictionary as ""to intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge"". A bit like this butterfly - although the koala clearly knows what's going on. This tweet shows the footage of a butterfly photobombing a koala. Twerking, 2013 Who can forget THAT performance by Miley Cyrus at the MTV Music Video Awards in 2013? It not only got her some new found fame (not that she needed it) but also pushed twerk into the top spot. Both Collins and Oxford dictionaries named it word of the year. The word, borrowed from hip-hop culture, was first used in 1820, spelt twirk, to refer to a twisting or jerking movement or twitch. Since then, it's sadly been adopted by embarrassing dads at weddings. Omnishambles, 2012 If you're thinking this sounds like an entirely made-up word, you're right. It had never been heard until it was put to brilliant use in the political satire The Thick of It. You can sort of work out what it means but officially, it's described as a situation that has been ""comprehensively mismanaged, and is characterised by a string of blunders and miscalculations"". It went down so well that it was even used in the House of Commons, when the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, used the word to describe the government's budget. But it doesn't seem to get many outings these days. And here's one still going seven years on.... Unfriend, 2009 Don't pretend you've never done it.

Garden eels 'forgetting about humans' need people to video-chat,"Keepers at Toyko's Sumida Aquarium, which has been closed since 1 March due to the coronavirus pandemic, are starting to worry about their garden eels. The sensitive little creatures had become used to seeing hundreds of faces peering into their tanks. Now the aquarium is deserted they've started to dive into the sand whenever their keepers walk past. This makes it hard to check they're healthy. The aquarium says the eels are ""forgetting about humans"" and is making what it calls an ""emergency plea"". ""Could you show your face to our garden eels from your home?"" Yes, they're asking people to call in for a sub-aqua video chat and remind the eels that humans are friendly. ""Creatures in the aquarium don't see humans except keepers and they have started forgetting about humans,"" the aquarium wrote on Twitter. ""Garden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by."" The eels are particularly sensitive - and the aquarium is keen to reacquaint the 300 eels it homes with humans so they can carry out important health checks on them. It's placing five tablets facing towards the tank in a ""face-showing festival"" scheduled for 3 to 5 May. Unfortunately, if you love eels but also love Google phones or PCs, you'll have to sit this one out - the aquarium is only offering the option to connect with the eels over Apple's FaceTime app. Garden eel facts Garden eels live in sandy burrows that they dig tail-first and coat with mucus to stop the burrow collapsing. They're some of the sea's little builders. When it comes round to mating season the males and females move their burrows closer to each other. They live in colonies of several hundred and each eel has its own burrow - with the largest male usually living in the centre burrow, according to the Georgia Aquarium. When we see them it's usually only a quarter of their body that is poked up out of the sand - the rest stays in their burrow. They rarely leave, even to mate. You could say they're the original self-isolaters. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Coronavirus: Bat scientists find new evidence,"By Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand. And they predict that similar coronaviruses may be present in bats across many Asian nations and regions. The discovery extends the area in which related viruses have been found to a distance of 4,800km (2,983 miles). And it gives clues to how Covid-19 might have emerged. The researchers said sampling was limited, but they were confident that coronaviruses ""with a high degree of genetic relatedness to Sars-CoV-2 are widely present in bats across many nations and regions in Asia"". The area includes Japan, China and Thailand, the researchers said in a report published in Nature Communications. Past studies have suggested that Sars-CoV-2 emerged in an animal, most likely a bat, before spreading to humans. The precise origins of the virus are unknown and have been investigated by a team commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the latest research, a team lead by Lin-Fa Wang of Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore detected a close relative of Sars-CoV-2 in horseshoe bats kept in an artificial cave at a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand. The virus, named RacCS203, is a close match to the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 (with 91.5% similarity in their genomes). It is also closely related to another coronavirus - called RmYN02 - which is found in bats in Yunnan, China (with 93.6% similarity to the genome of Sars-CoV-2). ""We need to do more surveillance in animals,"" said Prof Wang. ""In order to find the true origin, the surveillance work needs to go beyond the border of China."" One big concern is the ability of coronaviruses to move between different mammals, for example cats, dogs and minks. By moving between species, the virus can mutate and evolve into a new pathogen, which could explain how Covid-19 emerged. Dr Thiravat Hemachudha of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, was part of the team of international researchers. The viruses found in bats in Thailand and China act as ""a perfect template that can recombine with others and eventually evolve as new emerging pathogen(s), Covid-19 virus as one"", he said. The researchers also examined antibodies in bats and a trafficked pangolin seized in southern Thailand. The antibodies were able to neutralise the pandemic virus, which is further evidence that Sars-CoV-2-related coronaviruses are circulating in Southeast Asia, they said. Commenting, Prof Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings highlighted the broad distribution of bats and viruses that may include the originator of the current outbreak. ""Further work is required to understand how Sars-CoV-2 passed from animals to humans, with the recent WHO investigators in Wuhan showing that as of yet, these is no conclusive evidence of how this happened,"" he said.

Saudi Arabia hosts its first ever women's cycle race,"By Paul HarrisonBBC UGC and Social News Saudi women cyclists were able to compete in a race held in the city of Jeddah on Tuesday. Forty-seven women competed in the 10-kilometre race, which was organised by Be Active, a group bringing together women cyclists and local authorities. You may also like: In a statement to local media, race organiser Nadima Abu al-Enein said she was surprised by the number of cyclists in attendance. ""The large participant turnout prompted the organizing committee to increase the allowed number of participants from 30 to 47 girls,"" she said. ""However, the committee was still forced to exclude numerous others who hoped to participate."" Although the event received positive reactions from some on Twitter, it proved to be controversial for others. A Twitter user commented: ""I am not a religious cleric but a woman can be seductive and getting on a bicycle reveals all her attractive parts to men. If she wants to ride a bike she must do that by herself and not in public nor in front of people."" Another user said women sports are needed, ""but within limits and not in front of men"". Many Twitter users praised the cyclists and organisers. @p9p___ said the event ""looks like so much fun."" @foof_foofa praised the city for staging the race. ""We don't care about your objections,"" she tweeted. @N9n9Ta replied to critics of the race: ""In five years or 10 or 20, the women who are criticizing the event on social media are going to take part in similar races or will attend them and cheer on those racing. Just like they did with mobile phones, televisions, schools, nursing, medicine... They'll look back and be embarrassed by the way they reacted."" Ms Abu al-Enein set up her bicycle club in 2017, using social media to recruit fellow Saudi female cycling enthusiasts and raise the awareness around cycling for both Saudi women and the wider population. In an interview with Cycling Today, she described the difficulties she and her fellow riders faced when riding in the country, but said the number of women cyclists grow all the time. In 2013 the authorities in Saudi Arabia decreed women are allowed to ride bicycles in recreational areas on condition they dress modestly and are accompanied by a male guardian at all times.

Cholera death toll rises in hurricane-hit Haiti,"Fifty-nine people had died up until and including Thursday, and 617 others had been infected, bringing the total affected to 7,359, the ministry added. The news came as the local authorities and relief agencies attempted to get clean drinking water to those areas worse affected by Hurricane Tomas. The storm caused flooding and left eight people dead in western Haiti. The charity, Save the Children, said that in Leogane, the streets had been turned into ""rivers"" and some 35,000 people had been affected. The BBC's Laura Trevelyan in the town said the water reached her knees, and that people were afraid of the risk of disease. There was also flooding in Les Cayes, Jacmel and Gonaives, while many mountain towns have been cut off by flooded roads and landslides. 'Additional risk' There was widespread relief on Friday after Hurricane Tomas passed without destroying the tented camps in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, housing about 1.3 million survivors of January's earthquake. However, attention soon turned to preventing the spread of cholera, which is caused by bacteria transmitted through contaminated water or food, in the unsanitary conditions. Cholera causes diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to severe dehydration, but can kill quickly. It is treated easily through rehydration and antibiotics. A spokesman for the Pan-American Health Organisation, Christian Lindmeier, told the Reuters news agency: ""Cholera is a water-borne disease and so additional water means additional risk."" ""We do expect the infection rate to jump up due to the flooding and to the bad sanitation conditions in many areas,"" he said. In the town of Saint Marc, in the northern region where the outbreak began three weeks ago, a Cuban doctor in charge of the local hospital said there had been more cases of cholera since the hurricane. ""The situation here - after the storm - has worsened,"" Dr Buenaventura Sanchez told the Associated Press. ""We are seeing higher numbers [of cases] than in the days before, and we are also seeing cases of cholera with typhoid fever at the same time."" Like cholera, typhoid is caught by consuming contaminated food or drink that has been handled by an infected person, or if contaminated sewage gets into water used for drinking or washing food. It can also be fatal if not treated. Gary Shaye, the country director of Save the Children, said thousands of children in Leogane were now at increased risk of diarrhoeal diseases. On Friday, Haiti's government and the United Nations appealed to donors for nearly $19m to cover urgent humanitarian needs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Rail disruption caused by bad planning, Network Rail says","Thousands of passengers had their journeys disrupted when work near King's Cross took longer than planned. Trains were switched to Finsbury Park, a much smaller station. ""Not enough was done"" in planning the switch, said the report, which included an apology from Mark Carne, Network Rail's chief executive. Work near London's Paddington station finished on time, but a safety check took eight hours longer than planned. 'We let passengers down' ""A number of things went wrong in these two instances. In addition it is clear that our project back-up plans and the train service plans should have done a much better job in protecting the travelling public from our engineering problems,"" Mr Carne said. ""Over Christmas, we undertook the biggest programme of engineering and investment work ever, on train lines across the country. Ninety-nine per cent went to plan but in the case of King's Cross and Paddington we let passengers down. ""I sincerely apologise for the disruption over the festive period and we are determined to learn the lessons so that we can continue to make the improvements the travelling public deserve."" Analysis: Richard Westcott, Transport correspondent Is anyone getting a sense of deja vu here? Seven years ago. Christmas holidays. Overrunning repair work. Thousands stranded at train stations. Back then, Network Rail was forced to admit that specialist workmen simply hadn't turned up for work. The company was fined Â£14m (a record at the time) by the regulator and promised it would never happen again. Clearly it has, although for totally different reasons this time. The regulator may choose to fine the company again, but many question the point of big fines. It means taking money that could be used to repair the network, and giving it to the government instead. It's hard to see how that helps passengers. Work should have been finished allowing King's Cross and Paddington to open on 27 December. But King's Cross had to close all day while Paddington only opened in the early afternoon. Network Rail said that, by 10:30 on 27 December, Finsbury Park had become so crowded that incoming passengers could not get off their trains. Rail travellers had to queue for as much as three hours to get into the station. Better information The row over the delays led to Mr Carne renouncing his annual bonus, which could have been as much as Â£135,000. ""On the basis of this report and the events on the day the industry has a long way to go to restore trust in how it handles these events,"" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of the rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus. Network Rail says it will review how it plans for over-runs and will ""provide better information to passengers"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Catalonia Spain: Separatists set to boost majority in regional parliament,"With more than 99% of votes counted, the three parties are on course to get 74 seats in the 135-strong assembly, up from 70 in the outgoing parliament. That would allow them to govern, despite splits on major issues. Meanwhile, the unionist Socialist Party also looks likely to win a large share of the vote. Turnout in Sunday's election was just over 53%, the lowest in modern times. The backdrop of this election was far removed from the last one, just over three years ago, says BBC World Service Europe regional editor Danny Aeberhard. Then, it was the fervour of a rancorous dispute with Madrid over independence, he says. Now, it has been the coronavirus pandemic - with polling station staff decked out in full protective gear at the end of the day to enable those who had tested positive for the virus to vote. But politically, the result seems to be similar. 'The time has come to negotiate' The Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) is now on course to secure 33 seats, making its leader Pere AragonÃ¨s frontrunner to become Catalonia's next leader. ""Sit and talk. I would like to send a message to European authorities, the results are clear,"" Mr AragonÃ¨s was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""We, the pro-independence parties have a majority, we have reached more than 50% of the popular vote. The Catalan people have spoken, the time has come to negotiate a referendum of self-determination. Please get involved."" Mr AragonÃ¨s has been acting as regional leader since Quim Torra was disqualified last September for refusing to take down a pro-independence symbol from a government building. With more than 99% of ballots counted, the majority of seats in the 135-seat parliament will be shared between: Catalonia, home to the city of Barcelona, is an affluent region in north-eastern Spain with about 7.5 million people. Its drive for independence plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in 40 years in 2017. The region had its autonomy suspended for almost seven months by the central government in Madrid after a failed bid to break away. In 2019, Spain's Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan politicians and activists to jail terms of between nine and 13 years for that independence bid.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping,"In a legal notice Clean Air in London asked the mayor to ""delay implementing his decision until he can ensure air pollution is not worsened"". Mr Johnson has promised to get rid of the west London extension on 24 December. His office said losing the zone will have ""minimal impact"" on air quality. Drivers are charged Â£8-a-day when they enter central London and the western extension zone (WEZ), which was introduced in 2007. The mayor's spokeswoman said the group's ""letter before action"" was received on 3 December, but it would not affect the implementation of Mr Johnson's decision announced in October. The letter asks the mayor to ""ensure air pollution is not worsened, or, delay implementing his decision until he can ensure air pollution is not worsened, or, reverse his decision"". 'Populist' decision Simon Birkett, founder of Clean Air in London, said: ""The mayor's own consultation documents estimate that emissions of PM10 would increase by 3-4% on average across the WEZ area if the scheme is removed, compared with an estimate in his draft Air Quality Strategy of a 13% average reduction between 2008 and 2011 for London as a whole. ""Ambient air concentrations are much harder to reduce than emissions. ""The Mayor has chosen a seemingly populist route despite Transport for London's analysis of the traffic, environmental, revenue, economic and social impacts showing overwhelmingly negative results. ""Any legal action must always be a last resort. This is about defending and improving air quality, not defending road tax."" Mr Johnson's spokeswoman said: ""The mayor was elected on a pledge to provide Londoners with a consultation on the future of the western extension zone and Londoners have repeatedly shown him they are firmly in favour of its abolition. ""The impact of removing the zone on air quality is predicted to be minimal and the mayor is pursuing measures that are more targeted at improving air quality and reducing pollution. ""In line with his promise and in accordance with the wishes of Londoners he intends to abolish the WEZ on Christmas Eve."" The group also sent a letter to Caroline Spelman, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, over the issue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kim Kardashian: Studying law not about privilege or money,"Kim revealed she's studying to become a lawyer last week, and will be taking her bar exam in 2022.

Kim shared a photo on Instagram of her working alongside her two lawyer mentors - Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney. ""I've seen some comments from people who are saying it's my privilege or my money that got me here, but that's not the case,"" she wrote. ""One person actually said I should 'stay in my lane.' I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am.""

Once the apprenticeship is complete, she'll be following in the footsteps of her late father Robert Kardashian - who was a member of OJ Simpson's defence team during his murder trial. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star also addressed the confusion over her being able to study to be a lawyer if she didn't complete college. She confirmed that ""it's true"" that she didn't finish college and explained: ""You need 60 college credits (I had 75) to take part in 'reading the law', which is an in office law school being apprenticed by lawyers.""

Supreme Court divorce approval sought by 'unhappy wife',"Tini Owens, 68, from Broadway, Worcestershire, wants a court's refusal to grant her a divorce overruled. She says her marriage to Hugh Owens, 80, has broken down, but he claims they still have a ""few years"" to enjoy. Lawyers say she should not have to prove ""unreasonable"" behaviour by Mr Owens, but she should not ""reasonably be expected"" to stay with him. A ruling by the five justices is expected later this year and could have implications for unhappily married people seeking divorce. Barrister Philip Marshall QC, who leads Mrs Owens' legal team, told justices on Thursday that a ""modest shift"" of focus in interpretation of legislation was required. Mr Marshall said: ""The evidence... demonstrates powerfully that the effect on her of [Mr Owens'] behaviour - however culpable - is such that she should not reasonably be expected to return to a married relationship with him. ""It is submitted that the court can be satisfied... that [she] is entitled to a decree."" Mrs Owens had asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling that she could not divorce her husband of 40 years. But the appeal judges led by Sir James Munby upheld the original ruling. Should it be easier to get a divorce in England and Wales? The decision meant Mrs Owens had to remain married, although after five years of separation she would be eligible for a divorce even if her husband still objected. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Owens' case was that the marriage had broken down, although Mr Owens disagreed, saying that the couple still had a ""few years"" to enjoy. Mrs Owens contended she had been left in a ""wretched predicament"", locked in a ""loveless and desperately unhappy"" marriage. She had made 27 allegations about the way Mr Owens treated her, including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"" and said she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. Opposing a family court ruling made last year by Judge Robin Tolson, who refused to grant a divorce petition on the basis her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"", she took the case to the Court of Appeal. But on Friday, Sir James - the most senior family court judge in England and Wales - said: ""We cannot interfere with Judge Tolson's decision and refuse the wife the decree of divorce she sought."" He said Judge Tolson had correctly concluded that the marriage had not irretrievably broken down ""in law"". Nigel Dyer QC, who represents Mr Owen, said Mrs Owen is ""seeking to change the law and introduce divorce on unilateral demand"", and argued that if divorce law is to be changed, it is a matter for parliament, not the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court case, in London, continues.

Don Lock murder: Mother of accused pleaded for help for son,"Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed was ""the day that all your nightmares came true"". Mr Lock was attacked on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing last July. 'I killed someone' Earlier defence counsel David Howker QC said Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mr Daley's family for having ""failed"" him in his care and treatment. Mrs Daley told the court her son had many debts and the recent breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend had left him ""distraught"". ""We were never provided with a proper diagnosis. We were frequently in meetings but we were not listened to,"" she said. ""It's been continual over the last 10 years. In the past 10 years we have pleaded to people, it has been on a regular basis."" Mrs Daley told the court the apology from the NHS trust was ""10 years too late"". She said she feared her son was involved in the killing in Findon when she saw the news on television. When she failed to contact him she drove to the stables where he worked and saw his damaged car. The court heard the family decided to go to Worthing police station and as Mrs Daley was about enter, her son called her saying: ""I need to know where you are and that I can trust you."" Mr Daley also told her he had done ""something really bad or something really wrong. ""I killed someone."" 'Calm and expressionless' The court also heard Mr Daley police told a police officer ""when I drive, people try and break into my thoughts"". He also said: ""It's sad that I had to kill someone who was so aggressive to me when I wasn't aggressive at all."" Mr Lock was returning from a cycling meet when he was stabbed 39 times during a ""ferocious"" attack on the A24 at Findon in July. Witnesses have described Mr Daley as being ""expressionless"" during the attack, as though he was ""having a passport photo"" taken. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of Mr Daley's Ford Fusion and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Jurors have been told that Mr Daley's defence team will claim the defendant may have been acting in self defence because Mr Lock was angry and aggressive . Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey said Mr Lock died from a stab wound to the aorta. Stab wounds may have also also been inflicted when the 79-year-old lay dead or dying.

Fortnite pro Jarvis banned for using cheat software,"Jarvis Khattri was banned for using cheating software while playing the popular game. Fortnite creator Epic imposed the ban even though Mr Khattri used the software on a game account separate to the one he uses to compete and stream. Fans of Mr Khattri lobbied Epic via social media to get the ban lifted. Fortnite is a ""battle-royale"" type game which allows up to 100 players to fight individually or as part of a team to be the last standing on a virtual battlefield. Players gather materials to build structures which can prove crucial in the game's close-quarters firefights. 'Huge mistake' The type of ban imposed on Mr Khattri is believed to include key identifying details about the hardware he uses to play, and the net account through which he connects. This means it will be difficult for him to set up a new account and start playing again. In a statement, Epic said it had a ""zero-tolerance policy"" for anyone using cheat software. The software Mr Khattri used is known as an aimbot, which helps players land shots on opposing characters. ""When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly,"" Epic said. In a tweet, Mr Khattri said he took ""accountability"" for his actions. He added: ""I just wish I had known how severe the consequences were at the time and I would have never thought about doing it."" The UK-based player expressed similar remorse in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel on which he currently has about two million subscribers. He said: ""Obviously this is a huge mistake and it's completely wrong on my end."" Some of Mr Khattri's followers started using the #FreeJarvis hashtag to gain support for their call to have the ban lifted. Some pointed out that Epic had only imposed bans of two weeks on other pro players who were caught colluding during a recent tournament. The ban prompted a spat between popular gaming streamers Ninja and DrLupo during an online chat. Ninja, aka Tyler Blevins, who rose to fame through Fortnite, said Epic should be more lenient towards content creators who help the game thrive. DrLupo, aka Benjamin Lupo, had less sympathy, and said the ban was justified.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Elaine Doyle murder: DNA samples could give clues to death,"Detectives used sticky tape to recover fibres from the dead girl's skin and found traces of DNA from ""an unknown male"" on Elaine's back. Forensic experts believe that this may show that she was strangled from behind. John Docherty, 49, denies killing Elaine, 16, in Greenock in June of 1986. The teenager's naked body was found near her home in Ardgowan Street. The trial heard that some 20 years later, police used improved forensic tests which had not been available to look at evidence from the time of the murder. This showed traces of DNA from ""an unknown male"" on Elaine's skin. Tiny traces of DNA on her face probably came from the same man, forensic scientist Terence Randall, 65, told the trial. Advocate depute John Scullion, prosecuting, suggested that the naked girl was strangled from behind by a man who had previously been speaking to her. Mr Scullion suggested: ""Whilst naked, Elaine Doyle was strangled with a ligature by a male who was positioned behind her."" The forensic expert agreed that, if that were the case, he would expect to find the killer's DNA on the girl's back. Mr Scullion continued: ""If the perpetrator was exerting himself physically in order to strangle Elaine Doyle with a ligature could that result in a transfer of DNA?"" Mr Randall agreed that it could. DNA might come from sweat or breath. He also accepted that the DNA detected on the 16-year-old girl's face could be a sign that the man had been speaking to her. Blanket mystery Mr Randall also agreed that such a ""primary transfer"" was more likely than the DNA found on Elaine coming from a police blanket which may have covered her for a time. ""The quantity of DNA present would have to have taken a very large amount of DNA on clothing or blanket to make any of this possible,"" he said. The trial has heard there were signs of a struggle. Tufts of hair were found at the scene, a broken bracelet, and dirt on the front of the girl's body. But her clothes were undamaged and folded neatly beside her. Mr Docherty, now of Dunoon, denies murder and claims that at the time he is alleged to have strangled Elaine, he was with his parents - who are no longer alive - at their home. His defence team has lodged a special defence of incrimination, claiming the culprit might be among a list of 41 names taken from files of the police investigation into the murder. The trial continues. Related Internet Links Scottish Courts",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Joe Anderson: Liverpool mayor in police probe will not seek re-election,"Mr Anderson, 62, made the announcement after Merseyside Police said he had been rebailed until February following his arrest earlier this month. He tweeted he was ""disappointed"" with the police decision as he had ""provided all of the information they asked for"". He said it was in the Labour Party's best interests to pick a new candidate. Mr Anderson was arrested on 4 December, along with four other men, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. The year-long investigation, Operation Aloft, has focused on a number of building and development contracts in Liverpool. Following his arrest, Mr Anderson said he was ""stepping away from decision-making"" and would take unpaid leave while the police investigation continued. The Labour Party also suspended Mr Anderson pending its outcome. 'Lame duck mayor' Mr Anderson said he would ""continue to fight to demonstrate that I am innocent of any wrongdoing [and] also to protect my legacy as mayor of this city of which I am proud"". He said the timing of the police investigation meant ""it would be in the best interests of the Labour Party to select a new candidate for the mayoral election"". Mr Anderson also wrote: ""I have dedicated my life to this city with loyalty and passion and I am not prepared to throw that away."" Richard Kemp, leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Liverpool City Council, called on Mr Anderson to immediately resign from the local authority. Mr Kemp said his Labour opponent was a ""lame duck mayor"" who was ""preventing the city from moving on"". Mr Anderson said he hoped the police investigation would be completed ""long before"" the expiry of his term of office. He said it would confirm he had ""done nothing wrong"" and his name and reputation ""will be exonerated"". ""I have never done anything that would harm this city,"" he said. Earlier, Merseyside Police said five men had been rebailed until 19 February. The Labour Party has been contacted by the BBC for a comment. A councillor since 1998, Mr Anderson became Liverpool's first directly elected mayor in 2012 and earned a second term in 2016. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Bristol disabled cyclist accused of 'riding drunk',"Nik Royale asked a passing cyclist for help after finding himself ""a bit lost"" on a track in Bristol but was told to ""go home as I should not ride drunk"". Mr Royale, who has cerebral palsy, said: ""I don't have a choice as to whether I wobble and slur my words."" ""People assume and this is just not fair,"" he added. ""I am damned if I am going to wear a T-shirt that says 'I've got cerebral palsy' in Bristol - there would not be enough room on the t-shirt to explain all the symptoms,"" he said. Mr Royale, who is known as Dolphin, said he had borrowed a bike from a friend as he wanted to go and see the Lord Nelson ship in Cumberland Basin at 09:00 BST on Thursday. He said he stopped on the way to ask another cyclist for directions, who told him the way but also suggested he should not be riding a bike while drunk. Mr Royale said he was disappointed because he has always felt fairly treated in Bristol. ""Bristol has a nice big bubble around it as far as the way Bristolians treat disabled people - it's amazing - and I won't let this guy burst it but this kind of thing has to stop,"" he said. ""I'm not afraid to speak out about discrimination but a lot of people either don't talk or can't. ""People should not be afraid to ask whether someone has a disability or not, but on the other hand people with disabilities should not take it personally if asked in a respectful way,"" he said. 'Appalling' Ed Holloway, from the MS Society, said: ""It's appalling to hear about Nik's experience. Unfortunately, this is all too common for people with MS too. ""MS damages nerves in your body and makes it harder to do things, like walk, talk, eat and think. ""Discrimination can make life even harder for people living with an unpredictable condition like MS, and greater public awareness of what symptoms look like is desperately needed. No one should have to put up with this type of mistreatment.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rain forecast as Glastonbury Festival opens,"Fans queued outside the Somerset site from dawn on Wednesday and counted down as the pedestrian gates were opened. They face a wet weekend, with heavy downpours predicted on Thursday and a potential mudbath on Friday. However, it is unlikely to be as bad as 2005, when flash flooding left some of the site under water. Conditions on the opening day are likely to be pleasant, said Louise Lear from BBC Weather. ""If you're going to be putting up a tent in a field, then probably the conditions will be perfect. The ground is not too hard or too soft at the moment, and it should stay dry into the evening,"" she said. ""But by Friday it looks as though the rain, some of it quite heavy, will arrive."" Showers are also predicted for Saturday and Sunday. Parton 'excited' Festival organiser Emily Eavis announced the beginning of the festivities on Twitter, writing: ""The gates are open! Welcome to Glastonbury Festival 2014."" The music begins on some of the smaller stages at lunchtime, but the festival starts in earnest on Friday, when the likes of Lily Allen, Paolo Nutini and Blondie are on the bill. Friday night's headliners are Canadian indie-rock band Arcade Fire, whose carnivalesque live show incorporates choreographed dancers, glitter cannons and fake palm trees. ""It's a great gig, and I think there's a lot of goodwill because of what it means culturally,"" frontman Win Butler told the BBC. Other acts scheduled to play over the weekend include hip-hop provocateur MIA, former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, pop sensation Ed Sheeran and country music legend Dolly Parton. ""I'm excited,"" 68-year-old Parton told the Radio Times. ""I just want to make sure I do the right show. ""I've heard of Glastonbury because it's one of the biggest in the world. For years, everybody's asked me why I've never done it, and I guess it's never worked out where I could, and so now I am."" The audience is being encouraged to perform a special dance routine when Parton plays her signature song, Joelene. Instructions and video have been posted online.

Tony Blair: Hard Irish border would be 'disaster',"The former UK PM said later he believed there was a ""common desire"" to make Northern Ireland a ""special case"" in Brexit negotiations. An open border had done a ""tremendous amount"" for UK and Irish trade and must be safeguarded ""as much as possible"". The British and Irish governments have both said they do not want a return to customs posts on the border. When, as part of Brexit, the UK leaves the EU's customs union there will have to be some from of customs enforcement. 'Extremely anxious' The EU's negotiating guidelines call for a ""flexible and creative"" approach to the customs issue but no solid plans have yet been advanced by either the EU or the UK. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told a joint session of the Irish houses of parliament in Dublin that the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in negotiations but emphasised that there would have to be some form of customs controls between NI and the Republic after Brexit. Mr Blair, who was UK prime minister during the Northern Ireland peace process, was in Wicklow, Ireland to address a meeting of MEPs from the European People's Party - the largest group in the European Parliament. Speaking to RTE Radio before the meeting, Mr Blair said: ""It really would be a disaster to have a hard border."" But following the EPP meeting later he stressed that he believed there was a ""common desire"" to treat Northern Ireland as a ""special case"". He said he was ""extremely anxious"" to ensure Brexit did not damage the Good Friday Agreement - of which he was one of the architects. ""At the moment we have a common travel area where people can travel freely between south and north ... on the island of Ireland. This is vital to maintain."" ""I think whatever disagreements I have with the British government over Brexit more generally, I think there is a real consensus across the British political system that we must do everything we possibly can to keep the present situation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland ... as similar to what we have at the moment as we possibly can."" Mr Barnier, who has been meeting business people in the Irish border region on Friday, told reporters he wanted to find solutions ""without rebuilding any kind of hard border"" and to protect and preserve the Good Friday agreement. ""But we have to find a solution which is compatible with the single market"". He said Brexit negotiations would be ""very complex and difficult"". ""This negotiation will not be only financial, legal or technical. In my view it will first [be] human, social and economic,"" he said. BBC Northern Ireland's economics and business editor John Campbell said the free movement of goods was likely to be a key area of negotiations - and agricultural food companies in particular were extremely concerned about the potential for tariffs which could wreck their business.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Husband fears for her health,"Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, which she denies. Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family have issued a statement about her condition, saying she had been ""complaining of sharp stabbing pains in her breasts"" for more than a year. Breast cancer history They said she had been given a mammogram by the prison's gynaecologist, which gave an inconclusive result. After insisting on seeing an outside specialist, the family said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was then taken to hospital for an ultrasound on Saturday. They said although the doctor thought the lumps were likely to be benign, he did note her family having a history of breast cancer. She was given anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin pills and was to be seen by the specialist again next week to see whether there was any improvement or whether she might need surgery, the family said. The full details of the allegations against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have never been made fully public. She maintains the purpose of her trip to Iran was to visit family and for her daughter to meet her grandparents but speaking in Westminster on 1 November, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to contradict her account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists there. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and his remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. However, her family say there have been no developments on new charges against her since her court appearance. Her lawyer also says he has not been contacted by the Iranian judiciary. In the statement her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, describes his earlier phone conversation with Mr Johnson and says the minister is trying to find time to meet him ""in the next few days"". It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran when she was arrested. He later said he would ""take her husband's assurance"" that she was on holiday. Amid calls for his resignation over the matter, the foreign secretary earlier this week clarified that the UK government had ""no doubt"" that a holiday was the sole purpose of her visit to Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been angered by Mr Johnson's initial remarks and Iranian media coverage of her case. But he restated his belief that it was not in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's interests for anyone to resign.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Kit Harington reveals family connection to the 'Gunpowder Plot',"Some think Guy Fawkes led the plot but it was actually Robert Catesby. Kit wanted to play his relative in the new BBC One drama Gunpowder which tells the story of the failed attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. ""I always knew the connection would be quite a good one to promote it with,"" Kit tells Newsbeat. That wasn't the only famous link to his family during the time of the plot. ""Lord Harington (on his father's side) was in the Houses of Parliament at the time that Catesby was trying to blow it up,"" he explains. ""As Catesby's head was marched past on a pipe, Harington is quoted as saying 'He's an ugly fellow isn't he?' and I thought that is brilliant that my dad's side was slagging off mum's side way back in 1605. ""I wanted to get that line in but it never made it."" This is also his first time as a producer. He says it was really important that they kept the drama as historically accurate as possible, which means there are some violent scenes. Catholics who didn't adhere to King James I's (James VI in Scotland) rules were executed in brutal ways. ""We did the research on how people were hung, drawn and quartered,"" he explains. ""It was important for the story because right from the start we need to know why Robert Catesby embarks upon this very, very violent act. ""At the time, Catholics were being persecuted and there is nothing in this which is not historically accurate. ""So we needed to see something quite violent from the start which makes us understand why this man might do what he does."" But you can't sit down with Kit and not ask about Game of Thrones, the role that will stay with him for the rest of his career. Of course, he didn't give away any plot secrets but revealed he once dressed up as his character for a fancy dress party. ""Recently I went to a 30th birthday party and the theme was bad taste,"" he explains. ""I had left it really late and I was in Aberdeen and I went to the one costume shop in Aberdeen. ""She looked at me and she went, 'You know you look really like the guy from Game of Thrones, I've got a Game of Thrones outfit' and she pulls out a Jon Snow outfit. ""My girlfriend Rose just whispered in my ear 'I won't love you unless you do this.'"" ""So I went to the bad taste party dressed as Jon Snow, which was really embarrassing when the girls bringing around canapÃ©s and drinks were looking at me going, 'You sad man. You have just come to a party dressed as your character.'"" Gunpowder is on BBC One from 21 October.

Reaction: Gravitational waves discovery,"Here's a selection of the reaction to news of the findings. Brian Cox, Royal Society professor for public engagement in science, said: This is a very exciting discovery for two reasons. Firstly, it confirms yet again that Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, published 101 years ago, is a supremely precise description of space-time, gravity and the evolution of the Universe. This opens up an entirely new way of observing the Universe. We can now observe collisions between black holes, probing gravity in ever more exotic and extreme situations, and look back in time far closer to the Big Bang than ever before. Gravitational wave astronomy opens up an entirely new window on nature. Prof Kip Thorne, from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), who originally proposed the LIGO experiment in the 1980s, said: Until now, we have only seen space-time when it's calm. We have only seen the surface of the ocean on a calm day when it's quite glassy. We have never seen the ocean riled by a violent storm with crashing waves before. Dr Szabolcs Marka, an astrophysicist at Columbia University in New York, commented: Until this moment we had our eyes on the sky and we couldn't hear the music... The skies will never be the same. Prof David Reitze, executive director of the LIGO project, which detected the gravitational waves, said: This is truly a scientific Moon-shot and we did it. We landed on the Moon. Up until now we have been deaf to gravitational waves, but today, we are able to hear them. Prof Abhay Ashtekar, theoretical physicist at Penn State University in Pennsylvania, said: It's really comparable only to Galileo taking up the telescope and looking at the planets... Our understanding of the heavens changed dramatically. Prof Alberto Vecchio, from the University of Birmingham, a member of the team, commented: This observation is truly incredible science and marks three milestones for physics: the direct detection of gravitational waves, the first observation of a binary black hole, and the most convincing evidence to-date that Nature's black holes are the objects predicted by Einstein's theory. Prof Karsten Danzmann, from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics and Leibniz University in Hannover, Germany, stated: There is a Nobel Prize in it - there is no doubt. It is the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves; it's the first ever direct detection of black holes and it is a confirmation of General Relativity because the property of these black holes agrees exactly with what Einstein predicted almost exactly 100 years ago.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
August Bank Holiday: Where to avoid on roads and rail,"Major work on the railways will mean no trains in or out of London Euston on Saturday and Sunday. The vast majority of roadworks on motorways were completed or lifted by Friday morning, with work not set to resume until Tuesday. However, 36 sets of roadworks will stay in place for safety reasons, with some stretching more than 20 miles. And a serious incident on the M1 near Newport Pagnell on Saturday morning, in which eight people have died, caused major disruption. Part of the M1 southbound, which had been closed, has since reopened. When will be busiest? According to the RAC, the busiest day overall will be Monday, with about five million cars on the roads for ""leisure trips"" as people either go for days out - or return from a weekend away. This is double the number the RAC expected to see on Thursday following a survey of motorists' plans for the weekend. The busiest roads are expected to be the M5 towards Exeter; the M6 and then A590 around the Lake District; the M3 towards Bournemouth and the M1 north from London. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: ""While summer appears to have taken a leave of absence for many of us, our figures suggest drivers are undeterred and are still keen to make the most of the long weekend to spend time with friends and family in the UK. ""We recommend motorists wanting to beat the queues travel outside peak times... try to get away in good time if you are planning a day trip on Monday, or face a long journey home at the end of a summer holiday."" Where are the roadworks? Most roadworks on motorways were removed by 06:00 BST on Friday. Highways England, which manages the motorway network, said it would lift or complete about 98% of all work before the bank holiday, freeing up 445 miles of roads. Those that have stayed in place cannot be removed for safety reasons, the organisation said. Is my train running? Rail engineering works are taking place over the weekend. Francis Paonessa, managing director for infrastructure projects at Network Rail, said: ""While our massive investment programme impacts comparatively small parts of the network, on some routes its impact is significant, particularly major routes into London."" There is no planned rail engineering work affecting Leeds, which is expected to see thousands of people travelling to the Leeds Festival at Bramham Park over the bank holiday weekend.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Subsidy for non-existent flights costs Stormont Â£2.3m a year,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The deduction was part of the deal which allowed long-haul air passenger duty (APD) to be devolved in 2012. APD was then cut to zero to support a service between Belfast and New York. As that meant less revenue was being collected in Northern Ireland, Â£2.3m had to be returned to the Treasury from Stormont's budget. There have been no regular transatlantic flights from Northern Ireland since October 2018 when Norwegian ended its service, although there have been a small number of seasonal holiday flights to Florida and Las Vegas. 'Bear the financial consequences' However, the Â£2.3m continues to be deducted from Stormont's budget. The details were uncovered by the SDLP Assembly Member Matthew O'Toole. The Department of Finance spokesman said the money was ""required under state aid rules which dictate that the Assembly must bear the financial consequences of devolving any tax"". The Department of Finance had told Mr O'Toole: ""The mechanism for applying that reduction to our budget was set at the time devolution was agreed in 2012 and has been applied every year since then"". Mr O'Toole said the situation was ""absurd"". ""We are paying for the privilege of having theoretically zero taxes on long haul travel despite not having had a single route since 2018 - and there being precious little prospect of any routes for the foreseeable future. ""This is all the more shocking when one considers the dire prospects for our much more critical short-haul connectivity to Great Britain."" He is calling for the Treasury to waive the annual deduction and suggested the chance of a successful state aid case against the UK ""would be zero"" given the current turmoil in global aviation. In their statement on Thursday, the Department of Finance added: ""The cost relates to the amount that was payable on devolving the power to set the rate and not the Duty that would be payable in respect of current flights,"" he said. ""The mechanism for applying the reduction was agreed in 2012 when the Executive sought to maintain valuable air connectivity to the US. ""It is disappointing that these services have ceased, but having a zero rate of direct long haul APD will help us in trying to attract long haul services as we seek to recovery from this crisis.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coroner in plea to Shropshire Council over river safety,"The body of Hayden Reynolds-Evans, 18, from Shrewsbury, was found in the River Severn in the town in March. Coroner John Ellery wrote to Shropshire Council before about the river around the time of a previous inquest. The council said land along the river was managed by various landowners and they were working together. Vodka bottle On 1 February Mr Reynolds-Evans had travelled to Liverpool for a friend's birthday, Shrewsbury Magistrates' Court heard. They had been drinking all day, on the train up, in Liverpool and they had a bottle of vodka on the train down, the court was told. It heard Mr Reynolds-Evans was due to play darts at the Bird in Hand, he was late and he ran off leaving his friends at Shrewsbury station. He was next seen holding a vodka bottle by the landlord of the Albion Vaults pub, who refused to serve him because he was drunk, the inquest was told. The body of Mr Reynolds-Evans, from Castle Street, Shrewsbury, was found on 13 March. The coroner said: ""I've heard no evidence of self harm or suicide at all."" He ruled out foul play on the basis that forensic reports showed no evidence Mr Reynolds-Evans was attacked. He also ruled out suicide after various witnesses said Mr Reynolds-Evans was happy at the time. The coroner read a statement from the West Mercia force, which said police have been called to 94 incidents in or near the River Severn in Shrewsbury in the past six years. There had been 23 deaths in the river in the town, the inquest heard. 'Number of measures' Mr Ellery addressed the family in connection with writing to the council again. He said: ""I know this will give no comfort to you, but I'm going to do it regardless."" In a statement, Tim Sneddon, the council's head of environmental maintenance, said: ""The land alongside the river is managed by various different landowners. ""We are all working together to raise awareness of the dangers of the river and we have already completed a number of measures to make it safer."" He said these measures have included installing additional life buoys alongside the river and reviewing all inspection and maintenance procedures and policies. Mr Sneddon added that a weekly meeting was being held with Shrewsbury Town Council ""to ensure that the medium and longer term measures are evaluated and progressed as soon as possible"".

Welsh A&E waiting time target missed again,"The latest figures from the Welsh government show 84.3% patients were treated within four hours in March and it rose to 85.9% in April. It remains below the Welsh government target to admit, transfer or discharge 95% of patients within that time. The Welsh government said pressures on emergency care was a UK-wide problem. The 99% target for patients to spend less than eight hours in A&E was also missed, with 93.3% treated within the time frame in March and 94.5% in April. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The pressure on emergency care services can be linked to an increase in the number of acutely ill elderly patients who have complex needs. ""These patients often suffer from a number of conditions which can result in longer lengths of stay in hospital. ""The current pressures on emergency care services are a UK wide problem but it is important to note that Wales has the largest proportion of people over 85."" The spokesperson said Health Minister Mark Drakeford recognised that more needed to be done to ensure ""delivery of unscheduled care"" and improving these services was a priority for the Welsh government. ""We are expecting unscheduled care improvement action plans from all Local Health Boards and the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust shortly, and will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" the spokesperson added. Kirsty Williams has called for significant improvements in the performance of A&E departments in Wales. 'Appalling' Ms Williams, the Brecon and Radnorshire AM, described the figures as appalling and said ""only further highlight how badly the Welsh Labour government has mismanaged our NHS"". ""While the Welsh Labour government's own A&E targets have never once been met, we would expect there to be at least signs of steady improvement,"" she added. ""Sadly, that is far from the case. In fact, the figures for March are the worst they have been in more than a year."" The A&E figures have marked a bad week for health service target time results. Earlier this week, it was revealed that waiting time targets for urgent cancer cases in Wales were being missed too, despite a pledge they would be met by March. The Welsh government target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in 62 days, but the latest figure is 84%. The Welsh Ambulance Service has also missed its response time target for the most urgent cases for the 11th month in a row despite an improved performance.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Forestry England names its first writers in residence,"Zakiya Mckenzie, from Bristol, and Tiffany Francis, from Petersfield, Hampshire, won a competition to mark the commission's centenary. Writers in the Forest sought applicants from underrepresented groups to ""diversify nature writing"". Ms Mckenzie said it showed the organisation's commitment to diversity. She said: ""By choosing me for the role, Forestry England have explicitly shown that they are committed to hearing and sharing marginalised voices. She said she hopes her point of view in the one-year residency role is seen as ""valuable as a British person telling a British story"". ""By extending the pen and platform to me they have actively validated my voice to the nature and nature writing public,"" she added. ""It's easy for people to think I've got here just because I'm black, that's fine for now but, holla at me when you've actually read what I produce and say that with a straight face"". Ms Mckenzie is currently studying a PhD in literature on the tradition of Black British journalism from the 1940s onwards. She said: ""The 'sharing' is really important here; Forestry England have a huge operation and are an authority on British nature. "" Both women will be taken on a tour of the nation's woodlands to help inspire their stories. Author, artist and environmentalist Miss Francis, hopes to use the role to ""delve right into the heart of Britain's forest."" She said: ""Everything I do is inspired by environmentalism, creativity and a passion for the natural world, and I also follow a vegan, minimalist lifestyle to rebalance my relationship with the planet. ""I think the most important aspect of my work is to try and connect our species with the rest of the ecosystem - to remind us all that we are part of nature, and that nature writing is essentially writing about ourselves."" She is currently working on her third book, Dark Skies, but also writes and illustrates magazine features. Both women's work will be published at the end of 2019, the same time as the tree-planting season. Now known as Forestry England, the Forestry Commission was established in September 1919 to replenish the UK's timber reserves after World War One.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
International GCSEs to be axed from school league tables,"The change is part of the government's overhaul of the exam system in England. New GCSEs in maths and English, which feature little or no coursework and exams after two years, will be introduced in September 2015. The 2017 league tables will include only the new qualifications - IGCSEs, which are unchanged, will not count. Currently, both IGCSEs and GCSEs count in the league tables. Key qualifications Ministers are understood to have made the change as IGCSEs generally do not share the same construction as the government's reformed qualifications - in terms of the amount of coursework and the timing of exams. English and maths GCSEs are key qualifications for schools as they are judged on their results in these subjects. New GCSEs in other subjects, such as science, history and geography are due to be introduced in 2016, with the first exams taken in 2018. IGCSEs in these subjects are likewise due to be dropped from the 2018 rankings. IGCSEs could be reintroduced at a later date if changes were made to ensure they were of a similar design to the new GCSEs. The measure has drawn a qualified welcome from head teachers. Brian Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""It is important that all qualifications that count in performance tables have an equal level of challenge, and we support moves to ensure that this will be the case in future."" However Mr Lightman said news of the changes to the status of IGCSEs in England had emerged ""very late in the day"". ""The position of IGCSEs should have been carefully planned and thought through much earlier as part of the government's overall approach to qualification reform,"" he said. ""This failure to develop an overall vision and work out the consequences in advance is leading to real difficulty in schools."" 'Serious consequences' He said schools ""which, in all good faith, had planned to continue using IGCSE qualifications"", would have to reconsider those plans. ""It also has serious consequences for young people,"" he said. ""Parents and young people are finding it difficult to make sense of these contradictory and piecemeal changes."" IGCSEs have long been favoured by private schools, but there has been a surge in the number of state schools using IGCSEs after the government decided to drop the speaking and listening element of English GCSE from the overall grade and report it separately. Some schools enter pupils for both qualifications in the same subject.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scottish Gin Society rapped over Facebook adverts,"Complaints over 10 ""light-hearted"" Facebook posts by the Scottish Gin Society (SGS) have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). It ruled the ads encouraged excessive drinking and implied alcohol could lead to sexual success, among other things. SGS claimed the posts were memes and therefore were not in ASA's remit. It added it was ""the most po-faced, fun-free, nanny-state judgement imaginable"". The posts have since been removed. The ASA had been alerted to a number of Facebook entries, seen around the turn of the year, by Aberdeenshire Alcohol and Drug Partnership. The authority ruled three of them encouraged excessive drinking. One featured an image of a glass of gin and tonic accompanied by the text: ""Shut up liver, you're fine! Gin?"" The image featured the SGS logo and was captioned: ""Come on, be honest. How many of you are thinking this right now?"" Another post read: ""I only drink gin on two occasions: When I'm thirsty and when I'm not thirsty"". Two other posts were found to have contravened rules covering nutrition and health claims made on foods. One read: ""This gin and tonic has 91 calories. A banana has 105 calories. My doctor told me to make the healthy choice. I love my doctor."" A further four posts were found to have implied alcohol had therapeutic qualities and could enhance physical and mental capabilities. One referred to gin as being able to ""settle nerve disturbances and period cramps"", while another featured the text ""gin distilled for the eradication of seemingly incurable sadness"". The ASA acknowledged the captions had been ""presented in a light-hearted tone"" but ""still implied that gin could help people overcome emotional problems, and treat depression and pain, and that the ads therefore suggested that gin had therapeutic qualities and could help to treat health conditions"". 'Humour Bypass Award' The gin society had argued its Facebook posts did not fall within the remit of the ASA as they did not sell or promote any products or receive income from the sale of third-party products. But the authority said it considered the posts were subject to advertising rules, because they were ""directly connected to the promotion of the Scottish Gin Society's membership service and the intention to sell gin, which was therefore directly connected to the supply of Scottish gin"". A spokesman for SGS said: ""The ASA freely admits in its judgement that these posts were light-hearted and humorous and they aren't even adverts - nor did we write them. ""They were re-posts of funny memes to members by a not-for-profit organisation so shouldn't fall under the ASA's remit. ""We completely support responsible drinking, but if this is justice then I am a Long Island iced tea."" SGS, which is sponsoring the Scottish Gin Awards in Glasgow later this month, said it would be nominating the ASA for the ""Humour Bypass Award"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Neo-Nazi group led by 13-year-old boy to be banned,"By Daniel De SimoneBBC News Feuerkrieg Division, an international group that largely existed online, said earlier this year it had dissolved. But Home Secretary Priti Patel has now asked Parliament for permission to outlaw it in the UK. This would make it a criminal offence to be a member of or invite support for the group. Ms Patel said: ""This vile white supremacist group advocates violence and seeks to sow division, targeting young and vulnerable people online."" A Home Office statement said the organisation advocated the ""use of violence and mass murder in pursuit of an apocalyptic race war"". The statement added that, in retaliation for the arrest of one of its British followers last year, the group distributed a list of police buildings and an image of a senior police officer with a gun to his head and the words ""race traitor"" across his eyes, urging followers to carry out attacks. FKD was created in late 2018 and sought recruits online, particularly through its channels on encrypted messaging applications. The group's ideology promoted the idea that society will collapse into racial warfare - thus opening the way for the creation of a neo-Nazi state - and that this process should be accelerated through terrorist activity. National Action and Sonnenkrieg Division - both created in the UK - are the only neo-Nazi groups to have previously been added to the government's list of proscribed terrorist organisations, which has over 80 entries. Campaigners at Hope not Hate welcomed the proposed ban of FKD, but said the government was ""behind the curve"" and that the ""move to proscription fits the existing pattern of diminishing or defunct groups being banned long after their threat has passed."" Applicants for FKD membership were required to put up propaganda posters in their local area and send photos to the leader. The boy, who used the alias Commander, was identified this year by the Estonian Internal Security Service, which has said that under its legal system ""young children can't be legally held responsible for crimes"" and therefore ""these cases have to be treated by other legal means to protect the child from himself and also protect everybody else from a suspected threat"". People linked to the group are the subject of court cases around the world. There are three ongoing counter-terrorism prosecutions in the UK connected to FKD. In February, an American member - who had discussed setting fire to a Las Vegas synagogue - admitted a firearms offence following a counter-terrorism investigation. During the same month, a US soldier linked to the group pleaded guilty to distributing information related to explosives, destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction. In Lithuania, an alleged teenage member is charged with leaving a bomb - which failed to explode - outside an office in its capital city last year. Police said he was found in possession of bomb-making materials and an improvised firearm.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Self-employed bailout âproblematicâ,"By Faisal IslamEconomics editor Rishi Sunak, however, repeatedly spelt out difficulties in applying the same terms as his recent bailout for staff. He refused to commit to a precise date for help, saying there were issues about the fairness of any scheme. Mr Sunak said addressing the issue was ""incredibly complicated"" and admitted that it was ""proving problematic."" The Chancellor has spoken with groups representing workers and businesses to try and find a solution. But he stressed it was not just a matter of looking at the tax returns of five million workers who have some self-employment income. ""Of course there are people whose incomes have been enormously impacted by what is going on currently, but there are also millions of people who are self-employed whose incomes may not have been impacted and, indeed, might be increasing. ""The ability of the government to distinguish between those people, based on tax returns that are over a year-and-a-half out of date, poses some very significant challenges in terms of fairness and affordability,"" he said at Treasury questions. 'Problematic' The ""challenge"" the chancellor told MPs was in ""designing something that gets to the people who we want to help, while at the same time being affordable and not having to benefit absolutely everybody. ""That is proving to be problematic, but we are hard at work on it."" Mr Sunak went on to say that a self-employment scheme would require another ""brand-new system"" to deliver, and suggested that the priority would be ""the scheme that we have set up for 90% of the workforce who are employed should be delivered first and quickly, and that is what we have committed to do, ideally by the end of April"". Acknowledging the anxiety of the self-employed, the chancellor pointed to help given on deferring VAT, interest-free loans, and changes to the tax credit and Universal Credit systems. Answering a subsequent urgent question in the House, Mr Sunak's deputy, Steve Barclay, stressed that there were significantly fewer than five million likely claimants. One million of that number were tax returns for less than Â£2,000, so mainly sources of additional income for a main job. Up to another million were already in receipt of Universal Credit. Around half a million were older than the state pension age. Again he repeatedly suggested that some self-employed workers might even be earning more now than before. The key problem, is that some control on numbers and against abuse of the employer scheme was introduced by insisting claims for 80% taxpayer wage subsidy can only be made by companies who register workers as ""furloughed"" with the HMRC, ie granted a formal leave of absence, but that doesn't exist with self employment. Many MPs urged the government to move quickly with an imperfect scheme, even accepting that might give some money to those not in need.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Windows 7 hardest hit by WannaCry worm,"More than 97% of the infections seen by Kaspersky Lab and 66% of those seen by BitSight used the older software. WannaCry started spreading in mid-May and, so far, has infected more than 200,000 computers around the world. In the UK, some hospitals had to turn away patients as the worm shut down computer systems. Many suggested that the reason UK hospitals suffered was because many of them still relied on programs that required Windows XP - a version of Microsoft's OS that debuted in 2001. But infections of XP by WannaCry were ""insignificant"" said Costin Raiu from Kaspersky Lab. Windows 7 was first released in 2009 and the most widely infected version was the x64 edition, which is widely used in large organisations, showed figures from Kasperksy. Many organisations seem to have been caught out because they failed to apply a patch, issued by Microsoft in March. that blocked the vulnerability which WannaCry exploited. Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, German rail firm Deutsche Bahn, logistics firm Fedex, Russia's interior ministry and 61 NHS organisations were all caught out by WannaCry. After encrypting files, the WannaCry worm demanded a payment of Â£230 ($300) in bitcoins before they were unfrozen. So far, a reported 296 payments totalling $99,448 (Â£76,555) have been made to the bitcoin wallets tied to the ransomware. There have been no reports that anyone who paid has had their data restored by the gang behind the attack. Security experts also found that the worm spread largely by seeking out vulnerable machines on the net by itself. Before now, many thought it had got started via an email-based phishing campaign. Adam McNeil, a senior malware analyst at Malwarebytes, said the worm was primed to look for machines vulnerable to a bug in a Microsoft technology known as the Server Message Block (SMB). ""The attackers initiated an operation to hunt down vulnerable public facing SMB ports and, once located, used the newly available SMB exploits to deploy malware and propagate to other vulnerable machines within connected networks,"" he wrote. Mr McNeil said he suspected that whoever was behind the worm first identifed a ""few thousand"" vulnerable machines which were used as the launch platform for the much larger waves of infection.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Neil McEvoy: Commission reconsiders decision to recognise new party,"The Electoral Commission is reconsidering whether to officially register the Welsh National Party. It follows a threatened legal challenge by Plaid Cymru. Mr McEvoy said the decision was shocking but Plaid Cymru said it was a recognition ""the commission had acted unlawfully"". A spokesman for the party said: ""Plaid Cymru will always protect its historic name and we are confident that this matter will be resolved in a manner that allows us to continue doing so."" Neil McEvoy was elected as a Plaid Cymru AM in 2016 but was later expelled from the party. After trying to reapply for membership and later abandoning his application, the independent politician set up his own party. Although it got recognition from the Electoral Commission in January for the English name, the body refused to register the Welsh translation of Welsh National Party - Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru - because it said voters would find it confusing. Plaid Cymru was founded as Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru in the 1920s. Plaid threatened to take the commission to court for judicial review, claiming it was ""irrational"" to maintain the English language registration having rejected the Welsh language version. The party argued officials had not given adequate reasons to explain why the English name Welsh National Party would be unlikely to cause confusion. In a letter circulated by Mr McEvoy, the electoral commission said the decision to reconsider the application ""means that the decision of 15th January 2020 to register your Party is of no effect and the Commission will now treat your application as a new application"". ""I apologise on behalf of the Commission for the inconvenience caused to your party and assure you we will endeavour to complete procedure and reach a final decision as soon as reasonably practicable,"" it added. Mr McEvoy, Member of the Senedd for South Wales Central, said: ""We have complied with every regulation the Electoral Commission has and already submitted our quarterly electoral returns. We have done absolutely everything by the book. When the Commission rejected our proposed Welsh language name, claiming it could be confusing, we accepted the decision immediately and proposed a different one."" ""For the Commission to simply deregister our party is truly shocking,"" he added. The commission said: ""We have received a complaint regarding the registration of the Welsh National Party. Having considered this complaint, we have decided to consider the registration application afresh, allowing interested parties to share their views on the application as part of the process.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Soap bubble screen is 'the world's thinnest display',"An international team produced a display that uses ultrasonic sound waves to alter film's properties and create either a flat or a 3D image. The bubble mixture is more complex than the one sold in stores for children, but soap is still the main ingredient. The team says the display is the world's thinnest transparent screen. ""It is common knowledge that the surface of soap bubble is a micro membrane. It allows light to pass through and displays the colour on its structure,"" the lead researcher, Yoichi Ochiai from the University of Tokyo, wrote in his blog . ""We developed an ultra-thin and flexible BRDF [bidirectional reflectance distribution function, a four-dimensional function defining how light is reflected at an opaque surface] screen using the mixture of two colloidal liquids."" Although traditional screens are opaque, the display created by Dr Ochiai and his colleagues Keisuke Toyoshima from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and Alexis Oyama from the Carnegie Mellon University in the US, varies in transparency and reflectance. Using sound The team managed to control and exploit these properties by hitting the bubble's membrane with ultrasonic sound waves, played through speakers. Sonic waves alter the texture of a projected image, making it look smooth or rough. ""Typical screens will show every image the same way, but images should have different visual properties,"" Dr Oyama told the BBC. ""For example, a butterfly's wings should be reflective and a billiard ball should be smooth, and our transparent screen can change the reflection in real time to show different textures."" To change the transparency of the projected image, the scientists modified the wave's frequency. ""Our membrane screen can be controlled using ultrasonic vibrations. Membrane can change its transparency and surface states depending on the scales of ultrasonic waves,"" wrote Dr Ochiai in his blog. ""The combination of the ultrasonic waves and ultra thin membranes makes more realistic, distinctive, and vivid imageries on screen. ""This system contributes to open up a new path for display engineering with sharp imageries, transparency, BRDF and flexibility."" If several bubble screens are put together, viewers get a 3D effect and even a holographic projection. The bubble is much harder to burst than a regular soap bubble, as the mixture contains special colloids - and objects can even pass through the film without popping it. The team said such a screen could be useful for artists to provide a realistic feel to their works, for museums - for instance, to display floating planets, and for magicians as well. Previously, there have been attempts to develop untraditional displays - a computer screen out of water and a touchscreen out of ice.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Oil firms 'need fresh strategies' says PwC report,"PwC said companies should be looking to deploy fresh strategies, following a sustained fall in the price of oil. It suggested they should look to reduce costs ""in a sustainable manner"" and find efficiencies by keeping tax costs in control. Other suggestions included divesting non-core parts of their business. PwC argued that firms might also want to identify and invest in strategic acquisitions to secure market position in key areas. The report's authors said the UK oil and gas sector would have been in a much better place ""to weather the oil price maelstrom"", had it heeded 30%-40% cost reduction warnings which surfaced 12-18 months ago. 'Knee-jerk reactions' The report said there was still time for firms to ""learn the harsh lessons of past languor"" by adopting fresh strategies. But it also warned that to achieve that, they needed to get away from ""short term knee-jerk reactions"" seen in previous downturns - or risk damaging the long term future of the industry. PwC cited significant downsizing undertaken during the downturn of 1999-2000, arguing that the industry had struggled since then with talent retention. It said ""aggressive price negotiation"" and contract revisions with the oil services sector would also do little to create a collaborative environment. The report argued that companies must answer ""hard questions"" about whether they can continue to invest in the sector, or if they should instead ""move on"". But it stressed the need for the industry to take a long-term view, adding that ""intelligent and strategic cost-cutting"" could ""position players well through this turmoil"". 'New dawn' Brian Campbell, oil and gas capital projects director at PwC and co-author of the report, said: ""With economists predicting low oil prices throughout 2015, UK oil and gas firms are not out of the woods by any means. ""They are still at risk of an economic triple-whammy: as the falling oil price reduces income, incremental investment may no longer be economic with a risk that field life diminishes and decommissioning is accelerated. ""The stark reality is that firms need to be able to operate in an environment where oil averages at $50 per barrel - only then can it be truly fit for the future."" He added: ""We've been talking about cost reduction and restructuring within the industry for several years now, and the harsh truth is that if many larger exploration and production and oil field services firms had implemented programmes before the oil price crisis hit, then the industry would be in a much better place to weather the storm that is currently raging. ""But it's not too late to glean some good out of adversity and for businesses to work together to create their own new dawn for the North Sea. ""There are a series of levers business leaders can pull, which, as we've seen in the past, can lead to long-term sustained efficiencies and opportunities for their business and the wider industry.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Child sex abuse inquiry: Priest 'tried to control' investigation,"A former North Yorkshire detective said officers were ""excluded"" from inquiries at Ampleforth College in 1995 and 2002. But former head teacher Father Leo Chamberlain denied influencing a boy's parents during a phone call in 1995. He told the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse there had been ""no skulduggery"". The Catholic Church is one of 13 public organisations being scrutinised by the inquiry, which is being headed by Prof Alexis Jay. 'Direct approach' Det Supt Barry Honeysett said he had told Fr Chamberlain in 2003 that he did not trust the private school, because alleged victims of abuse had been spoken to by staff before police were called in. Mr Honeysett, who led an inquiry into abuse at Ampleforth College, said: ""The issue was largely around the delay in the police becoming involved. ""A direct approach had been made to the victim which I felt was inappropriate."" Earlier in the hearing, the priest was questioned about another policy officer, Det Sgt Hartnett, who was involved investigating allegations at Ampleforth. Lead counsel to the inquiry Riel Karmy-Jones put it to Fr Chamberlain that Det Sgt Hartnett believed the priest was trying to ""control the investigation"". Fr Chamberlain, who began working at the school in 1961, said the suggestion was ""completely subjective"". He said he had to spoken to the boy's parents to inform them of the situation and in doing so, had ""made no obstruction"" to the police inquiry. Evidence was heard that the Abbott of Ampleforth, Fr Timothy Wright, went to visit a complainant of child sex abuse, causing mistrust between the Church and North Yorkshire Police. Speaking via video link, Fr Chamberlain - head teacher at Ampleforth between 1992 and 2003 - said police thought there was a conspiracy between him and Fr Wright ""to close the matter down"", which he said was not the case. Fr Chamberlain told the inquiry that during the 1980s, a teacher who had abused pupils would ""be got rid of and it was thought wrongly that to keep it all very quiet was in the best interests of the victim"". 'Goldfish bowl' An earlier hearing was told the former head teacher was warned about employing Fr Piers Grant-Ferris - who was later jailed for abusing boys. Grant-Ferris, who the pupils had nicknamed ""Pervy Piers"", was convicted of 20 counts of indecent assault in 2006. The inquiry was shown a letter by a psychologist employed by the school, Elizabeth Mann, who wrote in 2003 that Grant-Ferris and a second monk posed a risk to pupils. At the time, Fr Chamberlain said he thought it was safe to employ Grant-Ferris in the abbey's shop, which he had described as ""something of a goldfish bowl"", regularly visited by guests and students. He told the inquiry: ""Because it was a very visible place I thought well, we could probably make it work. But I think I could have been wrong about that.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
FE funding body threat over sixth form involvement,"Colleges Wales says its backing for a new funding commission is in question unless school sixth forms are part of its remit. The new body would replace the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (Hefcw) and cover colleges, workplace learning and universities. The Welsh government says it will consider responses to a consultation. Plans for a body to oversee post-compulsory education and training were set out by the government following a review by education expert Prof Ellen Hazelkorn. The proposals include scrapping Hefcw and setting up a new body with a wider remit - the Tertiary Education and Research Commission for Wales. Colleges Wales, which represents Wales' further education colleges, says it supports moves to ""break down silos"" but says school sixth forms must be included in order for it to succeed. Chief executive Iestyn Davies said sixth form provision in schools and colleges should be covered by the same body. He said: ""It doesn't make sense to us to separate the two parts of provision that are equally important for the future of post-16 education and training in Wales. ""If that commitment is not made by the cabinet secretary and the government going forward, we really question the extent we can support the creation of the body in the first place."" He added: ""We have deep concerns about trying to support an agency or a body that we believe would end up being set up to fail. ""What we want is the best provision made in order to get the best outcomes for our learners and that must be including sixth form. ""It is highly unlikely that it would get our unequivocal support if it doesn't include sixth form within its remit."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We welcome Colleges Wales' contribution to our recently closed consultation on a commission to oversee skills and the higher and further education sectors in Wales. ""Our White Paper included specific questions on the potential role of the commission in relation to sixth forms. We will now take time to consider the responses to the White Paper before issuing a further technical consultation in the new year.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dinas Dinlle beach erosion plan unveiled,"It is believed a flood defence built to protect Dinas Dinlle near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, from coastal flooding in 1994 has made the problem worse. Environment Agency Wales was outlining its plans for tackling the problem on Wednesday. The agency said this would include moving a section of the Wales Coast Path. Wyn Williams, chair of the of the Dinas Dinlle regeneration group, said the community was originally told work would not be carried out for at least 10 years but was now scheduled for autumn. ""I think there's been an admission, certainly by the agency who I don't think carried out the work 20 years ago, that probably the groyne was built slightly too high so the northern end of the beach was... not being replenished,"" he said. ""We hope to convince the agency to start the work and to get it right."" He said he did not yet know the full details of the plans but the agency had already released some information. The proposals include realigning part of the existing shingle beach and moving a section of the coastal footpath, which is being damaged by erosion. And the large rocks on the beach would be replaced by natural shingle ""to make the beach more user-friendly"". Mr Williams said Dinas Dinlle was ""one of the most popular beaches in Wales and is a longstanding blue flag award beach and is of international repute"". ""We have people from all over the world to visit our wonderful beach but I think more importantly, Dinas Dinlle is used widely by local people,"" he added. 'Natural process' Environment Agency Wales is holding drop-in sessions on Wednesday explaining the plans to the public. David Edwell, from the agency, said: ""Coastal erosion is a natural process, but at Dinas Dinlle this seems to have been disrupted by the coastal defences and we need to correct the imbalance. ""These new plans we are proposing will help to reduce erosion from impacting further on the area, and at the same time safeguard the Wales Coastal Path and local tourism which the area is dependent upon.""

Hobbit fans given taster of new Peter Jackson film,"The taster, showing Martin Freeman in the role of young Bilbo Baggins, is among a number of trailers released this week for 2012's big films. A trailer for Batman film The Dark Knight Rises came out on Monday, after a six-minute prologue that was shown in cinemas earlier this month. A pre-trailer tease for Ridley Scott's Prometheus has also came out. The 30-second promo for the sci-fi thriller, which is expected to be released in June, shows a glimpse of its star Michael Fassbender examining a mystery specimen. The full cinema trailer is due out on Thursday. 'Statement of intent' Jackson's first part of The Hobbit, the prequel to his Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, will not be released until 13 December next year. The new trailer also shows the return of Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and opens with an older Bilbo - played by Sir Ian Holm - telling Frodo in a letter that he may not have told him everything about his adventures. Andy Serkis makes an appearance as Gollum in the trailer, as does Cate Blanchett, reprising her role as mystical elf queen Galadriel. The US press has already given its verdict on the first taste of the film, with Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times writing: ""While it was all too fleeting, there was enough in it to stir the hearts of fans."" Jen Chaney of the Washington Post said: ""That noise you hear? That's the sound of JRR Tolkien nerds and Jackson lovers weeping with joy."" But she added that the only bad news is that the trailer is for a film that will not be released for another year. The trailer for British director Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale's final outing as Batman shows several set-piece action sequences, alongside footage of Anne Hathaway's Catwoman. The first six minutes of the film are also being shown in Imax cinemas ahead of screenings of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Warner Bros. is the studio behind both The Hobbit and The Dark Knight Rises. Dan Jolin, features editor at Empire Magazine, says it is the first year he can remember so many trailers on offer, so far in advance of release dates. ""I think the studio is extremely keen to be showing off to the world how impressive its slate is for 2012. ""Quite simply, they are foghorning a bold statement of intent - dominance of the 2012 box office. He adds that the long-lead nature of film trailers is a response to the internet and social media, enabling studios to retain ownership of their films. ""Studios need to get their product in people's minds, they need to feed anticipation, they want to make us feel that when opening weekend comes, we simply must go and see their movie, otherwise we'll be somehow socially and culturally left behind everyone else.""

Civic and airport officials have come out in support of Cardiff as a suitable city to host a Euro 2020 game, despite Uefa's two-airport rule. The Welsh government is currently negotiating to buy Wales' only international airport from its owners, in a move that one South West England MEP has claimed could threaten Bristol Airport. But a spokesman for Bristol Airport said it should already be seen as a second airport for people going in and out of Wales. He said: ""Bristol Airport already serves as an additional gateway for thousands of overseas visitors to events in Wales, including rugby matches at the Millennium Stadium, every year. He said the airport would be willing to provide ""any information required"" for Cardiff to meet Uefa's criteria regarding airport access for Euro 2020 fixtures. Global audience Cardiff council's cabinet member for sport, leisure and culture, Huw Thomas, said that as well as being served by Bristol Airport, Cardiff was also only two hours by train from London. He said: ""Over the last decade, Cardiff has played host to numerous leading sporting events that have been watched by a global audience of billions. ""Successfully delivering events such as FA Cup finals, Olympic football games, the Rugby World Cup and Ashes cricket have earned the city an unparalleled reputation for sporting events. ""The Millennium Stadium, with its capacity to close its roof, is acknowledged as one of the premier sporting venues, not just in Europe but the world and Cardiff also boasts great hotels and an infrastructure that has made it very popular with sports fans who have attended matches here."" A spokeswoman for Cardiff Airport said: ""Details of how Cardiff Airport will manage the 2020 matches have been submitted based on previous experience, operational ability and capacity. ""Cardiff Airport has extensive experience in handling large special events over many years, for example the Ryder Cup, Six Nations, Heineken Cup and the Rugby World Cup, with a proven track record in the planning, preparation and management this type of large volume traffic, the passengers, their welfare, safety and security. ""The airport offers a professional and bespoke service to the teams, organisers and supporters having sufficient capacity for aircraft parking, coaching and an efficient passenger flow.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
London Underground: How does the Tube compare globally?,"By Nick TarverBBC News Transport for London (TfL) has announced that every ticket office on the Tube is to shut by 2015, with the loss of 750 jobs. The move has provoked the wrath of the RMT union, which has not ruled out strike action in the run-up to Christmas. Since the construction of the first underground railway line in 1864, other cities around the world have copied London's transport system. But in the 21st Century, is London's system still the envy of the world and how have other countries embraced the future? Seoul Metropolitan Subway It is consistently ranked as the best subway system in the world. The Seoul Metropolitan Subway introduced one of the first contactless tickets in 1996, whereas London's Oyster Card only began life in 2003. Commuters can also use their smartphones to pay for travel at ticket barriers. And, all carriages in Seoul have wifi, 4G access and TV screens. They even have heated seats in the winter. But despite this seemingly futuristic system, London is similar in one crucial respect - Seoul still has ticket offices at its stations. Believed to be the second most-used metro system in the world after Seoul, it is also perhaps the most beautiful. The lavish decorations at stations like Komsomolskaya were ordered by Stalin, intended to inspire awe in passengers. However, the metro service is not stuck in the past. It is thought to have been the first to completely phase out paper tickets, favouring the contactless payment system like London's Oyster. However, even with the latest announcements from TfL, paper tickets seem set to continue at Tube stations for the foreseeable future. It is unlikely that London's ticket staff, who will be moved out of the office and on to the platform, will be pushing commuters on to trains. But in rush hour Tokyo, attendants have to forcibly shove travellers into carriages to make the most of available space. Regular tickets are purchased there with automated vending machines, doing away completely with ticket offices. However, in a select few stations there are staff available to directly sell you multiple, or special season, tickets. With its driverless trains, Copenhagen is perhaps the paradise that many would like to see London Underground become. The fully-automated system operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with a new circular line opening in 2018. A control room keeps watch over the trains as they travel on set arrival and departure times. Passengers also have the ability to make direct radio contact with the control room from the train. Despite the driverless Docklands Light Railway being in operation since 1987, other lines in London all have drivers. Mayor Boris Johnson promised driverless trains in London by 2012 to cut costs, with the current starting salary for a Tube driver being about Â£44,000.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
European Commission predicts 'turning point' in Europe,"The Commission said there were ""signs of hope"" that had started to turn into ""tangible positive outcomes"". But in the eurozone - the 18 nations that use the euro - it predicted growth of 1.1% next year. This is the second downward revision of 2014 eurozone growth this year, after it was cut from 1.4% to 1.2% in May. The Commission forecast that the eurozone would grow 1.7% in 2015. In the EU as a whole, it expects 1.4% growth next year and 1.9% in 2015. It said overall EU growth would be flat this year, up from its May forecast, but unemployment would stay at 11.1%. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the subdued forecasts reflected the ""general sluggishness"" of the eurozone economy. ""The norm for the eurozone is still pretty dreadful, really. Even these forecasts are still likely to be too optimistic,"" he said. On an individual country basis, the Commission significantly upgraded its forecasts for the UK from 0.6% to 1.3% for this year and from 1.7% to 2.2% for next year. ""[The year] 2013 has thus far exceeded expectations and the outlook is quite bright,"" the report said on the UK. Recovery 'gradual' ""There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point,"" said Olli Rehn, commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. But Mr Rehn warned unemployment would stay high. ""It is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels,"" he added. The Commission now expects unemployment for the eurozone next year to stay at its current level of 12.2%, up from its previous forecast of 12.1%. It also expects unemployment to improve only gradually, staying around the current level for the next two years and only dropping to 11.8% in 2015. The Commission also warned that it expected the recovery to be gradual. ""While the financial market situation has improved significantly and interest rates have declined for vulnerable countries, this has not yet fed through to the real economy,"" Mr Rehn said. In the eurozone - the 18 member states which use the euro - the Commission predicted growth of 1.1% next year, down from its May forecast of 1.2%, and 1.7% in 2015. The Commission blamed weaker investment and the fact it expected inflation to stay below the central bank target over the next two years. The Commission also expects Greece's recession this year to be slightly less severe than its earlier forecast, predicting a fall in growth of 4% this year, compared with its earlier prediction of a 4.2% fall.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Second footballer comes forward over abuse at Crewe Alexandra,"Steve Walters - who was the club's youngest debutant in 1988 - has spoken to the Guardian newspaper. Ex-Crewe player Andy Woodward has also waived his anonymity about abuse he suffered at the club as a child. Bennell, a coach at the club, was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys. Cheshire Police have confirmed that six people have contacted them since Mr Woodward went public, one of which was Mr Walters. Mr Walters, 44, was not part of the original case against his former coach Bennell, but told the Guardian: ""All these years, I've had this secret inside me. ""But I have to let it all out now. It's the only way. I want closure and I know, for a fact, this is going to help me move on. ""It's been unbearable but, just from reading the article from Andy, it already feels like a massive burden off my shoulders. I have to do this, and I just hope it will help bring more people forward, too."" Crewe chairman John Bowler told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that he was ""infuriated and very disappointed"" with Bennell's previous crimes. Mr Bowler said the club was ""distressed"" by the accusations being made. Mr Bowler, who was chairman at the time of Bennell's offences, was asked about whether more could have been done. He replied: ""When we've done our inquiries and looked at the detail of the various accusations, then I'll be in a position to answer that kind of question."" He added he was ""very sorry for the distress caused"" to both Mr Woodward and Mr Walters. 'Reflect from within' In an earlier statement, Mr Bowler said: ""We are a proud football club and would always take any allegation seriously."" Mr Bowler said the club had needed time to review the situation after Mr Woodward went public last week. ""When things come out of the blue like this, you first want to make inquiries and reflect from within,"" he said. Mr Woodward told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday that he believed his experience was ""the tip of the iceberg"". A spokesman for the NSPCC praised the former Sheffield United and Bury defender for coming forward, adding there was ""more to be done in the world of sport"" to keep children safe. The organisation said: ""It is time for the government and sports organisations to work together to close gaps in child protection and make sure that the thousands of sports clubs across the country have robust safeguarding policies in place."" Sue Ravenlaw, head of equality and safeguarding at the Football Association, also praised Mr Woodward, 43, for his ""immense courage"" in going public with his story.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Saudi blogger Raif Badawi flogging postponed second time,"No reason has been given, but last week Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first flogging. He was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam. His punishment has caused international outcry. Three weeks ago the case was referred to the Supreme Court by the office of then-King Abdullah. The new Saudi King Salman has issued a decree pardoning what are described as ""public right"" prisoners, which could include Mr Badawi. Suad al-Shammary, a rights activist and lawyer who worked with Mr Badawi on his blog, was released on Friday. She had been held for three months without charge over comments she made on Twitter, which her opponents portrayed as anti-Islamic. Health fears Raif Badawi, 30, was due to receive the lashes over a period of 20 weeks. The first round was carried out outside a mosque in Jeddah on 9 January as a crowd watched. Mr Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar - who lives in Canada - told the BBC she was buoyed by Friday's developments. ""I ask the world to remain by my side until Raif is released."" She said she now hated Fridays - the day of lashings. ""I turn into a mess, until I know his [Raif's] fate."" Analysis: Becky Kelly, BBC News The hope Ensaf Haidar clings to week after week does not seem as impossible now as it once did. It's down to a royal decree issued by new Saudi King Salman which announced he would pardon some prisoners. The late King Abdullah did the same. The difference is that Abdullah imposed no conditions, but King Salman's pardons will be implemented by the interior minister. Sources in Saudi Arabia told me that if Raif is one of those prisoners offered a pardon, it will come with conditions he must sign in exchange for freedom. Typically, pardoned activists have had to stop their work and give up their right to free expression. In recent days Saudi officials have approached current prisoners of conscience unofficially inquiring about their thoughts on such potential conditional pardons, the human rights group Amnesty International discovered. On Thursday, Amnesty International said Mr Badawi could suffer ""debilitating long-term physical and mental damage"" if the flogging continues. ""Raif Badawi is a prisoner of conscience, whose only 'crime' was to set up a website for public discussion,"" said Amnesty's Philip Luther. Raif Badawi established Liberal Saudi Network, a now-closed online forum that sought to encourage debate on religious and political matters in 2008. In 2012, he was arrested and charged with ""insulting Islam through electronic channels"" and ""going beyond the realm of obedience"". In 2013 he was cleared of apostasy, which could have carried a death sentence. Saudi Arabia enforces a strict version of Islamic law and does not tolerate political dissent. It has some of the highest social media usage rates in the region, and has cracked down on domestic online criticism.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australia ministers submit new higher education bill,"Senators voted against the higher education reform bill on Tuesday night by 33 votes to 31. The legislation would have cut university funding by 20% and allowed institutions to set their own fees. The reforms are the biggest changes to the sector since the introduction of higher education fees 25 years ago. Ministers say they will now introduce new legislation that will be ""nine tenths of the previous bill"". Students who attend Australian universities are charged higher education (HECs) fees, although government loans and subsidies are in place to relieve the costs for some. The new bill was introduced on Wednesday, but Education Minister Christopher Pyne told a press conference it would not be debated until next year when parliament resumes. Instead of applying the ten year government bond rate to student loans, ministers will now seek to apply an interest rate equal to the nation's inflation rate. The government also wants to establish what it has described as a university transition fund worth about A$100m ($84.6m; Â£54m) and create a new scholarship scheme to support disadvantaged and rural and regional students. New parents will also be given more time to pay back their university fees. Mr Pyne said he was confident the cross benchers would support the new bill, adding: ""We had a defeat this week and I don't think there is any shame in that at all."" He said the Opposition Labor Party's campaign claiming students would struggle to pay back huge debts would ""totally be obliterated"". The government's failure to convince cross bench senators to pass the bill is its biggest failure so far in a tough legislative term, which ends on Thursday. Cross bench senators have also blocked the government's attempts to unwind regulations that critics say potentially exposed consumers to bad financial advice. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie has threatened to vote against all government legislation unless ministers agree to a pay rise for Defence Force personnel that is in line with inflation. David Leyonhjelm, a senator from the Liberal Democratic Party, has also vowed to block legislation if MPs are not allowed to properly debate his same-sex marriage bill. Mr Leyonhjelm last month introduced a bill that would amend the Marriage Act to allow weddings between same-sex couples, transgender and intersex Australians.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sherlock: Praise for 'perfect' series finale,"The Guardian's Lucy Mangan called His Last Vow ""perfect"", praising the series finale for its ""ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence"". Calling it the ""best of the lot"", the Daily Telegraph's Serena Davies singled out writer and producer Steven Moffat. Sunday's final episode drew an average audience of about 8.8 million. That was less than the average of 9.2 million people who tuned in on New Year's Day to see Sherlock's opening episode, the first instalment since in 2012. The second episode, which saw Martin Freeman's John Watson wed his fiancee Mary, saw a slight drop, with an average audience of 8.84 million. The Telegraph's Davies praised Moffat for getting ""the wary dance between plot and character just right"". Her review also saluted Danish actor Lars Mikkelsen for his performance as media mogul and master blackmailer Charles Augustus Magnussen. ""As Magnussen, he licked one of his appalled victims. And in one sequence, excellent in its understatement, he repeatedly flicked Watson in the eye as if his finger were the tongue of a snake,"" she wrote. 'Bromantic lull' ""If he'd chopped him up with a saw it couldn't have been more horrid."" Metro also paid tribute to the former star of The Killing, suggesting the storyline of a manipulative media boss tapped into public fears about phone-tapping and intrusion. ""From his position as a media mogul, he acquires compromising evidence on people, which gives him the power and wealth to gain even more information and therefore influence. ""That's a notion which strikes a chord with modern-day concerns about surveillance and personal data."" ""After the bromantic lull of last week's wedding episode, in which the mystery plot was half-drowned in sentiment, there was reason to fear Sherlock had gone soft,"" said The Independent's Ellen E Jones. ""We should have had more faith."" In a different review on the newspaper's website, however, Neela Debnath called it ""a disappointingly desperate finale"". ""Sherlock is known for being clever, but this time it is trying far too hard and is coming across a tad foolish,"" she wrote. The latest episode was something of a family affair for the production team, featuring Freeman's partner Amanda Abbington as Mary and Cumberbatch's real parents as the parents of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. It also featured Moffat's son Louis in the flashback role of Holmes during childhood. In his review, the Daily Mirror's Josh Wilding said the programme had featured ""some amazing visual sequences, a number of clever twists, a truly detestable villain and a strong story"". Thanks to these, he continued, Sherlock ""continues to show why it is simply one of the greatest TV shows of all time.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pound falls as Theresa May indicates Brexit date,"It also hit its lowest level against the dollar since the beginning of July. On Sunday, the prime minister said she would trigger Article 50, the clause needed to start the process, by the end of March 2017. That means the UK is likely to leave the EU by mid-2019. In early morning trade, the pound fell by about 1% against the euro to â¬1.1433, but it had recovered slightly by late evening. However, the pound was still down almost 1% against the dollar. At one point it touched $1.2818, its lowest rate since 6 July when it hit $1.2797. Volatility Mrs May's announcement had ""unsurprisingly, been bad news for the pound"", said Connor Campbell, Spreadex financial analyst. ""Sterling has been spooked by May's promise to trigger the dreaded Article 50 by the end of March 2017."" However, the currency had been particularly unsettled by the prospect of the UK leaving the EU single market, he said. ""The PM, in a move to appease the more rabid members of the Tory party but one that is set to cause revolt from the backbenchers, has signalled that curbing immigration is the top Brexit priority even if it comes into conflict with Britain remaining in the single market,"" Mr Campbell added. ""Combine all this volatility together and the pound has been left at its worst price since the start of July."" Sixteen-month high While the pound fell, share prices rose. At one point, the FTSE 100 share index was trading at 6,996.43, its highest level for 16 months, before falling back slightly to close 1.2% higher at 6,983.52. ""As a result of Prime Minister May's announcement ... the pound has weakened significantly, which is actually seen as a good thing by the FTSE 100 as it's quite an export-heavy index,"" said Henry Croft, research analyst at Accendo Markets. The FTSE fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, but has subsequently recovered and is up nearly 10%, because listed international-facing firms have benefited from the fall in sterling. After the pound fell sharply at first on Monday, it then recovered some ground after a closely watched survey of the manufacturing sector indicated it grew at the fastest pace for two years in September. But in afternoon trading, it fell against the dollar again after a US survey showed that manufacturing there had also grown strongly.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stonehenge tunnel 'would cause devastation',"Kate Fielden lives near the ancient monument and said the landscape would need to be ""gouged out"" to create the two-mile (3.2km) tunnel along the A303. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps approved the project against the recommendations of planning officials. Janice Hassett of Stonehenge Traffic Action Group welcomed the decision, saying it would reduce congestion. The Planning Inspectorate had recommended Mr Shapps withhold consent, but the Department for Transport said that the benefits of the scheme outweighed the harm. However, many campaigners are worried that the work will have a detrimental impact on Stonehenge, with the tunnel set to be built within a few hundred metres of the world heritage site. Ms Fielden said: ""The landscape to each side of the tunnel will be gouged out into deep cuttings with dual carriageways in them, huge tunnel entrances, masses of concrete, major road interchanges to each side of the World Heritage Site. This is devastation on a major scale."" Tom Holland, from the Stonehenge Alliance, said he was ""stunned"" that the government had decided to give the plan the green light. ""I'm disappointed and I'm very surprised because the independent Planning Inspectorate recommended to the government that this scheme not go ahead. ""Basically, I'm stunned that they have decided to continue with it. This is going to cost not millions, but billions of pounds."" Salisbury MP John Glen said the tunnel was needed, but understood the objections to the project. ""It was never going to please everyone but we have got to move forward and not have continued uncertainty on what is a significant World Heritage Site."" The announcement has been welcomed by Stonehenge Traffic Action Group. ""I'm absolutely ecstatic,"" spokeswoman Janice Hassett said. ""I've only been campaigning seven years, but a lot of people have been waiting 30 years for this. ""We suffer greatly from this rat-run traffic and the only way to fix it is to do something about the A303. It's well over capacity,"" said Ms Hassett. Highways England and English Heritage also support the scheme, which is expected to begin in 2023 and take five years to complete. There is a six-week period in which the transport secretary's decision can be challenged in the High Court.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Night Manager finale beats Queen at 90 by 1m TV viewers,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE NIGHT MANAGER However ITV's documentary, which began an hour earlier, did beat BBC One's Antiques Roadshow, which averaged 4.9m. The Night Manager, an updated version of John Le Carre's 1993 novel, has been a hit with viewers and on social media. The Queen's documentary featured royalty, politicians and celebrities. Reviews have been positive for The Night Manager, starring Tom Hiddleston as the enigmatic Jonathan Pine, who goes undercover to try to expose the activities of billionaire arms dealer Richard Roper, played by Hugh Laurie. The Daily Telegraph called it ""a superb climax"", while pointing out that the ending, in which Roper loses his money and his liberty, differed from the novel's, in which ""Corky survived to expose Pine and thrash him to a pulp for days on end"". Producers told the newspaper they did it to keep viewers ""on their toes"". The Guardian described the series as ""stylish and trenchant espionage drama of, no doubt, award-garnering brilliance"", but the reviewer suggested that Laurie's accent was too similar to one he used 30 years ago in a sketch for A Bit of Fry and Laurie, about about ""two testosterone-charged, Uttoxeter-based health club entrepreneurs"". Tom Hiddleston did his ""best 007 impersonation"", according to the Huffington Post, while the Daily Mirror wrote that the drama gave viewers ""palpitations"" and the Daily Mail said it was ""an explosive mix of gore and subterfuge"". Queen's 'unaffected kindness' Our Queen at 90, while described by the Daily Telegraph as ""too long"", was ITV's Easter showpiece offering for the Easter weekend, and included extensive behind-the-scenes footage of the Royal Family at work and at play. The paper was impressed by interviews with the other members of the family, including the Duchess of Cambridge's revelation that she and the Queen ""bonded on an away day in Leicester"". The Daily Mail said: ""The real triumph of this film, celebrating the Queen not only as a monarch but also as a private person, was its glimpses of her off-duty."" It added: ""The scene that summed up her unaffected kindness and, at the same time, her regal charm was filmed at the Sandringham stables. Her Majesty spoke of every animal as a friend, and knew its quirks.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ikea looks set to open more small stores in the UK,"UK boss Javier Quinones said the London shop was a ""learning experiment"" but its success meant the format was likely to expand to other UK cities. The concept allows people to browse items and discuss home decor plans without visiting out-of-town stores. It is part of Ikea's wider UK expansion after another year of sales growth. The company announced on Friday that UK revenues in the year to 31 August rose by 5.9% to Â£1.96bn. Ikea opened two new large-format stores during the period, in Sheffield and Exeter, taking its UK tally to 21. Online was the standout performer, with 199.3 million visits to Ikea's website, an increase of 13.4%. Website sales grew by 14.4% and now represent 15.5% of total sales. Global trend Ikea has been investing heavily in online, logistics and distribution in a move to cut its home delivery times from one-to-two weeks to three-to-four days. Mr Quinones said this investment was not a reaction to Amazon or any particular retailer but a response to changing consumer demands. He said the small format experiment was part of that change. ""More people are living in cities. In London, fewer people have a car,"" Mr Quinones said. It's part of a global trend, he added, hence Ikea will also trial its small outlets - called Planning Studios - in New York, Shanghai and Riyadh. He could not give details of the small-format expansion in the UK. But he said the existing outlet, in Tottenham Court Road, ""will hopefully be the first of many"". ""Our stores will always be an important part of the Ikea brand when it comes to inspiration,"" Mr Quinones said. ""However, we know that the role of the store is changing. People want to shop in a number of different ways and count on brands to offer them services that reflect the way they live."" Although a large store is due to open at Greenwich, south east London, in spring 2019, plans for another outlet, at Cuerden, Lancashire, were scrapped in May. Ikea said at the time that the site was ""no longer viable"". Brexit Despite Ikea's rise in sales, Mr Quinones said UK retailing was ""a tough economic environment"". ""Consumer confidence has gone down in the last couple of years,"" he said, but pointed out that people still wanted to improve their homes. Ikea posted a 9% increase in home decoration sales, during the year, while sales of living room seating jumped 8%. He said Ikea was working on contingency plans ahead of Brexit, but did not disclose details. ""There is a working group in the UK looking at scenarios,"" he said. Ikea imports the vast bulk of its products, and the fall in the value of the pound over the last couple of year had hit margins. ""We didn't pass on all of the costs,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
US Senate immigration bill starts debate,"The bill has bipartisan support in the Senate but faces a tough fight in the House of Representatives, which is currently negotiating its own bill. Some Republicans criticise the Senate bill's push to provide a 13-year path to citizenship for such immigrants. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid opened debate on Friday, calling the current immigration system ""broken"". ""It is gratifying to see the momentum behind this package of common-sense reforms, which will make our country safer and help 11 million undocumented immigrants get right with the law,"" Mr Reid said. Healthcare issue One of the leading supporters of the bill, Republican Senator John McCain, said he is confident the bill will receive the 60 votes it needs to clear procedural hurdles. ""There are some real concerns about border security that we have to work through, but I'm confident that we will be able to do so,"" Sen McCain said. The bill currently includes $6bn (Â£3.8bn) to strengthen US border security, a key demand of conservatives. Other Republicans say the bill would reward those who broke the law by entering the US illegally. ""We can't reject a dutiful, good person to America and then turn around and allow someone else who came in illegally to benefit from breaking our laws to the disadvantage of the good person,"" said Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading critic of the bill. Sen Sessions also raised eyebrows during the start of debate on Friday by saying ""the federal government has reached a point now where virtually no one is being deported, except those convicted of serious crimes,"" ABC News reports. But US immigration officials deported about 400,000 people in the past year, according to official figures, about half of whom were convicted criminals. Correspondents say many Republicans acknowledge the need to embrace reform, given that Hispanics - an increasingly key voter bloc - overwhelmingly chose Barack Obama in last November's presidential election. In the House, similar legislation is coming up against concerns over the status of taxpayer-subsidised healthcare for undocumented immigrants who aim towards citizenship. Republican Representative Raul Labrador stepped down from a bipartisan group discussing a companion immigration bill in the House, citing the healthcare issue. The Senate bill would bar immigrants in ""provisional"" legal status, the first step - envisaged by the Senate bill - towards permanent residency and citizenship, from receiving taxpayer-subsidised care. Only after 10 years and once applicants receive a green card would they be able to qualify for tax breaks while buying medical insurance under President Obama healthcare reform law. Mr Labrador said the House group, whose negotiations over the issue are not public, have not been able to resolve the healthcare issue.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Auschwitz victim Jane Haining's relatives attend reunion,"The recently discovered document offers fresh insight into the life of Jane Haining from Dunscore. In total some 14 of her relatives attended the event in Edinburgh. One of them, Catriona Topping, said she felt that her connection with Ms Haining had ""deepened"" by holding the will in her hand. Ms Haining died in Auschwitz in 1944 at the age of 47. She is the only Scot to be officially honoured at the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel for giving her life to help protect Jews during the Holocaust. Joyce Greenlees, 59, of Cumbernauld - whose grandfather was Ms Haining's cousin - only learned about family links to Northern Ireland, Belgium and England after reading about the discovery of the will. It was among a number of documents found in attic space at the Church of Scotland's headquarters in Edinburgh. ""I am so proud and pleased to meet members of a family I did not realise existed,"" said Ms Greenlees. ""Jane Haining was a very brave lady who was totally selfless and I think it is very important that everyone knows her story because we can learn lessons from the fact she deeply cared about all people, regardless of religious belief."" Ms Topping, whose late grandmother was Ms Haining's half-sister, said she that the will had helped to transform a ""mystical figure"" from her childhood into a real person. 'Respected everybody' The Bristol University biochemistry PhD student added: ""The lesson we should take from Jane Haining is to be humble and not consider ourselves to be superior to others. ""She did not see herself to be a hero, she was just doing what she thought to be right and respected everybody."" The reception in Edinburgh was hosted by the Moderator of the General Assembly Right Rev Dr Russell Barr who said it was a ""privilege"" to welcome the family of a remarkable woman for afternoon tea. ""Jane's story is one of the most remarkable stories of courage and loyalty,"" he said. ""There was something quite special about seeing her family holding the various photographs and letters and to feel their immense sense of pride in what Jane did and in the ways in which her life and death have now been recognised."" Rob O'Brien, from Ballygally, County Antrim, said he was very proud of his aunt, Ms Haining, and described the reunion as very moving. ""Jane was a person of very deep religious faith and a woman of great resolve and determination,"" he said. ""She had no desire to be a heroine, all she wanted to do was live out her faith and care for children. ""She had love for everybody and I think that is a great example to us all.""

Three-point turn may be dropped from UK driving test,"Under a revised practical exam, learners may also be asked to use a satellite navigation system instead of following road signs. About 1,000 learners will take part in a trial of a new practical exam. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said any eventual changes would be subject to full public consultation. ""We are carrying out initial research to explore how the driving test could better reflect real-life driving,"" said a DVSA spokesman. The DVSA is an agency of the Department for Transport and sets the standards for driving and motorcycling in the UK. The theory test was introduced in 1996 and a section where motorists are asked to find their own way to a destination - aimed at assessing ""independent driving"" - in 2010. Under the other changes being considered, drivers may no longer need to reverse around a corner. The DVSA said drivers may instead be asked to focus on more realistic everyday manoeuvres, such as reversing out of a parking bay, or re-joining the flow of traffic from the side of a road. But reverse parking - either into a parking bay or parallel parking - would remain as one of the manoeuvres candidates could be asked to perform, a spokesman said. The two vehicle-safety questions are currently asked at the start of the test. In future, one these may be asked while the candidate is driving. The DVSA said a candidate, for example, may be asked to show how they would operate the rear heated screen while driving. The driving test The Driving Instructors Association welcomed the plans. Its chief executive Carly Brookfield said: ""DIA has been heavily involved in the scoping of this project and is enthusiastic about the opportunity it presents to evolve the L-test to a level where it more realistically assesses a candidate's ability to competently and safely manage road based risk and driving in real life, on real roads."" RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ""We all rely on our sat navs but they are not infallible and it is when they have led us down a dead end that we need to know how to do a three-point turn. ""It's fine to add some aspects to the test but we should be cautious about removing the basics.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Homeless mental health and drugs services 'broken' in Wales,"By Daniel DaviesBBC Wales, Correspondent Funding is too low to cope with a ""rough sleeping crisis"" in Wales, according to a committee report which also cited a lack of leadership. Charities want ""radical action"", such as providing injecting rooms, after 40% of deaths among rough sleepers were linked to drugs and alcohol. The Welsh Government said it wanted to end rough sleeping. An estimated 347 people were sleeping rough at the last count - a figure based on a ""snapshot"" survey of people living on the streets. Since 2013, 124 rough sleepers are thought to have died in Wales, and last year saw the most deaths so far. In addition, the number of homeless households who are officially deemed to be in priority need of help - not all of whom are on the streets - has been rising. The assembly's equalities committee said there were ""very limited, if any integrated services"" for rough sleepers with mental health or drug and alcohol problems. ""We were told that currently people are having to work around a broken system."" The committee said the Welsh Government should clarify whether the assembly has powers to legalise injecting rooms - safe and supervised places where addicts can take drugs without fear of prosecution. Housing, health and drug services should work together, and people should not lose their support if they miss appointments, the report added 'We couldn't get him sorted so I put him into a bed and breakfast' The housing minister told the committee she put a young homeless man into a bed and breakfast after finding him ""freezing on the side of the road"" in Swansea. Julie James's experience illustrated one of the problems with the system. Recently she was going to the cinema with her family when she met a man who had ""clearly only just arrived"" in the city. She spoke to local housing services, but ""we couldn't get him sorted so I put him into a bed and breakfast"". A separate report commissioned by Ms James calls for new ""assertive outreach teams"" that can respond quickly out of hours when people need accommodation straight away. Equalities committee chairman John Griffiths said: ""There is no question that we are facing a rough sleeping crisis and there is not currently enough money in the system to deliver the significant shift needed to tackle the problem. ""However, it is also clear that there are many structural problems across Wales preventing us from eradicating rough sleeping... There is a role for all public services in tackling the issue."" A Welsh Government spokesman said preventing homelessness was ""everyone's responsibility"" and it would do ""everything in its power to bring homelessness in all its forms to an end. He said they had invested Â£1.3m in new services for people with housing and complex needs, and recognised the importance of the health service working with housing services.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Police 'outnumbered' by Middlesbrough and Newcastle sledging crowds,"Large crowds congregated to frolic on Newcastle's Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough on Wednesday and Thursday. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings but the rules do not apply for crowds consisting of individual households. Cleveland Police said it was ""taking up a lot of resources"". ""You can see we're outnumbered,"" said PC Ritchie Robinson. ""If they're not going to engage with us and we can't explain and reason with them in an amicable manner we're going to have to start taking names and addresses and issuing fines."" Police do have powers to disperse crowds and fine or arrest those refusing to leave, but only if they have a justifiable reason such as disorder or crime. Northumbria Police said officers would ""engage with the public where it is proportionate to do so"". You may also be interested in: A National Police Chiefs Council spokesperson said officers were able to use their discretion but the Home Office determined what sort of crowds were covered by the regulations. The Home Office said people ""should only be leaving home for limited reasons permitted in law and they must follow the rules when they do"". ""The police will continue to take action where necessary, including issuing fixed penalty notices and directing people who are breaching the regulations to return home,"" a spokesperson said. Volunteers who cleaned up litter left behind in Newcastle said Cow Hill was ""an absolute mess"" and warned broken glass had been covered by fresh snow. Northumbria Police said it had dispersed crowds from Town Moor on Thursday night and planned extra patrols to make sure they did not congregate again. The force also said it was aware of footage on social media ""showing a group who appear to be partying on the Town Moor"" on Wednesday evening. ""This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and undermines the efforts of the majority of people in our region who are making daily sacrifices to prevent the spread of coronavirus,"" a spokesperson said. The gathering was reported to police but when officers arrived the group had dispersed. Health chiefs on Tyneside said large numbers of people socialising in close proximity heightened the risk of transmitting coronavirus and warned an increase in patients attending hospital with sledging injuries was putting extra strain on departments at a ""critical time"". ""Burdening our NHS with avoidable injuries at a time when we are already struggling with a pandemic is not acceptable,"" said Bas Sen, director of emergency care at Newcastle Hospitals Foundation Trust. ""The Royal Victoria Infirmary has seen multiple injuries including some pretty major ones, which are terrible for the people concerned but also start consuming critical resources at a time when things are already stretched.""

MPs doubt supermarket scheme to spot carers,"By Rebecca KeatingBBC News Sainsbury's has begun training staff to look for signs that customers may be caring for elderly or disabled people. They are told to give those doing two lots of shopping at once, or collecting two lots of prescriptions, information about services for carers in the area. Minister Paul Burstow said it was one of several ways used to spot carers. Sainsbury's announced last summer that it was working with the Department of Health on its scheme which aimed to identify ""hidden carers"" - those who do not think of themselves as carers, despite looking after someone. 'Real problem' At a committee hearing Labour MP Barbara Keeley said she was ""bemused"" by the scheme. She questioned whether using supermarkets was the best way of identifying others in a similar situation. ""To identify carers through a double shop at Sainsbury's when there is the possibility to direct GPs through their contract to do this... I mean really, are we taking this issue of our commitment to carers seriously at all?"" she said. Her Labour counterpart, Rosie Cooper, described the scheme as a ""nonsense headline-grabbing idea"". ""None of this actually seems to be at the point of making a difference,"" she said. ""If the GP doesn't know there's a carer involved... then it's time to pack it up and go home. ""We're grateful for anything [Sainsbury's] can do but it's at the margins. We need to be dealing with the real problem... and that is helping families, carers and the cared for - it's just mad."" Care Services Minister Paul Burstow said GPs were being used but it was important to use a variety of ways to identify carers. ""What we're not doing is saying there is one magic bullet that allows you to identify all the carers in this country,"" he told the committee. ""It is a contribution to the identification of carers. I think it's wrong to denigrate a supermarket who chooses to act in a socially conscious way."" The Sainsbury's scheme has been trialled in Torbay, where the chain says it resulted in twice as many people signing up to the local carers' register as would normally be expected. The scheme is now being rolled out in some London supermarkets. Carers UK estimates there are 6.4 million carers in the UK, who provide Â£119 billion worth of care each year.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Supreme Court to hear transgender school bathroom case,"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The justices are expected to rule on the case before the end of June. The high court is one justice short after the death of Antonin Scalia, which could lead to a 4-4 decision. Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school. He sued the school board, arguing that they discriminated against him and its bathroom policy violated his civil rights. The US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled in his favour in April. The court deferred to President Barack Obama's directive that Title IX, the federal law which bans sex discrimination in public schools, extends to protect the rights of transgender students to use school bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The Education Department issued that guidance to school districts across the country a month later, sparking backlash and leading 13 states to challenge the directive. Critics say forcing students to use bathrooms consistent with the gender on their birth certificates is necessary for public safety. A Texas federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in August blocking the department's position. Texas judge blocks Obama's transgender bathroom directive A 4-4 Supreme Court ruling would mean the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals decision would remain in place. But it would not set a legal precedent for other school districts across the country. The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on transgender rights. But the justices ruled in favour of a male-born transgender inmate who identified as a woman in 1994. The inmate said she was beaten and raped by another inmate while held with male prisoners.

Family of man shot dead by sheriff's deputy awarded $4 damages,"Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr was shot through his garage door on 14 January 2014 by the deputy in St Lucie County, Florida, in response to a noise complaint. He was found with an unloaded gun, but whether he was holding it is disputed. A jury ruled that no excessive force was used and Mr Hill was responsible for his own death because he was drunk. Gunshots rang out after police were called to Mr Hill's home when a parent collecting her child from a nearby primary school reportedly complained about loud music coming from his garage. According to the New York Times, officers arrived and knocked on the garage door. Mr Hill, a warehouse employee, raised the door only to shut it again after seeing police outside. One of the officers opened fire four times as the door closed, hitting Mr Hill three times, once in the head, reports the newspaper. A judge asked the jury to decide if Mr Hill's constitutional rights had been violated and, if so, whether his family should receive compensation. After hours of deliberation, the jury awarded $1 to his mother for funeral costs and $1 to each of his three children. However, it also decided that Mr Hill was 99% responsible for his own death, meaning the sheriff's department is only required to pay 1% of the damages. This would leave the family with four cents. The judge could reduce the damages further to zero because Mr Hill was intoxicated. 'Hurtful insult' ""It's heartbreaking,"" Mr Hill's fiancÃ©e, Monique Davis, told the New York Times. ""There are a lot of questions I want to ask."" ""I think they were trying to insult the case,"" the family's lawyer, John Phillips, added. ""Why go there with the $1? That was the hurtful part."" The jury found that Christopher Newman, the sheriff's deputy who shot Mr Hill, had not used excessive force. Mr Phillips has set up a page to raise funds for the family and to help cover the cost of the repairs caused by the shooting. It has so far received more than $15,000 in donations. ""Deputy Newman was placed in a very difficult situation,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement after the verdict. ""He made the best decision he could for the safety of his partner, himself, and the public given the circumstances he faced."" Mr Phillips says he is drafting a motion for a new trial, and will file an appeal if the motion is denied.",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Francesca Rhydderch won the fiction prize with The Rice Paper Diaries and Meic Stephens took the creative factual award for Rhys Davies: A Writer's Life. In Welsh, Ioan Kidd won the book prize and people's choice award with his work, Dewis. Literature Wales chief executive Lleucu Siencyn said: ""This is a book-loving town and local support has ensured the success of this evening. ""From Japan to New Quay, Afghanistan to Bristol, Fitzrovia to Blaenclydach the 2014 winners have guided readers to near and distant lands. ""Many congratulations to Meic Stephens, Francesca Rhydderch and, of course, to second time winner Owen Sheers."" Sheers won the book of the year title in 2005 for his work The Dust Diaries. This year's winning book Pink Mist is about three young soldiers from Bristol who are deployed to Afghanistan. The poem looks at the effect of war on the men and those closest to them when they return from service. Sheers told BBC Radio Wales it was a ""fantastic surprise"" to win. ""It's a book that started with around 30 interviews I did with recently wounded service personnel and their families,"" he said. ""I actually did those interviews for a stage project called The Two Worlds of Charlie F, but when that finished I found that I still had so much more that I wanted to say and there were so many stories I hadn't been able to tell on stage, so that's when Pink Mist was born. ""It was Radio 4 that approached me about writing a verse drama - sort of, I suppose, a play for voices if you like - and I asked them if I could go back to this same territory."" The theme of war continued in the fiction category where Rhydderch's winning novel is set both in wartime Hong Kong and in west Wales. Stephens won the creative non-fiction category with the first full biography of one of Wales' most prolific writers, Rhys Davies. In Welsh, Kidd enjoyed a successful night with his novel Dewis, which looks at the trials and tribulations of contemporary family life.

Concern over drivers using social media at the wheel,"By Ben MundyNewsbeat reporter The head of roads policing in England and Wales, Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, says people are increasingly posting updates, taking photos and video calling behind the wheel. More than 6,000 16 to 24-year-olds were killed or seriously injured in 2012. A recent RAC survey also found that 20% of 17 to 19-year-olds admitted using Facebook or Twitter while driving. ""I'm increasingly concerned because young people are absolutely glued to their mobile technology,"" said Chief Constable Suzette Davenport. ""Whether that's social networking or texting, people cannot afford to be doing that when they are driving."" Imogen Cauthery, 27, sustained serious injuries after being hit by a car as a child. Witnesses say the driver was distracted by a mobile phone. Imogen has epilepsy, learning difficulties and memory impairment as a result of the accident. She agreed to tell Newsbeat her story and help with our report on the issue of driver distractions. ""I was on my way to the swimming pool with my mum, sister and best friend Jeannette,"" she said. ""A car came round the corner, on his phone, and I was hit. ""A passing doctor gave me CPR at the scene and I was taken to hospital where they froze my brain. ""I was in a coma for 10 days and much to everyone's surprise I woke. ""It's really upsetting being back here at the scene of the crash. ""This is the place my world turned upside down. ""Some guy fancied taking his licence for granted and he ruined my life."" As part of Imogen's report, she spoke with drivers who admitted using social media while driving. ""If I'm completely honest I would say most people probably do it and I have done in the past - used my smartphone when driving,"" revealed one man who didn't want to give his name. When Imogen asked him why, he replied: ""The thirst for knowledge which has been created by all these forms of media and devices."" James Dawson, 28, also spoke to Imogen. ""I have never done it, but I think a lot of people do,"" he explained. ""You see people looking down at their phone and it's really annoying because it is quite dangerous."" Imogen revisited the park she used to play in with friends as a child. ""I have been unable to do that ever since though because of all my conditions,"" she said. ""My brain is seriously scarred, I take three medications and I had brain surgery again last year. ""I've got really bad memory and that's probably what affects my lifestyle the most - not recognising people can be so humiliating.

West Coast Main Line bid probe 'must be external',"The decision to award the franchise to FirstGroup was scrapped over ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government has since announced a review of what went wrong, but Labour says this should not be carried out by a Department of Transport (DfT) member. The DfT insisted its review is independent. The West Coast route serves 31 million passengers travelling between London, the West Midlands, the north-west of England, North Wales and the central belt of Scotland. FirstGroup had initially beaten current operator Virgin Trains to win the 13-year franchise. But the award was halted after Virgin took legal action over the decision not to renew its contract. The tender will now be rerun. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is expected to explain the U-turn at the House of Commons on Monday. His review of the ""unacceptable mistakes"" by officials during the tendering process will be carried out by Sam Laidlaw, who is the chief executive of Centrica and a non-executive director of the DfT. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said it was not appropriate that the investigation will be carried by a DfT non-executive director. In a letter to the Transport Secretary, she accused ministers of pre-judging the outcome of the inquiry. Ms Eagle wrote: ""Considering the need to look thoroughly at the role of everyone involved in this process, including ministers and senior officials, it is difficult to see how anyone will have confidence in the conclusions reached by fellow members of the departmental board. ""This is not in any way to criticise or pass judgment on those appointed by you to carry out this work, but to ensure the conclusions can be accepted without criticism of the 'inside' nature of the inquiry."" She also criticised what she called ministerial attempts to ""scapegoat"" officials. A DfT spokesman said: ""The independent review into the Intercity West Coast franchise competition will be led by one of the country's most prominent business figures. ""Sam Laidlaw is the lead non-executive on procurement across government and is the person best placed to establish what went wrong rigorously and promptly. ""Mr Laidlaw is using independent external advisers and has been asked to provide an initial report by the end of this month."" A second independent review - on how to take forward the wider rail franchising programme - will be undertaken by the chairman of Eurostar, Richard Brown.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Children need more exercise - especially girls, study says","By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News University College London researchers found just 51% of the 6,500 children they monitored achieved the recommended hour of physical activity each day. For girls, the figure was just 38%, compared with 63% for boys. Half of the group also spent more than six hours being sedentary each day, although some of this would be spent in class, the researchers acknowledged. The study, published in the online journal BMJ Open, found levels of activity varied among groups. For example, children of Indian origin and those living in Northern Ireland were among the least physically active with 43% achieving the recommended levels, compared to 53% in Scotland. 'Worrying' But the most marked difference was between girls and boys. Researchers said this suggested there needed to be a focus on making sport and other activities more attractive to girls. Prof Carol Dezateux, one of the lead authors, said: ""There is a big yawning gap between girls and boys. We need to really think about how we are reaching out to girls. ""The school playground is an important starting point. Often you will find it dominated by boys playing football."" But she said there should still be concern about the activity levels across the board. ""The findings are particularly worrying because seven-year-olds are likely to become less active as they get older, not more."" To achieve the one hour recommendation children have to take part in moderate or vigorous activity, which includes everything from brisk walking and cycling to playing football and running. The UCL research is not the first to suggest children are not active enough, but most previous studies have relied on self-reporting by children or parents estimating levels of exercise, whereas the latest one involved real-time monitoring. During the study, which took place during 2008 and 2009, youngsters wore an accelerometer to measure exercise levels which was attached to an elastic belt around their waist. It was removed only when bathing or when the children went to bed. In total, the experts were able to record more than 36,000 days of data based on the children wearing the accelerometer for at least 10 hours a day over the course of a week. Dr John Middleton, of the Faculty of Public Health, said more research was needed into why certain groups were less active. ""We need our children to grow up to be fit and healthy adults, not just because it's what any civilised society would want for its children, but it's also best for our economy too,"" he added. Dr Ann Hoskins, of Public Health England, agreed. She said: ""This study highlights that there is still much to do to keep children and young people active as they grow older, especially girls. ""The new school year is the perfect time to make healthy changes, swapping short car or bus journeys with walking or scooting to school.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Italy coalition: Thousands rally in Rome against cuts,"Wielding red flags and placards, they urged the centre-left Prime Minister, Enrico Letta, to scrap austerity measures and focus on job creation. Public trust in his fragile coalition with the centre-right is dropping, opinion polls suggest. The country is experiencing its longest recession in more than 40 years. National debt is now about 127% of annual economic output, second only to Greece in the eurozone. Unemployment is at a record high of 11.5% - 38% for the under-25s. Before taking office, Mr Letta vowed to make job creation his priority, but critics are unhappy that he has focused on property tax reform. The issues of social justice and poverty came up when German Chancellor Angela Merkel had talks with the new Pope at the Vatican on Saturday. 'Losing patience' Organised by the metalworkers' union FIOM and the CGIL union, Saturday's peaceful march and rally drew supporters from across the country. ""We ask the government to change [former Prime Minister Mario] Monti's and [former Prime Minister Mario Silvio] Berlusconi's politics,"" said Maurizio Landini, leader of the FIOM. ""If they don't change, as the country asked for with its vote, we are going nowhere."" One of the protesters, Enzo Bernardis, told Reuters news agency: ""We hope that this government will finally start listening to us because we are losing our patience."" Soon after being appointed, Mr Letta met other eurozone leaders to convey growing public unrest over austerity measures in Italy. But the new prime minister has to maintain a delicate balance between the policies of his own supporters and those of the centre-right, led by Mr Berlusconi. Italy's coalition was only formed after two months of post-election deadlock. Merkel visit Among the demonstrators in Rome were radical leftists. A controversial poster depicted Chancellor Merkel, who is seen as typifying austerity, in mock-Nazi uniform. On Thursday, the Pope said in a speech that the global economic crisis had made life worse for millions in rich and poor countries. Speaking after her private meeting with the pontiff, Mrs Merkel told reporters: ""Crises have blown up because the rules of the social market have not been observed... It is true that economies are there to serve people and that has by no means always been the case in recent years."" Mrs Merkel said she and Pope Francis had spoken mainly about globalisation, the European Union and the role of Europe in the world. ""Pope Francis made it clear that we need a strong, fair Europe and I found the message very encouraging,"" she added.

Betsi health board chief criticises 'misleading' Tawel Fan claims,"It made major criticisms but found no evidence of institutional abuse at the now-closed Tawel Fan ward for dementia patients at Glan Clwyd Hospital. Some politicians and some families had claimed a ""whitewash"" and ""cover-up"". But Betsi's chief executive criticised ""misleading"" commentary and coverage. The open letter to AMs and MPs from Gary Doherty gives a point-by-point defence of the report by Health and Social Care Advisory Service Consultancy (Hascas). He said some comments in the coverage were what the health board ""either knows to be untrue or feels to be misleading"". The points include: Tawel Fan timeline On calls for assurances that individual reports to families would not be delayed, the health board said it expects to start the first meetings by the end of the month and that all families would be offered a meeting by the end of July. It also stressed that the second report by Donna Ockenden - still to be completed - was about the structure and systems of elderly care past and present not about care at Tawel Fan ward, which closed in 2013. Analysis by Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent The Hascas report into what happened at Tawel Fan ward was one of the most comprehensive and wide-ranging investigations ever held about standards of care in the Welsh NHS. It took two and a half years and went back to look at the cases of 108 patients. It highlighted many seriously failings in care of elderly patients, not only those at this 17-bed ward but across north Wales. But crucially the investigation contradicted a previous review which found patients at Tawel Fan had been subject to ""institutional abuse"". Hascas's unequivocal conclusion was that did not happen. Instead, the panel gave an account of staff struggling to provide ""good care"" in very difficult circumstances without enough support. It is that finding that some families and some politicians have found very difficult to accept. Ever since it was published some have openly attacked the investigation's integrity and methodology. This letter is an attempt by the boss of the health board, in the strongest possible terms, to defend the investigation and the investigators. In a sense it is a highly unusual plea to politicians.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
TEDGlobal: Burns portrait comes alive at TED,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter, TEDGlobal, Edinburgh The demonstration was part of a session at the TEDGlobal (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference dedicated to makers and DIY-ers. With a nod to the talking portraits at Harry Potter's Hogwarts, Matt Mills - head of innovation at the Cambridge start-up Aurasma - showed the TED audience a picture of the famous Scot. With the app overlaid, the portrait moved and the poet drank from a bottle of whisky. ""Imagine if a mobile phone can see the world in the same way we do,"" Mr Mills said. DIY technology As well as being used in art galleries to bring pictures to life, the app could be used by advertisers, educators and the media, he added. Sharing the stage with Mr Mills were a series of DIY technologists, determined to prove that innovative new products were not just the preserve of large corporations. Biohacker Ellen Jorgensen described the criticism she faced when she set up community biotech lab GenSpace in Brooklyn three years ago. Many felt that she should leave ""science to the scientists"", she said. Dog mess But bio-hackers, as the DIY scientists are known, can offer solutions that the traditional scientists have not found, she said. They can also solve more mundane problems. One of the bio-hackers she worked with used his newly-learned scientific knowledge to track down the dog responsible for fouling his local pavement. ""He identified the dog by throwing tennis balls to all the local dogs and collecting their DNA. Then he confronted the dog owner,"" said Ms Jorgensen. In the same session, Massimo Banzi described the diverse uses, DIY computer enthusiasts have found for his affordable, open-source computer motherboard Arduino. From a man who had used it to create a ""smart"" cat feeder able to recognise each of his cats and give them the correct amount of food, to quadcopters used to transport things from one African village to another, access to a cheap microcontroller was creating a buzz in the maker community, he said. ""It allows people to build something that you can't buy on the market. There is now a turbo-charged DIY community."" Muting Kardashian One of the loudest cheers came for a 14-year-old Brazilian boy who had used Arduino to create an earthquake prediction system ahead of the government. And the biggest laugh went to Matt Richardson who has used the system to create ""Enough already"", a system that mutes the TV when overexposed celebrities talk. ""It is protecting our ears from the details about Kim Kardashian's wedding,"" he said to much TED merriment. Making a more serious point, smart materials DIY-er Catarina Mota explained why it was important to open up new technology to the general public.

France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe,"Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, he was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the pair had a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to ""deepen the European Union"". Both said they would work together more closely on defence, eurozone reform and reducing bureaucracy. Mrs Merkel said the EU depended on France being strong, and that she and Mr Macron had a ""joint conviction that we are not only going to deal with the British exit from the European Union, but we also need to deepen the EU"". She also made her most positive comments yet about eurozone reforms mooted by Mr Macron, saying it may be possible to change EU treaties as would be required to enact them. ""From the German point of view, it's possible to change the treaty if it makes sense,"" she said. ""I would be ready to do this, but first we will work on what we want to reform."" Huge relief and shared desires - BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin There was a warm welcome for the new French president both from Angela Merkel and - unusually - a crowd singing and dancing outside the chancellory. In part that's because Berlin is overwhelmingly relieved that it's not Marine Le Pen walking up the red carpet. But it's also because, in Mr Macron, Angela Merkel has a counterpart with whom she shares a desire to reshape the European Union following Britain's departure. There is a genuine hope here that the French-German relationship, once so fundamental to the European Project, can be rekindled. But some of Mr Macron's ideas about economic reform have raised eyebrows in Berlin - in an election year Angela Merkel won't risk anything which voters might perceive as a German bailout of struggling member states. And, despite the smiles on Monday, Mr Macron has yet to prove himself. Berlin expects him to succeed where others have failed; deliver his election promise and kick start the French economy. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget, parliament and finance minister. He denied being in favour of making all countries that use the euro liable for other individual countries' existing debt. In other developments:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Potholes cost councils Â£1,600 a day in compensation","In total, Â£584,745 was paid out last year to drivers, with the five-year total now passing Â£2.7m. Glasgow City Council had by far the highest amount of payouts, with a total bill of Â£360,000. The statistics were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives through Freedom of Information laws. The party said the figures showed greater spending was needed on Scotland's road network. Local authority umbrella group Cosla said councils were taking action to tackle problem potholes, despite falling budgets. The amounts paid out last year by local authorities, for repairs such as suspension damage and burst tyres, varied considerably. Outside Glasgow, Aberdeenshire was forced to settle Â£34,000 of claims, and the figure in Edinburgh was more than Â£27,000. However, others such as Clackmannanshire and Moray did not have to pay any compensation to drivers. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Alex Johnstone, said: ""The state of roads both in the city and the countryside are a matter of real concern for motorists. ""We need to make sure surfaces are kept in good condition because investment in that would very much reduce the cash paid out in future."" He added: ""Perhaps if the Scottish government took more of a lead in properly investing in our road network and supporting motorists, it would encourage more councils to do the same. ""Only when the overall standard of roads are improved will we see these compensation figures come down."" Cosla development spokesman Stephen Hagan said council officers had been having discussions with a range of organisations to better understand the road maintenance industry and compensation claims. He added: ""Road conditions have improved and councils have spent 20% less in achieving these outcomes in recent years, a tremendous achievement in times of tighter overall budgets."" Roads 'commitment' A Scottish government spokesman said local authorities were responsible for local roads in their area. The spokesman added: ""The Scottish government is providing local government with over Â£10.3bn in 2013-14 to allocate on the basis of local needs and priorities. ""Between 2007-08 and 2012-13 local government's budget increased by 8.9%, demonstrating the strong financial settlements agreed during challenging financial times."" The government spokesman added: ""In terms of Scottish government's responsibilities, we are fully committed to ensuring the trunk road network remains safe, efficient and enables businesses and commuters to engage with each other more effectively. ""That is why we have invested over Â£2.6bn on our roads and motorways since 2007.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
China 'to survey disputed East China Sea islands',"State news agency Xinhua said the survey was part of China's ""programme to safeguard its maritime rights and interests"". The island are called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. The row over the islands, which are controlled by Japan, has left ties between Tokyo and Beijing highly tense. Xinhua said the survey was the second part of a programme to map China's territorial islands and reefs, after the first part was completed in 2009. ""The second stage will cover islands including the Diaoyu Islands,"" the report said, citing the National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation. It did not expand on how and when the survey work would take place. Fighters and ships The row over ownership of the islands, which lie south of Okinawa and north of Taiwan, has been rumbling for years. It reignited in September when the Japanese government purchased three of the islands from their private Japanese owner, leading to protests in some Chinese cities and fall-out for some Japanese businesses operating in China. Chinese government ships have since sailed many times through what Japan says are its territorial waters around the islands. Late last year, a Chinese government plane also overflew the islands in what Japan called a violation of its airspace. Japanese fighters have been scrambled on a number of occasions since then. New Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was elected in December, has pledged a tough stance. He says the issue of ownership is not up for negotiation but has also called for more dialogue with Beijing. Last week it was announced that Japan planned to increase military spending for the first time in a decade - albeit by a small amount - in a move that has been linked to the row with China. Japan also appears to be looking to reinforce its capabilities in the area - public broadcaster NHK reported on Monday that two more patrol ships will be deployed to the area later in the year. Kyodo News agency, citing unidentified government sources, said on Tuesday that defence officials were looking into basing fighter jets closer to the disputed island chain, utilising a runway on a small island south of Okinawa. The top US East Asia diplomat, Kurt Campbell, is due in Japan later in the week for talks expected to include the territorial row, on which Washington has urged both sides to exercise caution. Former Japanese leader Yukio Hatoyama is also in Beijing on a private visit. Mr Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party is now in opposition after December's election, has in the past called for Japan to improve its ties with Beijing in a rebalancing of traditional alliances. Local media report he is seeking talks with Chinese leaders.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
First peek at Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play,"By Amelia ButterlyNewsbeat reporter Published on Pottermore, JK Rowling's Harry Potter website, the images show a young boy in a nest with wings. The play, split over two parts, is designed to be seen either on the same night, or over consecutive evenings. Producers have announced it is going to be a sequel to Rowling's books, focusing on Harry's son Albus Severus. ""While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted,"" a synopsis reads. ""As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places."" Previews will start in June 2016, at the Palace Theatre in London. Early performances will have some cheap tickets on sale for just Â£10 per part, rising to Â£15 for the official run. Pictures of artwork with the tagline, ""The eighth story. Nineteen years later,"" have also appeared online. Harry Potter fans have suggested the nest and wings in the picture are reminiscent of a Golden Snitch, the smallest ball used in a game of Quidditch. JK Rowling tweeted to say she ""loved"" the official picture. The final Harry Potter book ends with an epilogue - set 19 years after the main plot concludes - featuring Harry and his now-wife Ginny seeing their son off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Previously Rowling has refused to give away many details about the plot of the play, saying she did not ""want to say too much more, because I don't want to spoil what I know will be a real treat for fans"". She added: ""To answer one inevitable (and reasonable!) question - why isn't Cursed Child a new novel? ""I am confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it was the only proper medium for the story."" A new film starring Eddie Redmayne - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - based on a screenplay written by Rowling, is expected in 2016.

'Scrap ban' on term-time holidays,"By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter Since September last year, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take children out of school for unauthorised absences. But the Local Government Association says the new rules do not recognise the complexities of family life. A Department for Education spokeswoman said heads still had flexibility. Until last September, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in ""special circumstances"". But now head teachers can grant absence outside school holidays only in ""exceptional circumstances"". And local authorities are obliged to instigate fines and enforce legal proceedings on behalf of schools. This means parents who take children out of school during term-time, often to avoid very high holiday costs, can receive automatic penalty notices of Â£60 per child. This rises to Â£120 if not paid within 21 days. Parents who fail to pay could face prosecution and a maximum fine of Â£2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The LGA said that while councils fully supported the Department for Education's stance that every child should be in school every day, there were occasions when circumstances should be given individual consideration. These might include religious festivals, weddings, funerals or even once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. 'Black and white' David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board, said: ""Ensuring every child has a good school attendance is of paramount concern for everyone working with children. ""However, common sense must prevail in cases when mums and dads ask to take their child out of school during term-time if there is a legitimate reason. ""An outright ban is too simplistic and doesn't recognise that family life and circumstances aren't always so black and white. He added that head teachers knew families' circumstances and ""should be trusted to make decisions without being forced to issue fines and start prosecutions"". But a spokeswoman for the Department for Education said that heads had the option of allowing time off if necessary. ""We have been clear that all head teachers are free to grant pupils leave in exceptional circumstances. ""It is up to them to decide whether to grant time off, and how much to grant. This appears to be exactly what the LGA is calling for."" 'Little option' Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ""The problem lies with the holiday companies and airlines and if this issue is to be addressed sensibly then there should be pressure put on them, not schools. ""Many teachers are parents and we entirely sympathise with the dilemma caused by price hikes for breaks during the school holidays. ""In particular, at this time of pressure on pay, our sympathies are with those on low pay who have little option but to take the cheapest holiday they can find. ""It remains the case that pupils can be granted time off in exceptional circumstances.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wife 'stunned' by wedding ring find,"Paul Higson had been scared to tell his wife Jan he had lost the ring and it took him two months to confess. He works all over the Orkney mainland and the ring could have been anywhere. The pair had given up all hope of finding the lost ring until Jan looked down and saw a sparkling object under a stone on the Sands of Wright beach. Mrs Higson, a 49-year-old who works in a primary school, told BBC Scotland: ""We walk the dogs at various beaches and Paul works at various places on Orkney mainland so we had just given up. ""We thought that was it."" However, on a walk at the Sands of Wright on South Ronaldsay Jan realised she had forgotten to bring poo bags for their dogs, Buddy and Rafn. Paul went back to the car to collect them. Jan said: ""I stood there with two dogs and just looked down and saw something metallic in the stones. ""I originally thought it was a washer or something like that but I bent down and moved one of the stones because it was wedged under one of the stones and pulled it out and it was Paul's wedding ring."" Mr Higson, 60, who is an environmental consultant, keen birdwatcher and beachcomber, said he had no idea how or when he lost the ring. When his wife told him she had found it he could hardly believe it. He said: ""I was quite stunned, to be honest, because I thought Jan was joking. ""She showed me the ring and it just fitted straight back on my finger again."" Paul said he had worn the ring for 25 years and knew straight away it was his. He said: ""When you've worn it as long as I have you just know. It fitted perfectly. It was the ring."" He added: ""For Jan to just to look down and see it was a million-to-one chance really."" Jan said she put the news of the chance find on Facebook and family and friends were ""absolutely stunned"".

Commons could close early due to coronavirus,"Jacob Rees-Mogg said the option to close early was being considered but added that emergency legislation needed to be approved first. MPs will see other changes to the way the House of Commons runs, including a ban on alcohol sales. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle also said voting would take longer to allow for social distancing. Addressing MPs Sir Lindsay said votes would now take up to 40 minutes, rather than the customary 15 to ensure MPs kept a safe distance from each other. The question of closing the House of Commons early was raised by SNP MP Patrick Grady who said: ""The continuing business of the House continues to put pressure on staff, pressure on members. ""Can the leader say what consideration is being given to bring recess forward to the end of this week because the reality is that any of us that return to our constituencies from London, the epicentre of the virus, are going to have to self-isolate?"" In response, the Leader of the House, Mr Rees-Mogg, said: ""I can assure the honourable gentleman that that is being considered."" MPs are considering the Coronavirus Bill which gives the government new emergency powers to combat the spread of the disease. Mr Rees-Mogg said that the bill needed to pass this week - however, he suggested other bills, such as the Toilets Rate Relief Bill, could be postponed until after the Easter break. The House of Commons had been due to break for Easter on 31 March. Alcohol ban Before debate began on the Coronavirus Bill, Sir Lindsay announced changes to how the House of Commons would operate following the continued spread of the virus. In addition to suspending alcohol sales in House of Commons catering venues, some canteen facilities will be closed. He also said over the Easter recess, work would take place to make video conferencing easier. And on voting, he said the entry of MPs into the division lobbies - where members cast their votes - would be staggered to allow for social distancing. Sir Lindsay also encouraged MPs to ""think twice"" before tabling questions to ministers warning that too many inquiries could ""block up"" civil servants working on the coronavirus.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
VW US sales rise despite scandal,"On Monday US regulators said an extra 800,000 cars had been identified as using devices that concealed emission levels during testing. The carmaker sold 30,387 cars in October, a rise of 0.24% compared with the same month last year. In a statement VW thanked its customers for ""their patience and loyalty"". ""Volkswagen is committed to making things right and actively working to restore trust,"" said Volkswagen America's chief operating officer Mark McNabb. Sales of the company's Golf line increased 40.2% compared to October last year. The Jetta and the Beetle, though, both took hits with sales decreasing 41.5% and 34.1% respectively. Other US car companies reported double digit gains. GM rose 16% and sales of Ford rose 13% in October. Volkswagen sales have been down throughout the year, mostly driven by its poor performance in the sale of larger cars and trucks that are popular in the US. Year to date sales are down 2.19%. In September the company stopped selling six diesel car models after US regulators uncovered software code designed to cheat emissions tests. The affected models were: â¢VW Jetta TDI (Model Years 2009 - 2015) â¢VW Jetta SportWagen TDI (Model Years 2009-2014) â¢VW Golf TDI (Model Years 2010-2015) â¢VW Golf SportWagen TDI (Model Year 2015) â¢VW Beetle TDI and VW Beetle Convertible TDI (Model Years 2012 - 2015) â¢VW Passat TDI (Model Years 2012-2015) Sales of the Touareg TDI - one of the few diesel cars Volkswagen was not ordered to stop selling - stood at 416 vehicles. Volkswagen has replaced its chief executive and apologised to customers. However, a new report from environmental regulators on Monday suggested the company used the emission-concealing software in more vehicles than previously uncovered. ""It's the intentional deceit that bothers consumers and Volkswagen hasn't laid out its plan for how it is going to fix this. They need to lay out a plan before they can begin to turn the corner,"" said Michelle Krebs senior analyst for AutoTrader.com. Industry growth Cheap fuel prices and the low cost of borrowing helped other US carmakers boost sales throughout the year. Purchases of GM cars have been up for 24 months in a row. Sport utility vehicles and trucks were a major driver of this trend. October's increases have mostly been attributed to sales of Chevrolets, which were up 18% from last year. Similarly Ford, which sold 213,938 vehicles in October, had a 12% increase in sales of its SUVs compared with 2014. The demand for larger cars in the US was hurting VW even before the scandal. ""VW has been down for a couple years because they haven't had the right vehicles at the right price, at the right time. The market is screaming for sport utility vehicles and VW isn't dominating in that,"" said Ms Krebs.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Women still do more household chores than men, ONS finds","The Office for National Statistics said that, when it came to unpaid chores at home, women were doing almost 40% more than men on average. Men averaged 16 hours a week helping out at home compared with 26 by women, with those on maternity leave doing the most. The area men do more in is transport, such as driving family members around. The figures come from ONS analysis of research from two different sources on how people use their time at home. In the report, the ONS defined unpaid work as work which households do themselves but could pay someone else to do for them. Women aged 26 to 35 did the most unpaid work, at 34 hours a week, while women on maternity leave averaged as much as 60 hours a week based on 2015 figures. In 2015, full-time students did 12 hours of unpaid work a week on average, while the ONS found that people over the age of 56 did the most cooking and laundry. The ONS calculated that women would earn Â£259 a week on average if this unpaid work was remunerated, while men's efforts would earn Â£166 a week on average. The statistics also revealed that the average amount of time parents devoted to childcare had fallen slightly since 2000, while increasing for the over-60s. The research sources were statistical bulletins Household satellite account: 2005 to 2014 and Changes in the value and division of unpaid care work in the UK: 2000 to 2015. Eleanor Taylor, a researcher at Natcen which conducts the British Social Attitudes survey, said the ONS findings were ""no surprise"". She said despite declining support for traditional gender divisions of labour over the past 30 years, substantial support remains for women having the primary caring role for young children. Oriel Sullivan, professor of sociology of gender at Oxford University said three barriers were halting the shift in the balance of roles in the home. Gender ideology, government policy and the workplace all had to be reconsidered to make provisions so it was easier for men to be at home and do their fair share, Prof Sullivan said. The findings follow other recent research into the division of labour in the home. In March, an Oxfam poll concluded UK women living with their partners spent an average of two working days a month more than men on housework and childcare. Two Oxford University academics, in August, found that women do 74 minutes more housework a day than men after analysing 50 years of data.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Ex-soldier self-isolating on 'uninhabited' Hildasay,"Chris Lewis has walked 12,000 miles after setting off from near his home in Swansea in August 2017. He has now been given special permission to live in the one house on Hildasay, Shetland, with his dog Jet. The 108-hectare island sits off the west coast of the Shetland mainland. The 39-year-old was sleeping in a tent on mainland Shetland when lockdown restrictions were imposed on 23 March to limit the spread of coronavirus. 'Kindly given a boat' However, he and Jet were taken to Hildasay by boat and have remained there ever since. Their new home is a former shepherd's hut without running water, heating or electricity. He was offered the keys by the family of the man who owns it after they heard he was camping. After lockdown restrictions are lifted, Mr Lewis and Jet will continue their journey around the UK coastline to raise money for SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity - with donations already reaching almost Â£98,000. ""I've mainly been in isolation for the past two years due to the nature of the places we've been walking,"" he said. ""When I heard there was going to be a lockdown, I was kindly given a boat to get over to Hildasay, which is an uninhabited island. ""I thought it would be better if I wasn't on the mainland - I didn't want to be in the way."" 'Happiest I've ever been' Since then, Mr Lewis has survived thanks to a regular boat drop bringing fresh water and coal. He said he collects driftwood, forages and fishes for his food, and always makes sure he has a three-week supply of dog food for Jet. Hildasay has been uninhabited since the late 19th Century, with Mr Lewis and Jet joined only by 15 sheep and thousands of birds. ""It has really given me a chance to enjoy the island,"" he said. ""I'm able to reflect on the walk so far, just realising what this has done to help me personally and the amount of amazing people there are in the UK. ""I'm the happiest I've ever been."" Almost 40,000 people have been following Mr Lewis's journey on a Facebook page, Chris Walks the UK. Mr Lewis said he struggled to cope with life on ""civvy street"" after leaving the Parachute Regiment and finding himself homeless. He slept on the street and in cars before SSAFA, which he describes as ""truly amazing"", stepped in to help. He set off from Llangennith beach on the Gower Peninsula with just Â£10 in his pocket and a few days of supplies to raise money for the charity. When he is able to resume his fundraising challenge, Mr Lewis will make his way to the north of Scotland before heading down the east coast of the UK.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Putin's Stasi spy ID pass found in Germany,"The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass was found during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi. Mr Putin, then a KGB major, got it in 1985. It got him into Stasi facilities, but he may not have spied for them. In a statement on Tuesday, the Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin ""received the pass so that he could carry out his KGB work in co-operation with the Stasi"". Stasi was actually the nickname for East German Ministry of State Security (MfS) agents. It was notorious for its meticulous surveillance of ordinary citizens, many of whom were pressed into spying on each other. ""Current research gives no indication that Vladimir Putin worked for the MfS,"" the BStU statement said. Mr Putin, born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), was posted to East Germany in 1985, aged 33. His two daughters were born during that posting. He is now 66. Mr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden up to and including December 1989, when the communist East German regime collapsed amid mass pro-democracy protests. His Stasi pass was renewed every three months, as shown by the stamps on it. It is not clear why he left the pass in the Stasi files in Dresden. He witnessed protesters occupying the Dresden Stasi headquarters, while communist security forces came close to opening fire on them, on 5 December 1989. Jubilant East Berliners had already breached the Berlin Wall in November. Mr Putin was fluent in German at the time and has said he personally calmed the Dresden crowd when they surrounded the KGB building there, warning them that it was Soviet territory. During his KGB service in Dresden Mr Putin was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1989 he was awarded a bronze medal by communist East Germany - officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - ""for faithful service to the National People's Army"", the Kremlin website says. After returning to Russia, Mr Putin rose to become head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - main successor to the KGB. He became Russian president in 2000. In June 2017 Mr Putin revealed that his work in the KGB had involved ""illegal intelligence-gathering"". Speaking on Russian state TV, he said KGB spies were people with ""special qualities, special convictions and a special type of character"". A once top secret agreement between the KGB and Stasi, seen by the BBC, shows that the KGB had 30 liaison officers in East Germany who worked directly alongside the Stasi. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged off the emergence of Mr Putin's old Stasi card. ""The KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies so you probably can't rule out an exchange of such identity cards,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Trump tariffs: President says EU makes business 'impossible',"Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish PM at the White House, Mr Trump said other countries had ""taken advantage of"" the US for decades. Shortly afterwards it was announced that White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who opposes tariffs, would quit. The EU has drawn up a $3.5bn (Â£2.5bn) hit list of retaliatory tariffs. Motorbikes, whiskey and T-shirts are on the bloc's list of 100 American products, the BBC understands. The US president's proposed global duties on steel and aluminium have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat trade war. ""The European Union has been particularly tough on the United States,"" Mr Trump said at Tuesday's joint press conference with the Swedish prime minister. ""They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them,"" Mr Trump complained. Mr Trump said if the EU retaliated, the US would impose a 25% tax on European cars. But the US president also said America would levy tariffs in a ""loving, loving way"". ""They'll like us better and they'll respect us more,"" he said about US trade partners who object to the plan. Mr Trump repeated his belief that the US would win any trade war, since it was running such a large trade deficit. ""When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad,"" he told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's decision to raise import taxes on steel to 25% and aluminium to 10% prompted strong reactions around the world last week. Swedish PM Stefan Lofven said: ""I am convinced that increased tariffs will hurt us all in the long run."" Mr Lofven is the first European leader to visit the White House since the tariffs were announced last week. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party have voicing disquiet at his proposal. Just before Mr Trump spoke, Senate leader Mitch McConnell said: ""There is a lot of concern among Republican senators that this could sort of metastasise into sort of a larger trade war."" Earlier on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the tariffs were too broad. He urged Mr Trump ""to be more surgical"" when selecting which countries to target ""so we do not have unintended consequences"". Congressman Mark Meadows, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, said most lawmakers had told him they did not support the president's decision. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country was planning its own tariffs on US goods. He said they would issue them in a way that is most politically damaging to Mr Trump. ""We would have to target our response at the things they export that are most politically sensitive and hit exactly those goods,"" he told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

Sir Terry Matthews: Wales lacks IT commerce skills,"The industrialist, who made his fortune in hi-tech firms, is to address a conference in Newport on how businesses can use IT to boost profits. He said: ""We don't lack people who are innovative. What we lack is turning that into a commercial operation."" Sir Terry thinks Wales could add Â£1.5bn to its IT sector value over five years. He will be a keynote speaker at the Digital 2013 conference at his Celtic Manor Resort on Tuesday. More than 1,200 business and individual delegates were expected to attend the two-day event, which began on Monday. Sir Terry, Wales' first billionaire, last year launched his own mentoring scheme, the Alacrity Foundation, for young entrepreneurs in the hi-tech sector. He has also urged business leaders in Wales to pass on their experience to new graduates, to give them skills for dealing with the business world. The conference's literature claims businesses could bring a further Â£1.5bn into the Welsh economy over five years if they make the most of advances in digital technology. It said ""effective utilisation of digital technologies has never been as important for enterprise, jobs, and growth"". Cash call Speaking ahead of his address, Sir Terry said his foundation had five teams of young graduates working on new technology ideas. He said: ""Our hope is that, with guidance, they will end up having very significant technology companies and employ a lot of people. ""We don't lack well-educated people and we don't lack people who are innovative. What we lack is the commercialisation. ""As an example, where's the venture capital? ""My sort of thing here is, if you can tease people with a little cash and people with a lots of experience into being mentors or board members and better still investors, then you get a lot of support [for entrepreneurs].""

"Wales council mergers: Cost could be Â£200m, says WLGA","The Williams Commission proposes merging local authorities to reduce numbers from 22 to between 10 and 12. WLGA chief executive Steve Thomas said there was no evidence the last council reorganisation created major savings. But the commission estimates this latest shake-up could save Â£60m to Â£80m per year after an upfront Â£100m cost. Commission chair Sir Paul Williams has said council mergers using existing boundaries should be under discussion by Easter. It would be the first council reorganisation in Wales in nearly two decades. Mr Thomas said: ""How are we going to pay for this? There are quite a lot of upfront costs. The work that we've done suggests something like Â£200m. ""Do we want to spend that Â£200m on reorganisation or do we want to spend it on services?"" In 1996, the current system of 22 unitary authorities was created out of eight counties and 37 districts which were in turn formed in 1974. Mr Thomas said his experience of the 1996 boundaries shake-up was that there had been no report detailing the savings it led to. ""I was involved in the 1990s reorganisation and I can't find a definitive figure from that reorganisation to suggest that there were huge savings,"" he said. ""There may well have been but nobody's done a definitive piece of work on that."" The WLGA has said research it commissioned by accountants Deloitte suggested reorganising councils in Wales could also cut 15,000 jobs. The Williams Commission estimates that much of the Â£100m cost of reorganisation would be in redundancy payouts. The current single unitary authorities were created with the aim of being more efficient by cutting out a layer of bureaucracy and making it simpler for people to understand who was providing their public services. Proponents of change argue that many of the 22 councils are too small to deal with areas such as education and social services, although it is not just the smaller authorities that have been criticised for the quality of their services in these two areas. 'Voting reform' Electoral Reform Society Cymru said it had warned the Welsh government not to rush into making changes because local democracy could suffer. Director Steve Brooks said: ""Larger councils could make voters feel more disconnected and less able to influence decisions which affect their everyday lives. ""Evidence from Europe suggests that this can undermine the public's confidence in local government and its ability to respond to local needs. ""Without voting reform, there's an added danger that these larger councils will become one-party states, which will only further compound councils' governance problems.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

John Boehner survives House rebellion in US Congress,"Mr Boehner survived a challenge from the party's more conservative wing, with 25 Republicans voting against him. At the top of the Republican agenda is approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was the first bill introduced. The party won a majority in the Senate during November's mid-term election. Republicans already controlled the House of Representatives. They have been angered by recent unilateral actions by Mr Obama including an executive action on immigration policy and a major shift in US policy on Cuba. Both chambers convened at midday, as required by the US constitution, after an early morning storm that left the capital city covered in snow. At the scene: Suzanne Kianpour, BBC News The US Capitol was buzzing with the excitement of the ""first day of school."" Inside the Senate chamber, there was an air of camaraderie - a rare feeling in polarised, partisan Washington. ""Enjoy the ceremonies,"" Mitch McConnell said in his first speech as Senate Majority leader. ""Tomorrow we get to work."" At the mock swearing-in and photo-op with the vice-president and senators' families in the old chamber - the original home of upper house legislation and debate until the late 1800s - Vice-President Joe Biden was his usual joking self. When it was the turn of Lindsey Graham, a staunch Obama critic, Mr Biden quipped: ""I'm not doing the next one."" ""Hard work awaits,"" said the new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. ""I'm really optimistic about what we can accomplish."" During prepared remarks on Tuesday, Mr Boehner said he wanted Mr Obama to work with Republicans on bills that have stalled in recent years. But he also criticised unnamed fellow representatives for ""shadow boxing and show business"". The first bill to be introduced was the approval for Keystone XL, a controversial oil pipeline extension on hold for years. It may have enough support to pass a procedural hurdle in the Senate but on Tuesday, the White House has said Mr Obama would veto the legislation if it came to his desk. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the legislation undermined a ""well-established"" review process and did not take into account a lawsuit still pending in the state of Nebraska over the pipeline's route. The US president has used his power of veto twice in his six years as president, but has said he expects to use it more now that both chambers are controlled by Republicans. Republicans are also set to take on Mr Obama's immigration policy changes through a funding fight, legislation to repeal or defund the health law often referred to as ""Obamacare"", and fast-track a Pacific trade deal. Despite the likelihood of high-profile clashes, Republican leaders and the White House have signalled there might be co-operation on such trade deals, as well as tax reform and infrastructure spending. Mr Obama could face pressure on the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a 12-nation trade deal that liberals like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders say benefits corporations at the expense of American workers.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Mayor hopes Treasury will hop on board travel plans,"Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London@BBCTomEdwardson Twitter Today the mayor is in Northern Ireland showing off the new chassis production line for the 'New Bus for London', a modern design based on the old Routemaster which has prototypes running on two routes. He's using it to show that investment in London's transport supports jobs across the UK. Why? Discussions are now going on between the Treasury and Transport for London (TfL) about next year's spending settlement. TfL wants sustained investment over five years of Â£1.8bn a year. This is a rather odd cycle. London jobs Most of the time, parts of TfL boast about punctuality times improving along with customer satisfaction. Then, as soon as the funding review rears its head, it'll happily show you some of the most outdated and crumbling infrastructure you are ever likely to see, to prove it needs more money. The argument being made now is about the supply chain and how investment in London's transport maintains jobs. This is a breakdown of the five biggest procurements that TfL has given me: It also says: ""Investment in London's transport network supports 40,000 jobs in the UK supply chain, with a further 19,000 supported in the supply chain within London. "" Of course not every procurement from TfL is from the UK - some of the mayor's flagship projects aren't. The bike hire scheme comes from Canada and TfL says that cost Â£100m to set up. The cable car (Â£45m) over the Thames comes from Austria. The jobs argument is being made along with the infrastructure argument - that building in London creates construction jobs here. Without Â£1.8bn a year, TfL says it will have to cut or mothball the Piccadilly line upgrades, new Jubilee line trains and road schemes. That will have a direct impact on hundreds of thousands of Londoners. City Hall also wants to make it clear transport investments aren't just about transport, they are also about how transport cash can unlock and regenerate whole areas with housing. TfL savings Nonetheless, efficiency savings at TfL will still be big. TfL says: ""In terms of savings we have already secured Â£9.8bn in savings (which will be delivered by 2017/18) and we have committed to saving a further Â£5bn by 2021/22."" Here are some savings made so far: It's difficult to see how that won't include job losses and with those large efficiencies there will be more emphasis on TfL to make money commercially. That'll mean optimising advertising spaces, more office developments and station retail developments. The view from the mayor's critics is that he paid a premium on too many schemes - like the new bus - and hasn't offered value for money. The Lib Dems on the London Assembly point to the fact that in the mayor's 2012 transport manifesto he said the new bus would ""not cost more than an existing hybrid bus"". In fact, each one will cost Â£50,000 more. The big question is will that affect the view from the Treasury?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, 'not caused by the XMRV virus', say researchers","By Helen BriggsHealth reporter, BBC News US scientists linked the condition, also known as ME, to a mouse-like virus in 2009 after finding it in blood samples. Now, UK experts say the discovery was a ""false positive"", caused by cross contamination in the lab. The illness may still be caused by a virus, they say, but not the one at the centre of recent controversy. ""Our conclusion is quite simple: XMRV is not the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome,"" said Professor Greg Towers, a Wellcome Trust senior research fellow at University College, London, who led the research. ""It is vital to understand that we are not saying chronic fatigue syndrome does not have a virus cause - we cannot answer that yet - but we know it is not this virus causing it."" Mouse DNA XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) is a virus found in mouse DNA. It was discovered in 2006, and was later found in samples from some patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome. This lead to suggestions that the virus might be the cause of these conditions. A paper providing some evidence in support of a link between chronic fatigue syndrome and the virus was published in the leading journal Science last year. In the latest work, the team, from London and the University of Oxford, used DNA sequencing methods to study XMRV. They say their evidence, published in the journal Retrovirology, shows the virus found in patient samples arose from laboratory contamination. What is more, they think it is unlikely that the virus could actually infect people. Professor Tim Peto, consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, said the original paper in Science came as a great surprise to experts. ""There have now been a number of attempts which have failed to find the retrovirus in other samples, and this research suggests that in fact XMRV is probably a contamination from mouse DNA,"" he said. ""These latest findings add to the evidence and it now seems really very, very unlikely that XMRV is linked to chronic fatigue syndrome."" But the authors of the original research say they stand by their conclusions. ""Nothing that has been published to date refutes our data,"" Dr Judy Mikovits, of the Whittemore Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease, said in a statement. Dr Charles Shepherd, medical advisor for the ME Association, said patients should keep an open mind on the issue. ""The jury is still out,"" he said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Netflix removes Dave Chappelle's show after comedian's complaint,"Chappelle's Show first aired on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2006. But in excerpt from a recent stand-up gig that he posted on Instagram, he claimed he ""never got paid"" royalties after the show's original run. He castigated Comedy Central's parent company ViacomCBS for continuing to make the show available on HBO Max. ""People think I made a lot of money from Chappelle's Show,"" the 47-year-old said in his routine. ""When I left that show I never got paid."" He claimed he was ""desperate"" when he signed his original contract, and that its terms mean ViacomCBS and other parties can rebroadcast Chappelle's Show without being obliged to pay him. ""I found out that these people were streaming my work and they never had to ask me or they never have to tell me,"" he said. ""Perfectly legal because I signed the contract."" Chappelle recently referenced the matter while hosting the weekly comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). On that show, the comedian joked that his great-grandfather William Chappelle, who was born in slavery in 1857, would have thought his descendent had been ""bought and sold"" more than he had been. Netflix, HBO Max and ViacomCBS have yet to comment. In the video he posted on Tuesday under the title Unforgiven, Chappelle alleged that Netflix and HBO Max had decided to stream the series after his SNL hosting role was announced. ""The day I committed to [SNL], it gets announced that Netflix is streaming Chappelle's Show,"" he is seen saying. ""Not just Netflix; HBO Max is streaming it too."" 'Above and beyond' Chappelle said the news made him ""furious"", and that he had called Netflix to tell them ""this makes me feel bad"". ""And you want to know what they did?"" he continued. ""They agreed they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better."" The comic went on to praise the streaming service for going ""above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman"". He said: ""They did something just because they thought that I might think that they were wrong."" Chappelle signed a multi-million dollar deal with Netflix in 2016 to make a series of stand-up comedy specials. In the video, the comedian also called on ViacomCBS's shareholders to ""tell them it's wrong"" to allow Chappelle's Show to be streamed on outlets it owns.

Boris Johnson: Intelligence questions raise trust issue again,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter The questions that many of his colleagues aren't quite sure about. And of course, the question that the front runner to become prime minister in a few weeks answers heartily, yes of course. But when it comes to the most sensitive matters of state, maybe it is not quite so straightforward. There were issues about the sharing of intelligence with Boris Johnson when was foreign secretary, particularly in his first few months in the job, sources have told the BBC It is understood that Theresa May and some in the intelligence community had worries about his ability to keep information confidential. And the tension went back as far as the time when he was Mayor of London and she was home secretary, when one source claims he angered her by inadvertently revealing confidential information before it was due to be made public. Once he was in government, on occasion Downing Street would even convene smaller meetings, or ""pre-meets"", to discuss sensitive subjects rather than include him as foreign secretary, a senior figure has told me. You can read my colleague Gordon Corera's full story on what happened here. Mr Johnson's campaign team denies there was ever a problem while Mr Johnson himself has said it is ""not true"" that anything was withheld. But one of his allies confides ""it was obvious there were concerns on issues from early on"" and suggests ""there was a constant question of whether he was really seeing everything"" - the full intelligence picture that he would be entitled to in his role as Foreign Secretary. It's said that he worried constantly about being cut out. But, this is not just about the keeping of secrets, but Theresa May's desire to keep political control. It's suggested that the real issue was a lack of trust and hostility between Mr Johnson and Theresa May. One source believes Mr Johnson was excluded from seeing some sensitive information because there was a hostile relationship between him and Downing Street, not because of reservations from the intelligence services. And they suggest that despite early doubts among the security services about him, they eased over time and by the time he left his post, they had good relations. Another senior figure closely involved at the time blames a mixture of factors for the situation, citing Mr Johnson's perceived lack of discipline, nervousness among the intelligence community, and hostility between him and Theresa May. Ballot papers have now started landing on Tory members doormats. These revelations aren't likely to dim the zeal of some of Mr Johnson's ardent supporters. He is one of an unusual breed of politicians who is admired, perhaps as much, because of his flaws as despite them. But for those who doubt him, it's another area of concern, another tension any new prime minister could ill afford.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Man's surgery wait death 'avoidable', says ombudsman","Gareth Lewis Jones, from Neath Port Talbot, who had adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), died in March 2013 shortly before his operation was due. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board also failed to warn him about symptoms of deterioration to watch out for. The health board said several important changes had since been put in place. Following Mr Jones' death, his sister Sadie complained to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales about the time he waited for tests and said the board failed to properly advise her on symptoms, which indicated his condition was getting worse. 'Lack of urgency' The ombudsman found Mr Jones had waited nearly twice the recommended time for surgery and the health board failed to warn the family of symptoms which would have alerted them to the fact he needed urgent medical treatment in the days before his death. He also found there had been previous near misses with patients waiting for this type of surgery which should have prompted the health board to ensure every possible action was taken to minimise the risk of harm to ACHD patients. There was an apparent lack of urgency for treatment for ACHD patients within the health board as a whole, the investigation found. Ombudsman Nick Bennett said: ""On the balance of probabilities, had Mr X [Gareth Lewis Jones] received treatment earlier, it would have saved his life. The Welsh Government Referral to Treatment (RTT) target is 26 weeks. ""It is completely unacceptable that he waited nearly twice this time. ""I am pleased that the health board has agreed to my recommendations and I welcome steps that it is taking to address waiting times for patients with ACHD; however it is sadly too late for Mr X to benefit from any such improvements."" ABMU health board said: ""We would like to take this opportunity to apologise once more to the family of Mr X and offer our sincere condolences for their loss. ""We fully accept the recommendations made by the ombudsman, and can give assurances that several important changes have been put in place over the last three years."" The statement said surgery continued to be offered at a Bristol hospital, as had been the case with Mr Jones, but added: ""The management and processes supporting these patients have now been considerably tightened, and access to pre-surgical tests within Wales much improved.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Le Patourel brothers could be set for Guernsey blue plaque honour,"Plans to place the plaque at their former home in the Fosse Andre, in St Peter Port, have been submitted. John Herbert Le Patourel was a leader in the field of medieval studies, a professor at the University of Leeds and a fellow of the British Academy. His younger brother Herbert was serving in Tunisia in 1942 when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. Helen Glencross, secretary to the blue plaque panel, said of John Herbert Le Patourel: ""He was an eminent professor in medieval history archivist, he wrote about Guernsey and its history and was also archivist to the Royal Court [of Guernsey] and one of the founding members of the Guernsey Society."" Born in 1909, John Herbert Le Patourel attended Elizabeth College and Jesus College in Oxford before becoming a lecturer. His most well-known work, The Norman Empire, published in 1976, has been called a major landmark in Anglo-Norman studies. He also wrote about many aspects of the history of the Channel Islands including flora and fauna as well as political, economic and administrative history. Herbert Wallace Le Patourel was born in 1916 and after attending Elizabeth College worked in banking for four years, during which time he served as a lieutenant in the Royal Guernsey Militia before joining the regular army. On 9 March 1943 was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for ""conspicuous gallantry"" after he led four volunteers to silence several machine gun posts, continuing the attack on his own after the others had been killed or injured. Later on he was found to be alive as a prisoner of war in Italy and he was repatriated in 1943. Later promoted to Lieutenant Colonel he was given an official welcome to the island in 1948. A public consultation on the plans runs until 16 January with a decision due to be taken after that date. Victoria Cross citation Herbert Wallace Le Patourel, Captain (temporary Major) 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment ""On the afternoon of the 3rd December 1942, the enemy had occupied an important high feature on the left of the company commanded by this officer. Counter attacks by a company of another Battalion and detachments of Major Le Patourel's company had been unable to regain the position. This officer then personally led four volunteers under heavy fire to the top in a last attempt to dislodge several enemy machine guns. The party was then heavily engaged by machine gun fire, and Major Le Patourel rallied his men several times and engaged the enemy, silencing several machine-gun posts. Finally, when the remainder of his party were all killed or wounded, he went forward alone with a pistol and some grenades to attack enemy machine guns at close quarters and from this action did not return. From reports received from wounded men, this officer died of wounds. Major Le Patourel's most gallant conduct and self sacrifice, his brilliant leadership and tenacious devotion to duty in the face of a determined enemy were beyond praise.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Device aids 'virtual' treatment of Leicester patients,"University Hospitals of Leicester Trust said a small blood oxygen monitor meant it had treated 130 people at home. Patients take their own readings and are checked daily over the phone by a specially-trained nursing team. Andy Darcy, who fell ill in December and spent a night in hospital before moving on to the virtual system, said it was ""really beneficial"". Patients are initially assessed by Glenfield Hospital's clinical decisions unit to see if their symptoms meet the criteria for virtual treatment. Those who are willing and deemed suitable are then sent home with an oximeter which gives instant oxygen saturation readings - one of the key indicators of a Covid positive patient's condition. The trust said the ""ward"", which can contain between 20 and 30 patients, was first set up in October. Respiratory consultant Dr Daniela Cristea-Nicoara said: ""Coming into hospital at the moment is something patients want to avoid. ""A ward this size in hospital would require a high number of staff members but this can be managed daily by just five specialist nurses."" Dr Cristea-Nicoara said the system offered ""high-quality"" care, even if a patient's condition deteriorated. ""Based on the daily assessments we can make a decision on whether the patient needs to come back to hospital or whether they need more advanced treatment like being put on oxygen,"" she said. Mr Darcy, from Elmesthorpe in Leicestershire, first went to hospital on 14 December with chest pains and was diagnosed with coronavirus. He said: ""I was kept in overnight and then kept on a ward all day the next day. ""I was then discharged later that evening with an oxygen meter, a thermometer and some paperwork to tell me all about the virtual ward."" During his daily calls with a nurse he was asked about his symptoms, temperatures, oxygen levels and was guided through some breathing exercises. Positive feedback His oxygen levels dropped to a worrying level and he was asked to return to hospital where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was there for three days before being discharged back to the virtual hospital ward with a care plan. He said: ""It was really beneficial, not just from my point of view but for the hospital as well, because you could see they were really stretched. ""It meant I felt more comfortable and probably helped my recovery a little bit as well."" Dr Cristea-Nicoara said patient feedback gave 90% satisfaction for the system and a second ""virtual"" Covid ward had just been set up.

Monarch airline awaits package holiday licence decision,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch's licence by 24 hours on Saturday amid uncertainty about the company's future. However, with the deadline now passed, the regulator has yet to announce a decision on what it means for the UK's fifth biggest airline. About 10,000 people on holidays sold by the airline are thought to be abroad. The CAA is understood to have contingency plans in place to bring those passengers home on other airlines if Monarch faces difficulties. Monarch had until midnight on Sunday to reach a deal with the CAA - but neither the company nor the CAA have issued updates since then. If the regulator decides not to renew its package holiday licence, consumer confidence in Monarch's scheduled airline operations could also be undermined. Package holidays accounted for a fraction of the 6.3 million passengers Monarch carried last year to 40 destinations from Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Leeds-Bradford and Manchester airports. Atol protection The government's Atol scheme refunds customers if a travel firm collapses and ensures they are not stranded. The agreement with the CAA on Saturday means package holidays bought from Monarch on Sunday are still Atol protected. Monarch's owner, Greybull Capital, has been trying to sell part or all of its short-haul operation so it can focus on more profitable long-haul routes. The airline reported a loss of Â£291m for the year to October 2016, compared with a profit of Â£27m for the previous 12 months, after revenues slumped. Monarch, founded in 1968, is made up of a scheduled airline, tour operator and an engineering division. In total it employs about 2,500 people. The company said its flights are operating as normal, and that it continues to work on plans to resolve its future. Analysis: Monarch faces a 'perfect storm' By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent Monarch has experienced the perfect storm of challenges in recent years. The terror attacks in Turkey and Egypt have deprived the airline of a large chunk of its annual revenues, and forced it to compete on heavily congested traditional routes to Spain and Greece. That has forced down prices and profits on top of weaker demand from UK travellers - for whom a less valuable pound has made travelling costlier. Monarch will not be facing the winter with much confidence. The short-haul market has been described as ""horrendous"" by senior aviation industry figures. It has already resulted in the collapse of Air Berlin and placed huge pressure on other airlines. Put simply, there are too many seats and not enough bums to put on them to make a profit for all major carriers. Are you currently abroad with Monarch or planning to travel soon?

'Tuition grants affecting Welsh universities',"Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant to help poorer students. The Welsh government said its tuition fee policy has been a ""huge success"". Prof Riordan told BBC Wales' The Wales Report TV programme: ""If you took the same approach to the tuition fee grant, as you do with maintenance grants, you could free up considerable funding to allow Welsh universities to compete in the same way as other universities in the UK and that's really critical to the future of our country. ""There is no limit to the number of students that can go to university which means there is no limit to the money that is needed to fund the tuition fee policy and that means there is not enough money to fund Welsh universities."" Yesterday, First Minister Carwyn Jones defended the Welsh government's university tuition fees subsidy and rejected the idea that tuition fee support should be limited to Welsh students who study at universities in Wales rather than anywhere they study in the UK. 'Knowledge economy' He was responding to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood who said the current policy meant too much Welsh public money ended up going to English universities. On Sunday, outgoing Education Minister Huw Lewis told BBC Wales tuition fee grants would remain in place after May's assembly election if Labour retained power. Universities in Wales get the majority of their funding through the tuition fees paid by students. They also get an amount from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), around Â£90m a year, which has been cut this year by the Welsh government. Prof Riordan said it had seen a 40% cut to funding which would result in job losses and would affect students. ""The critical part is that the government needs to make sure than enough money is still available to fund all the areas that the tuition fee grant can't fund and that means making sure that funding is available to ensure that Welsh universities can continue to be the great success they've been over recent years,"" he said. ""The future prosperity of the people of Wales is in the knowledge economy and the universities are the building blocks of that economy"". A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""There is no doubt that we have had to make some tough decisions within this budget and we recognise that the cut to HEFCW will present challenges. ""We stand by our tuition fee grant policy which has been a huge success, has supported our learners to study a course and at an institution that is right for them, and has meant that Welsh graduates have left university with debts that are on average Â£22,000 lower than graduates from England.""

NHS pressure: Hospital corridors 'the new emergency wards',"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The warning comes as figures for the NHS in England showed January was one of the most difficult months on record. Record numbers of seriously-ill patients faced delays waiting for a bed - with 1,000 waiting over 12 hours. It comes despite the mass cancellation of routine treatments to ease pressure. The move was ordered by NHS bosses before Christmas when it became clear hospitals were struggling. Can't find your health trust? Browse the full list Rather search by typing? Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here. But the four-hour A&E target was still missed for the 30th month in a row; with 85.3% of patients seen, marginally better than the 85.1% in December. Similar performance is being recorded in Scotland, while Wales and Northern Ireland are doing even worse. However, it was the issue of finding beds that has sparked most alarm. These are known as trolley waits, because patients often find themselves on trolleys in side-rooms and corridors until a bed comes free on a ward. These tend to be the most seriously-ill patients, so doctors decide to admit them on to a ward rather than treat them in A&E. Some 81,000 waited more than four hours for a bed in England - one in five of the 390,000 people who needed to be admitted. Both the four-hour and 12-hour figures for trolley waits were the worst on record - figures go back to 2010. But this does come amid rising numbers of A&E attendances. The data from NHS England shows more than two million patients came to A&E during the month, a rise of more than 5% in a year. Health bosses said with that in mind - and the high levels of flu that have been seen in the worst outbreak since 2011 - the NHS has performed well. Ian Dalton, chief executive at the regulator NHS Improvement, said it was a ""testament"" to the dedication of staff that performance had not declined further. But Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said the health service was ""creaking at the seams"". He said the growing number of trolley waits showed ""corridors had become the new emergency wards"". A spokesperson for the Royal College of Surgeons said: ""These figures show just how tough it was for hospitals this winter despite cancellation of planned surgery to free up capacity. ""Surgeons and other frontline NHS staff are working tirelessly to provide the best care possible to patients. But today's figures show that these short-term measures are insufficient to meet NHS targets."" Additional reporting by Clara Guibourg",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Celebrities join calls to axe sixth-form 'learning tax',"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter, BBC News Unlike schools and academies, sixth-form colleges in England are unable to claim back their VAT costs. The government says they are liable for VAT because they were categorised as private-sector organisations by the Office of National Statistics. The Sixth Form Colleges' Association called the anomaly ""a clear injustice"". It argues that failure to refund VAT to sixth-form colleges amounts to a tax that leaves the average sixth-form college with Â£335,000 less to spend on students' education each year. High quality ""The government should drop the learning tax to ensure sixth-form colleges can continue to provide students with the high quality education they need to succeed and prosper,"" said SFCA deputy chief executive James Kewin. An e-petition urging the government to rectify the situation has attracted more than 11,000 signatures since it was set up late last month. Colleges approached former pupils to sign the petition. Colin Firth, a former student at Barton Peveril sixth-form college in Hampshire, and broadcaster Dermot O'Leary were among those who did so. ""My experience of sixth-form college was extremely positive,"" said Mr O'Leary, who studied at Colchester sixth-form college. ""The teachers took a real interest in my education and encouraged me to get involved in a range of extra-curricular activities. ""I'm supporting the drop-the-learning-tax campaign because I want future sixth-form college students to benefit from the sort of education that has served me so well over the years."" The SFCA argues that allowing sixth forms to claim back their VAT would go some way towards plugging the funding gap left by cuts since 2010. The association says research last year found more than two-thirds of colleges had axed courses due to cuts and almost three-quarters had reduced extra curricular activities such as drama. music and sport. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We have ended the historic and unfair funding difference between post-16 schools and colleges by funding them per student, rather than discriminating between qualifications. ""This ensures young people are studying high quality courses that will help them get on in their lives. ""The funding is sufficient for each full-time student to undertake a full timetable of courses to suit their needs, be it A-levels or other post-16 qualifications. ""It is for individual institutions to decide on what they provide to best suit the needs of their students.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Edinburgh's Christmas: Market did not have 2018 planning consent,"Underbelly are still awaiting planning permission to operate in 2019/20, and still need a crucial building warrant. The council said the market would not go ahead as planned on Saturday if the warrant was refused. It comes after safety fears were raised over the scaffolding which supports a platform that will house the market in Princes Street Gardens. The council is also investigating Underbelly's contract extension. Planning permission is being applied for retrospectively and is expected to be granted by the time the Christmas Market closes in January. Underbelly's approved planning application expired on 10 January 2018 - no application was made to renew the consent in time for last year's event. Organisers earlier said they were ""acutely aware"" of this year's controversy. Council leader Adam McVey said he had asked Underbelly's chief executive to get to the bottom of the issue ""as a matter of urgency"" and to ensure there were no repeats in future. He said: ""I'm extremely disappointed that Underbelly did not apply for the proper consents for Christmas 2018/19 as it was their responsibility to do so under the contract. ""That said, there are clearly lessons to be learned for our own processes both in terms of contract management and enforcement."" He added that the council's building standards and public safety teams were carrying out final inspections and checks of the site before it was expected to open. A spokesperson for Underbelly said: ""We look forward to the inquiry that councillor McVey has asked for and to contributing fully to the reasons why we are in the position we are now in. ""Our previous planning permission ran for four years but expired in January 2018; and we operated under the same conditions as applied for in the previous year. ""With the new arrangement in place, agreed by the council on 12 October, we are in the process of applying for the next planning consent."" Internal investigation Mr McVey said: ""We've also recommended and approved pedestrian-only access on Waverley Bridge from 11:00 to 17:00 on Saturdays and Sundays to make it much easier for everyone to move around in a relaxed, fun and welcoming atmosphere."" The council has also launched an internal investigation into whether the correct processes were followed in handing over a two-year contract extension to the operator. Edinburgh City Council's culture and communities committee considered a motion by Green councillor Alex Staniforth, calling to ""urgently collaborate"" with Underbelly. It called on the parties ""to look at options"" for relocating this year's event to a hard-standing location in central Edinburgh. However, councillors instead agreed a Conservative amendment, which would require officials to draw up options for next year's event - including moving the market.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Diana documentary: What the critics said,"It featured Diana speaking candidly about her upbringing, her troubled marriage and her public life. Some viewers agreed with the tapes being aired, but others called the documentary ""sensationalist"" and ""trashy"". The programme secured Channel 4's highest overnight viewing figures in more than a year. It was watched by an average audience of 3.5 million and a peak of 4.1 million, according to overnight ratings. These figures include those watching on Channel 4+1 an hour later. 'Betrayal of privacy' The footage was recorded between 1992 and 1993 by Peter Settelen, a voice coach who was hired by Diana to help her with her public speaking. The controversial tapes had been criticised by some of Diana's close friends ahead of its television debut. Rosa Monckton wrote to Channel 4 asking them not to broadcast the tapes. She told the Guardian they were ""a betrayal of her privacy and of the family's privacy"". The critics' verdict Writing in the Times, Andrew Billen gave the documentary two out of five stars and said that ""it was pretentious and trashy."" The Daily Mail's Jan Moir said that she thought Diana would have loved the tapes being broadcast, as it showed her in a ""golden light; rueful, amused, heartbreakingly vivacious and beautiful, noble in her obvious loneliness"". But she criticised the narration and music calling it ""ridiculous"" and ""melodramatic"". Mark Lawson wrote in the Guardian: ""Despite its faults and opportunism, it has as much right to be shown as the Bashir interview or her sons' ITV documentary"". But Lawson also calls the documentary ""manipulative"", describing the editing as slick and sly and ""constantly telling the audience how to feel"". In the Daily Mirror, Ian Hyland said he was livid after watching the documentary, adding: ""That was two hours of my life I will never get back."" 'Poignant and beautifully done' During its broadcast on Sunday night, viewers shared their opinions across social media with many saying how heartbreaking the programme was. But many others expressed their disdain at the programming - with some calling it exploitative and inappropriate. The Sun's showbiz reporter Dan Wootton said that there hadn't been anyone more charismatic than Diana. Some agreed with the tapes being aired, suggesting that Princess Diana would not have recorded them if she didn't want them to be shown. Journalist Chrissie Russell was impressed by Channel 4's efforts, tweeting: ""I don't think anyone expected that to be so poignant, moving and beautifully done"".

Ex-Cardiff children's home boss jailed for sex abuse,"Patrick Grant, 69, from Cardiff, was convicted at Inner London Crown Court of three counts of indecent assault at a south Wales home in the 1980s. Grant, the superintendent, would sneak into his victim's room at night and molest him under the bedclothes. He was also found guilty of three counts of indecently assaulting two others. One victim was assaulted between January 1976 and May 1977, while another victim was assaulted between February 1977 and February 1978. The latter offences took place at children's homes in Surrey and London. Grant was acquitted of a similar allegation in the late 1970s, and was then allowed to return to the profession. Some of the abuse for which he has been jailed occurred prior to his acquittal, but the abuse of a boy at the south Wales home took place after he had been acquitted. One victim, who was abandoned by his mother, went onto abuse glue and sniff petrol, and later turned to cannabis and heroin. He blames his behaviour on the abuse he suffered from Grant. 'His words haunted me' In a victim impact statement he said he often fled from the south Wales home, and said: ""Each time I ran away from the home I was picked up by the police and told them what was happening, but they did nothing."" He was homeless in London for 24 years and once attempted suicide. He said: ""Patrick Grant always said to me he would make me disappear. Words that have always haunted me."" Recorder of Southwark Judge Usha Karu told Grant,: ""You went into one boy's bedroom and touched his private parts under the bedclothes, sometimes over. ""Once, when he wanted to say 'stop' you put your hand over his mouth."" The judge added: ""Each of these three victims have been severely traumatised by what happened to them. ""This was undoubtedly a gross abuse of trust and use of threats, telling a child you would make them disappear and that nobody would believe them. ""Each suffered severe psychological harm that they will carry for the rest of their lives."" Regarding his acquittal in the 1970s the judge told Grant: ""It could be said there was a shot passed across your bows, but you continued to offend.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Martin McGuinness hopeful of welfare deal by middle of week,"Sinn FÃ©in withdrew support for the welfare reform bill last week. The move has raised questions about the future of devolved government and talks have been taking place to solve the impasse. Mr McGuinness told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ that a solution to the crisis was being worked on. ""I've been involved in discussions since last Monday with [first minister] Peter Robinson on a consistent basis. We have identified a way forward, which I think can resolve this difficulty,"" he said. 'Own resources' ""As we speak officials are working on all of this. ""I'll be meeting Peter Robinson again tomorrow. I would hope by the middle of the week that we would have an agreement."" When asked by RTÃ how a new welfare system would be funded, the deputy first minister said: ""I think that's a matter is presently under discussion. ""As a result of identifying a way forward, we have also identified how it will be funded, but it will be funded from within our own resources."" Earlier, Mr McGuinness and Mr Robinson confirmed they would not travel to the White House for St Patrick's Day, in order to continue talks over the welfare impasse. The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform in the Stormont House Agreement in December. The issue had previously threatened the future of the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive. Last week Sinn FÃ©in withdrew support for the welfare reform bill, accusing the DUP of going back on what had been agreed. The DUP rejected this, saying there had never been the money for all the things Sinn FÃ©in wanted and that Sinn FÃ©in had been aware of this. 'Number one priority' Mr Robinson tweeted on Sunday: ""White House agree priority is to maintain momentum in finding a resolution to welfare issue. Best to be in Northern Ireland dealing with it."" In a statement, Mr McGuinness said: ""The number one priority for me and my party is finding a resolution to the difficulties currently facing the executive. ""Progress has been made in talks between the parties but there is still a lot of work to be done. ""I have decided therefore in the best interests of trying to move the situation forward that I will not be travelling to the US to take part in events marking St Patrick's Day."" On Friday, Mr Robinson said he did not want to put President Barack Obama in an embarrassing position and if there was still a crisis over welfare it would be ""absurd"" for him to travel to Washington.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ex-MI6 boss warns over electronic voting risk,"Sir John Sawers told the BBC that casting a ballot with pencil and paper was ""actually much more secure"". He warned: ""The more things that go online, the more susceptible you are to cyber attacks."" But campaigners for electronic voting said there was ""no evidence"" it was more open to fraud. Electronic voting allows people to make their choices via a computer or smartphone, instead of people having to go to a polling station. 'Robust systems needed' Sir John's warning comes after the US government accused Russia of hacking into the emails of leading Democrats and interfering in the recent presidential election. This has increased concerns among security experts as to whether vital national electronic systems are vulnerable to malicious disruption by other countries. Sir John, head of MI6 from 2009 until 2014, told the BBC Radio 4 documentary The New World: Axis of Power, which examines the state of international tensions between the world's leading powers: ""We need to have systems which are robust."" He said: ""The only trouble is, the younger generation of people expect to be able to do things remotely and through electronic devices. ""Bizarrely the stubby pencil and piece of paper that you put your cross on in the ballot box is actually much more secure than anything which is electronic."" 'Radical changes' Commons Speaker John Bercow's Commission on Digital Democracy has called for secure online voting to be an option for all voters by the 2020 UK general election. And the Electoral Commission has also been looking into making ""radical changes"" to the system. Areeq Chowdhury, chief executive of WebRoots Democracy, which campaigns for electronic voting, said: ""There is no evidence to show that online voting is more susceptible to fraud than the paper alternative. ""There have been more instances of fraud across the world with paper votes than electronic ones, and the recent recounts of electronic votes in the US showed no evidence of hacking."" But Sir John told The New World: ""One of the big problems we face with cyber is that it hasn't really been discussed internationally about what is an acceptable use of cyber powers and where are the red lines and what happens when those red lines are crossed. ""We're at a very early stage. It's a bit like with nuclear weapons back in the 1950s. We've got the capabilities, but there are no rules lined up as to how they should be used.""

Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors,"By Louise CullenBBC NI News Green Pastures church plans to build an urban village on the edge of Ballymena, with housing, business parks, a hotel and community facilities. Planners recommended the project for approval on Tuesday. The planning committee of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has now voted to pass the application. Five councillors voted in favour of the application, with four voting against it. Under local government reforms, Northern Ireland's 11 new super-councils now have the final say over most planning decisions. Viability Pastor Jeff Wright, who founded Green Pastures, told the committee they would be ""saying yes"" to 1,000 jobs. Green Pastures has said the development will create 100 apprenticeships, 80 safe houses for vulnerable adults and 104 care places for children with special needs. Planners had previously rejected a supermarket element of the plan, saying it would undermine the viability and vitality of the town centre. But a revised application reducing the size of the supermarket from 6,100sq m to 4,100sq m was accepted this week. The planners said the smaller retail scheme now complies with planning policies. Councillor Robert Logan, the chair of the planning committee, said the application had been ""long-running and complex"". ""The committee understands that not everyone in Ballymena will be in favour of the development. However, this decision was based on the evidence that was presented to the committee. ""Every planning decision made by councillors is made on a professional basis, in line with policy and taking into account the advice provided by our planning experts."" Spend In a statement, the Green Pastures project board said the committee had made a ""once in a lifetime decision which will leave a lasting legacy for generations to come"". ""All of this is a not-for-profit project with the primary purpose of helping people,"" it added. ""At a time when job losses and cutbacks are looming over our town, we believe this is an incredible good news story which will bring spending power back to our borough."" Ian Paisley, the DUP MP for the area, said a food superstore is ""the lynchpin"" of the project. ""Without this building block, foundation stone, the application wouldn't proceed at all,"" he said. ""Ballymena is about to lose 870 jobs at beginning of 2017. If you don't have jobs, you won't have spend for any shop whether an edge-of-town or town centre."" Devastating But his party colleague, Paul Frew MLA, objected to the proposal on the basis that it would harm Ballymena town centre. He told the committee: ""I support Green Pastures in their outreach within Ballymena. I also support the application for a church and social housing and some large-scale retail. ""But I cannot support an out-of-town shopping centre which will have a devastating effect for at least 300 years."" An objection was also raised by the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association. Its chief executive Glyn Roberts said: ""This application belongs in the past, not the future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Why good economics can make for bad politics,"Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent India's beleaguered Congress-led ruling coalition in Delhi is discovering that, in its attempts to push through major economic reforms. On Tuesday evening, its unpredictable ally the Trinamool Congress pulled out from the government over its plans to open the retail sector to global supermarket chains and other economic reforms. An intriguing lack of political consensus and informed public debate over the reforms, and an intensely fragmented polity, has scuppered attempts at key reforms - upgrading the country's archaic labour laws and eliminating non-essential subsidies, are two standout examples. The near-complete breakdown in cooperation between the two main national parties - the Congress and the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party - hasn't helped matters. Most regional parties have remained local in their outlook and have been found wanting in articulating their positions on the issues that will determine the future of India: What direction should the economy take? What should be India's place in the world? So India's politics, many believe, has often been reduced to brinkmanship, bargaining and grabbing concessions from the state. Lack of inner-party democracy means that the politics of most parties - including the Congress - is largely held hostage to a bunch of regional satraps and their families. So what could happen now that the Congress government has become a minority one? Analysts point to a number of scenarios: the government can roll back the reforms (unlikely); continue to run a minority government like the one run by the late prime minister PV Narasimha Rao with the support of a couple of regional parties from outside (likely); the opposition pushes for a confidence vote against the government in parliament (possible); and the Congress decides to go for broke and call an early election (highly unlikely). Some people say India is already staring at an early election. My hunch is that the Congress government will continue to limp along with the support of some regional parties and independents until the summer of 2014, when the next elections are due. It will be an enfeebled, lameduck government, prone to pressure from parties who are supporting it. Not a very happy picture, but when did good politics make for good economics?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Enterprise zones tax break bids expected after delay,"A form of tax cuts will be available in a zone on Deeside, but the Treasury says it has not had proposals from the Welsh government about other zones. The Welsh government said it was ready to submit bids after the Treasury clarified its position last week. But a Conservative MP accused ministers in Cardiff of a lack of action. Seven enterprise zones are being established in Wales, each intended to nurture specific industries. Chancellor George Osborne announced in March that enhanced capital allowances will be offered at a manufacturing zone in Deeside. Invest The allowances cut the tax bills of businesses which invest in plant and machinery. The Welsh government has been asked to come forward with proposals about which other zones should benefit from allowances. But in a letter to Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns on 11 October, Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said no further representations had arrived from Cardiff. Bids were on hold while the Welsh government sought clarification from the Treasury about what other forms of help, such as grants, can be offered to businesses. Business Minister Edwina Hart has said UK government restrictions mean companies can only be offered enhanced capital allowances or grants, not both. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""It is disappointing that this letter to Alun Cairns MP gives the impression that the Welsh government has simply not responded to the opportunity to agree Enhance Capital Allowances (ECAs) for other sites - this is not the case. ""Our position has always been clear. As the minister for business, enterprise, technology and science explained to assembly members in July, we would not submit further proposals until Treasury clarified its intention to prevent any other aid to companies claiming ECAs. ""These restrictions would significantly reduce the attractiveness of ECAs and have a disproportionate effect in Wales, where we have enterprise zones in assisted areas."" He added: ""The minister wrote to Treasury in May and August on this matter. We received some clarification from Treasury at the end of last week and the minister has since responded. ""Officials will now be submitting proposals for other sites in line with the clarification received from Treasury."" A Treasury spokesman said it expected to see proposals from the Welsh government soon after recent correspondence between both sides. An aerospace zone based around Cardiff airport and St Athan is being established in Mr Cairns' constituency. The Tory MP said: ""It is hard to believe that the Welsh government have done nothing about gaining this tax advantage for Welsh employers. ""It is obvious that the Treasury are keen to extend this benefit to businesses operating in Wales but can only do so when Edwina Hart explains exactly what she wants to do.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Germany migrant shelter fire 'cheered by onlookers',"The fire in the town of Bautzen in the early hours of Sunday morning destroyed the roof of a former hotel, which was being converted into a migrant shelter. Police said some of the crowd tried to prevent firefighters from extinguishing the blaze, which destroyed the roof. The premier of Saxony, Stanislaw Tillich, described them as ""criminals"". Police suspect arson. The investigation includes detectives who normally deal with extremist crimes. No-one was hurt. 'Unashamed delight' Only a few days ago, protesters in another Saxon town, Clausnitz, blocked the arrival of a bus taking migrants to accommodation. They shouted, ""We are the people"", the slogan of the 1989 peaceful uprising which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. The director of the Clausnitz migrant shelter is a member of the anti-immigrant Alternativ fuer Deutschland (AfD) party. Police in Bautzen said many in the crowd watched the fire and commented with ""unashamed delight"". Two drunken men were arrested after they refused to leave the scene. The converted hotel was supposed to house 300 migrants. In a further sign of anti-migrant sentiment, police in the Brandenburg region are investigating the distribution of leaflets urging ""absolute resistance"" against ""foreigner invasion"". The leaflets, put through letterboxes in the town of Nauen, are the suspected work of neo-Nazis. They also give instructions on making firebombs and using explosives. On Saturday, police defended their response to events in Clausnitz after two videos surfaced online. The first video showed 100 hostile demonstrators preventing a bus from off-loading migrants into their accommodation on Thursday. A second appeared to show police roughly manhandling a boy from the bus into the building. The regional police chief said there were too few police to keep the protesters away, and three of those inside the bus had provoked the crowd. Germany received over a million asylum claims in 2015 and has been widely admired for opening its doors. But with that have come increasing reports of anti-migrant incidents amid fears of a backlash, correspondents say. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Wild animals circus ban passes first Holyrood vote,"MSPs unanimously signed off the general principles of the ban, which would be the first of its kind in the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said using animals in this manner was ""morally objectionable"". MSPs raised a series of issues with the bill, including a lack of definitions, but voted it through to allow amendments at committee stage. The Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses (Scotland) Bill aims to bolster animal protection by barring any use of wild animals in travelling shows. It has drawn criticism from circus leaders, who told MSPs that a law based on the proposed ethical grounds ""will eventually close your zoos"". However, a public consultation found widespread support for a ban, something Ms Cunningham referred to in the chamber. She said: ""Most people now consider it outdated and morally wrong to make wild animals perform tricks that they would not perform naturally or to display them in an unnatural environment simply to entertain the viewing public. ""This is animals as entertainment commodity rather than as sentient beings."" 'Paradise for lawyers' The Conservatives and Labour both backed the proposals, but raised concerns about the bill's definition of a wild animal and claimed there was no definition of what a circus was. Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said that ""strangely for a bill all about circuses, the bill chooses not to define the word circus"". His Tory colleague Finlay Carson said the bill as drafted ""would be a paradise for lawyers"". And Labour's David Stewart said that while the move overall was ""the right direction"" for animal welfare, a definition of circuses should be ""included in the face of the bill"". Holyrood's environment committee warned in its report on the bill that the legislation in its current form is ""at risk of not fully addressing the issues it has been proposed to cover and capturing animal performances it had not been intended to"". But Ms Cunningham insisted that concerns over definitions were ""unfounded"", saying: ""The bill before you will not stop the use of domestic animals in travelling circuses such as dogs and horses or the use of wild animals in displays in static circuses, zoos or at public galleries. ""Penguin parades at zoos, birds of prey demonstrations at fairs and reindeer displays will not be affected."" The bill will now move to committee stage, where amendments could be proposed, before a final debate and set of votes in the Holyrood chamber before it becomes law.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Essex County Council HQ swastikas should be removed says UKIP group,"Earlier this week, it was reported the markings on County Hall had been deemed ""potentially upsetting"". The carvings on Chelmsford's County Hall, built between 1928 and 1939, were made shortly before World War Two. Although the swastika is an ancient peace symbol, the council's UKIP group said most would associate it with Nazism and wants the carvings removed. The county council said the swastikas were included in designs finalised in 1926 and removing them would be costly and require special permission. The issue came to light after a Freedom of Information request was lodged with the council asking why the design ""was still commissioned given the symbol's negative connotations"". The person requesting the information, who has not been named, said the timing of the swastika symbols ""struck me as strange seeing as the Nazi party formed in 1933 and by March 1938 were beginning an invasion into Austria. ""It's potentially offensive and upsetting to those that lost loved ones in the war or those that fought for their country,"" the person wrote in their request. Jamie Huntman, leader of the UKIP group on the county council, said he has requested an ""extraordinary meeting"" with the authority's chief executive Joanna Killian. Mr Huntman said removing the symbols would be ""very simple"". He said although he understood the swastika was an ancient Hindu symbol of peace, County Hall was ""not a Hindu temple"". ""I've got relatives who fought in the war,"" he said. ""I find it offensive. I am very proud of being English and British and what our young men fought for, and against. ""Whenever I see that symbol, the first thing I - and I believe most people - think of is Nazism."" But a spokesman for the county council: ""Plans for the County Hall building were drawn up from 1908 and our records show that the architect was ordered to finalise the plans in October 1926. ""Given similar designs are featured on a number of other public buildings of similar age across the world, including churches and universities, it is important that the symbol is seen in its architectural context. ""This part of County Hall has Grade II listed status and any changes to this frontage could be extremely costly to the public purse and would have to be approved by English Heritage.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Amber Peat: Hanged girl, 13, 'felt her dog was treated better'","Amber Peat's teacher David Wallace said he drove her home because her mother and step-father were dealing with their pet after it went into labour. Amber's body was discovered in bushes three days after she went missing in Mansfield in 2015. Mr Wallace had ""a gut feeling"" something was wrong in the family, Nottingham Coroner's Court heard. Amber, 13, had gone missing from home on 3 April, 2014, when she and her family lived in Tibshelf and more than a year before her death. Mr Wallace, a teacher at Tibshelf Community School, received a call saying she had been found at the school, and after he checked she was OK, he rang her family to see if it was safe to return her home. He was told over the phone neither mum Kelly nor step-father Daniel Peat could come to collect her as their dog was in labour, so he asked for permission to take her home himself. Amber was ""very quiet"" on the drive home, Mr Wallace said, but added ""she remarked that they wouldn't care, they were more interested in the dog"". There was ""minimal emotion"" when Amber was returned, Mr Wallace said, and though the house ""needed a little bit of work"" there was no sign she was in any danger. Staff at Tibshelf considered referring Amber to social care, the inquest heard, but these plans were shelved when her family agreed to meet them to discuss her behaviour. At a meeting in May 2014, Mr Wallace said Amber and her parents had appeared ""very forced and contrived"" and he had ""a gut feeling"" all was not well at home. Peter Kenworthy, pastoral lead at Tibshelf, said ""with hindsight"" the school could have pushed to refer Amber's case to social care services. But he told the inquest a focus at the time was on ensuring improvements in her behaviour since joining the school was not undone by the disruption of another move. Before her final disappearance Amber had run away in January and February 2014. But this only came to light after a GP had asked staff from a multi-agency team (MAT) run by Derbyshire County Council to visit the family. Sarah Hart, from Tibshelf MAT, carried out a visit after the January incident with her colleague Mark Hearn, but despite hearing her disappearances had not been reported to police she said Amber seemed ""happy"". She said the visit on 14 January was to gain ""a snapshot"" of home life that would be investigated more thoroughly by other staff at a later date. The inquest continues.

Leeds war hero's statue could be moved to heritage centre,"Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron, from Leeds, was killed on a bombing mission in Italy. The RAF pilot was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for gallantry after his death in 1943, aged 21. Campaigners want to relocate his statue from a city centre roundabout to a heritage centre closer to his home in Oakwood, near Roundhay Park. Dr Stewart Manning, of the Bring Him Home campaign, said: ""His memorial needs to be somewhere local. He was born here, he was brought up here, he went to school here and it enables us to treat him with respect. ""At the moment he's in the middle of a roundabout in Leeds where people don't see him."" Dr Manning said he also wanted to create a memorial garden dedicated to the hero who showed a ""real act of courage"". Flt Sgt Aaron was captain of a bomber that came under fire while approaching Turin. A bullet broke his jaw and tore away part of his face. He died five hours after bringing his plane safely in to land. ""Despite the fact he was badly injured, he flew his plane back, parts of his body were missing, he was given morphine and he landed the plane and saved the lives of three people,"" Dr Manning said. His statue was erected on Eastgate after a public vote in 2000. Leeds City Council said it was putting together a full report, which was due to be considered by councillors at a later date. Who was Arthur Aaron? Flt Sgt Arthur Louis Aaron was born on 5 March 1922 in Leeds and educated in the city. He was captain and pilot of a Stirling bomber that was due to attack Turin, Italy, on 12 August 1943, his 20th operational flight. The aircraft was hit and three engines damaged. The windscreen shattered, the front and rear turrets were put out of action and the plane became unstable and difficult to control. As well as his facial injuries, Flt Sgt Aaron's right arm was rendered useless. His navigator was killed in the attack. After treatment with morphine in the aircraft and despite his injuries, Flt Sgt Aaron summoned his failing strength to direct the bomb aimer in landing the plane in Algeria, but died a few hours later. He was posthumously awarded the VC and the Distinguished Flying Medal. His citation, in The London Gazette, read: ""Had he been content, when grievously wounded, to lie still and conserve his failing strength, he would probably have recovered, but he saw it as his duty to exert himself to the utmost, if necessary with his last breath, to ensure that his aircraft and crew did not fall into enemy hands.""

Councils fixed more potholes as budgets grew,"Some 330,000 more potholes were filled than in 2017/18, with spending on roads maintenance up 20%, a study says. However, the Asphalt Industry Alliance annual survey suggests much of the Â£24.5m was spent on short-term ""patch and mend"" work to 1.86 million holes. Councils would need to spend Â£9.79bn over 10 years to bring all roads up to scratch, the AIA says. The Local Government Association says fixing roads is a priority. ""Faced with severe financial pressures, councils have managed to spend more on road repairs in the past year in order to fix a pothole every 17 seconds,"" said Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the body which represents councils. However, the AIA says the responses of local authorities to its survey revealed a ""big discrepancy"" in spending on roads between different councils. Some local authorities in England received highway maintenance funding equivalent to more than Â£90,000 per mile last year, while others had less than 10% of that, it said. AIA chairman Rick Green said: ""Sustained investment over a longer time frame is needed if we want a local road network that supports enhanced mobility, connectivity and productivity."" AA president Edmund King said the survey suggested the country was ""beginning to find its way out of the rut"". ""Increased funding and a milder winter presents an opportunity to begin to catch up on the backlog - but any slackening off will simply pitch our roads back into a deep hole,"" he said. RAC figures show drivers are two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer a pothole-related breakdown than in 2006. Its patrols received 1,714 call-outs between October and December 2018 for problems usually caused by road defects, such as damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Potholes are a huge problem for all road users and the government is taking action, providing local authorities with more than Â£6.6bn for roads maintenance and pothole repair in the six years to 2021."" The government is also trialling new technologies to stop potholes from forming and consulting on increasing the standards of roadworks by utility companies to help keep roads pothole-free for longer, he added.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hong Kong student's death sparks impromptu protests and vigils,"Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation to clear the area on Monday morning. The exact circumstances of his fall are unclear, but reports say he was trying to get away from tear gas. The 22-year-old's death came after another week of political violence in Hong Kong. On Wednesday a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a person pretending to be a supporter. Mr Chow had been in a coma since Monday and was certified dead early on Friday, according to the hospital he was treated in. Fellow students at the city's University of Science and Technology called for an investigation into how Mr Chow fell, and why it took paramedics nearly 20 minutes to arrive. Amnesty International echoed that call. At the time of his fall, dozens of riot police were approaching, firing tear gas into the car park and surrounding areas to clear away protesters. Police said they used tear gas to disperse protesters near the site but denied any wrongdoing, saying their actions had been justified. But Mr Chow's death is expected to fuel more anger at the police, who are already under pressure as Hong Kong faces its worst crisis in decades. ""Today we mourn the loss of the freedom fighter in HK,"" Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy campaigner, said on Twitter. ""We will not leave anyone behind - what we start together, we finish together."" Protesters gathered across the city, taking part in mourning events. Thousands left flowers at the spot in which he fell at the car park. Some people sang hymns. A 23-year-old student, who said she attended the same university as Mr Chow, told AFP news agency: ""I think there should be an independent inquiry commission to investigate his death and other incidents that happened during the movement."" Other people gathered in the shopping district of Causeway Bay, lining the streets in silence. At Hong Kong's University of Science and Technology, dozens of protesters vandalised a Starbucks, Bank of China and at least three cafeterias on site, the South China Morning Post reports. They wrote ""condemn police brutality"" on the walls of the Starbucks store. Protesters are calling for more demonstrations this weekend. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms. The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Sheffield family 'betrayed' over gambling death case,"Chris Bruney, 25, died after being given VIP status by a gambling firm that did not check he could afford it. The Gambling Commission (GC) said PT Entertainment Services could have faced a fine of at least Â£3.5m. But it did not have to pay out after surrendering its operating licence during the inquiry, the GC said. Parent company Playtech has pledged to donate Â£5m to charities over the next five years as part of a strategy to promote better online health. In a statement, Mr Bruney's family said: ""We found the courage to start this investigation and our trust has been betrayed. ""We want answers as to how the Gambling Commission allowed the company to close down before there were regulatory actions. ""We want Playtech to pay the proper fine of Â£3.5m and for individuals to be held to account."" The GC said it would be opening a consultation to make permanent changes to the way ""operators recruit and incentivise high value customers"". Charity Gambling with Lives said Mr Bruney, of Sheffield, had been ""groomed by VIP schemes to gamble intensively despite showing clear indications of gambling disorder"". The organisation, which supports families who have been bereaved by gambling-related suicide, called for VIP schemes to be banned. Shortly before his death in April 2017, Mr Bruney gambled away Â£119,395 with the company failing to verify whether he could afford to play. Mr Bruney's accounts showed he had a net loss of Â£34,068, when they were closed following his suicide. The GC investigation found the company gave ""no consideration"" to problem gambling checks. The commission's chief executive Neil McArthur, said: ""Although PT Entertainment Services has ceased trading we decided to complete our investigation and publish our findings, as the lessons from this tragic case must be learned by all operators. ""Our investigations into the role played by key individuals at PT Entertainment Services are continuing. As such, it would be inappropriate to say more about the specific case at this time."" Playtech said the decision to close the two websites used by Mr Bruney - winner.co.uk and titanbet.co.uk - was taken before it was notified of the investigation. It said PT Entertainment Services's licence had already been due to expire in October 2019. That same month, the company donated about Â£620,000 to charity. A Playtech spokesman said the company had since ""invested significantly"" to ensure similar breaches do not occur again. He said: ""PT Entertainment Services' actions fell significantly short of the high standards we set ourselves as a group."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

US 'preparing indictment against Julian Assange' of WikiLeaks,"The reports came as a filing in a separate court case hinted that charges were being prepared. Justice officials said the filing was made in error. Mr Assange fled to Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations - a case since dropped. He has also stayed in the embassy over fears of extradition to the US. It is not clear what charges Mr Assange would face there. However, the US Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian election interference has suggested that WikiLeaks was used by Russian intelligence to distribute hacked material. US spy agencies say Russia aimed to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election. Russia denies the allegations. Wikileaks published thousands of emails hacked from Democrats during the presidential race between Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton. The separate court case involves defendant, Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, who is charged with coercion and enticement of a minor. The filing about the case was from a prosecutor in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant US Attorney Kellen Dwyer. In the filing, Mr Dwyer says documents should remain sealed because ""due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged"". The documents ""would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter"", Mr Dwyer goes on to say. It was not clear if any charges against Mr Assange had been filed. The Justice Department said the filing was a mistake, without specifying why, while WikiLeaks believed it was a ""cut and paste"" error. One of Mr Assange's lawyers told the Guardian newspaper that charging someone for publishing accurate information was a ""dangerous path for a democracy to take"". ""The news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed,"" Barry Pollack told the newspaper. The US media reports say US officials are increasingly confident that Mr Assange will be detained and face charges in the US. Earlier this year the British government said it was holding talks with Ecuador over Mr Assange's fate. Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno has said he was never ""in favour"" of Mr Assange's activities and has described him as a ""stone in our shoe"". The US also wants Mr Assange in connection with Wikileaks publishing hundreds of thousands of confidential US diplomatic cables in 2010 as well as other files including video footage of an US Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007 during the Iraq War. In 2017, Wikileaks published thousands of CIA secret documents, including what it said was the CIA's hacking tools.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Plaid Cymru call for all Commons debates to be digital,"With the UK under lockdown and MPs returning from recess on Tuesday, members of parliament will take part in hybrid meetings with up to 120 attending online and some in person. But Plaid's Jonathan Edwards said the arrangement potentially forced MPs who live far from London to travel. The Commons said the system was an ""achievable first step towards a virtual Parliament"". MPs will need to agree measures when they return from the extended Commons break. The Welsh Assembly was the first UK parliament to sit virtually in March, using the video conferencing app Zoom. The House of Commons Commission has agreed for up to 120 MPs to take part in proceedings online. Around 50 could remain in the chamber under social distancing rules. The commission says all MPs are being encouraged to work virtually. Mr Edwards, the MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said: ""The House of Commons being recalled is an important step in ensuring the concerns of our constituents are heard and the UK government is held to account"". But he is disappointed some proceedings will continue to require MPs to attend in person, adding: ""It is not only unnecessary, but potentially exclusionary, as MPs not based in and around London will be forced to travel to make a contribution to certain debates"". The commission said: ""The hybrid model was developed at speed and chosen as an achievable first step towards a virtual Parliament - having the benefit of meeting current technological capacity."" Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire Craig Williams said it was ""incredibly important that Parliament is reconvened"" and that MPs hold the government to account whatever party they are from. Labour's MP for Newport East, Jessica Morden, supports the changes. The party whip, who confirmed she would be working from home, said: ""There are moves in place so you don't have to be there - it's exactly the right thing to do."" Welsh Questions on Wednesday will be the first virtual session under the changes with the Welsh Secretary, Simon Hart, taking questions remotely from MPs. The Speaker Lindsay Hoyle will be in the Commons chamber along with a small number of MPs. They will be able to interact with their ""virtual"" colleagues through a number of screens which have been placed in the chamber.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Milton Keynes Hospital wedding couple reunite at home,"Elizabeth Kerr, 31, and Simon O'Brien, 36, were admitted to Milton Keynes University Hospital with breathing difficulties on 9 January. Their wedding was arranged by staff when Mr O'Brien's condition worsened. Ms Kerr was discharged on 23 January, followed by her husband on 23 February. He said they would now ""live every day to the full"". The couple, who had planned to marry in June, had to share an ambulance when they were admitted to hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels. They were placed on separate wards, with nurse Hannah Cannon suggesting to the bride-to-be, who is also a nurse, that they marry in hospital. With Mr O'Brien's health deteriorating, staff arranged the ceremony on 12 January, before immediately intubating the groom. ""When she [the nurse] came to tell me just how ill Simon was, she posed the idea because there was a very strong potential that if we didn't [have the service] then we wouldn't be getting married,"" said the bride. 'Very surreal' Asked to describe the eight-minute ceremony, which was led by a vicar, the couple both replied ""short"". ""It was very surreal, surrounded by everyone in PPE [personal protective equipment],"" added Ms Kerr. ""The vicar hadn't been fit-tested for a mask so they were in the whole regalia with the pump and everything else, to keep them safe."" However, both believed the decision to hold their nuptials at hospital gave the couple the strength to survive the virus. ""If we hadn't done it, the outcome would have been very different,"" she said. The couple said they ""could not thank staff enough"". ""We saw them work so hard and give so much of themselves to everything they were doing,"" added Ms Kerr. She added it was ""horrendous"" waiting for her husband to join her at home. ""It's driven me around the wall several times, but I'm just so glad to have him home now,"" she added. Mr O'Brien said it was now a ""second chance"" for them both. ""I've had a scare, life's too short - you have to live every day to the full,"" he added. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Dame Evelyn Glennie and Emmylou Harris win Polar Music Prize,"They will receive their awards from Sweden's King Carl XVI at a ceremony in Stockholm on 9 June. Dame Evelyn - who has been profoundly deaf since the age of 12 - said she was ""humbled and inspired"" to be awarded music's version of the Nobel Prize. Harris, a 13-time Grammy winner, said she was ""surprised and honoured"". Dame Evelyn, who played at the opening of the London 2012 Olympics, was the first person in history to have a full-time career as a solo percussionist. ""This award is so interesting, because it is recognising many different musicians from different musical backgrounds,"" she told the BBC's Colin Paterson in an interview for Radio 4's Today programme. The musician, who turns 50 this year, made her career possible by encouraging composers to make pieces for her. ""The commissioning aspect, obviously that has been the most important part of my career,"" she told the BBC at her studio in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. ""When I started there was just simply too little repertoire to sustain a career."" 'Exceptional careers' Since the Polar Music Prize was founded by Abba manager and lyricist Stig Anderson in 1992, it has honoured musical achievements and boundary breaking. Each year it recognises one laureate from the contemporary music world and one from the more classical realm. Organisers called 2015's Laureates ""richly deserving"" winners with ""exceptional music careers"". ""Both represent the spirit of the award that my father envisaged when he founded the prize,"" said managing director Marie Ledin. Harris, from Birmingham, Alabama, has recorded more than 25 albums over four decades and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008. She has collaborated with artists from Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons to Willie Nelson and Beck and is the subject of the 2012 song Emmylou by Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit. ""I was both surprised and honoured at the news of this most prestigious award,"" said Harris, 67. She told organisers she was ""now looking forward to once again returning to your beautiful country where I was first so warmly welcomed... many years ago."" 'Sound is vibration' Dame Evelyn has released more than 30 solo albums, has won three Grammys and has played with the world's most prestigious orchestras. ""To be chosen from so many deserving people, from all genres of music, only makes me want to work harder, to make a difference and to rise to the occasion,"" she said. Organisers said she ""shows us that the body is a resonance chamber and that we live in a universe of sound."" ""There's no such thing as total deafness,"" Dame Evelyn told the BBC. ""If the body can feel, that is a form of hearing. Sound is vibration, that's what it is."" Previous winners of the Polar Music Prize include Sir Paul McCartney, Chuck Berry, Patti Smith and Youssou N'Dour. As well as their trophy, Harris and Dame Evelyn will each be awarded 1 million Swedish krona (Â£78,560).",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Anne Frank's diary removed from website,"The site briefly hosted a digital copy of Het Achterhuis, the first version of the diary compiled by Anne's father Otto, which was published in 1947. It had been put online in the belief that the copyright expired in January 2016, 70 years after Anne's death. However, under US law it is protected until 2047. Wikisource removed the book voluntarily. The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia as well as Wikisource, said its action was ""an unfortunate example of the overreach of the US' current copyright law"". ""In general, the US copyright for works published before 1978 is 95 years from date of publication,"" it said. ""Foreign works of countries that are treaty partners to the United States are covered as if they were US works."" Copyright confusion The removal of the book has highlighted confusion over the copyright status of Anne Frank's famous diary, because so many different editions exist and legislation varies around the world. Under European law, books typically leave copyright 70 years after the author's death and can then be reproduced freely. Anne Frank died in 1945, which suggests that her elements of the original Dutch language version of the diary are now copyright free. ""The elements of the original, un-edited version written by Anne Frank - which were first published in 1947 - are now in the public domain in the UK, given she died in 1945 and the copyright duration in the UK for the version published then will be no longer than 70 years after her death,"" commented Adam Rendle from the law firm Taylor Wessing. However, this is disputed by Anne Frank Fonds, a charitable foundation founded by Otto Frank. It says that because Anne's father compiled and edited the initial version of the book sold to the public, he earned his own copyright, even though it acknowledges that he should not be considered its ""co-author"". Since Otto Frank died in 1980, it says that means the copyright of the 1947 edition would not expire in many countries until 2050. Furthermore, the foundation notes that Anne Frank's full, unedited manuscripts were not published until 1986, so it argues these are protected by copyright for even longer . 'Minefield' ""Copyright duration can be tricky to determine because the rules can be different in different countries, it can depend on facts that are very difficult to determine and the law as applied to those facts can be complex,"" said Mr Rendle. ""It gets even trickier when different versions have been published and different authors have had different levels of input into those versions, as seems to have happened here."" Mr Rendle also pointed out that translations of the book will be under the copyright of the people who translated them. ""Publication on the internet can become a minefield when different countries have different copyright durations,"" he pointed out.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Guides oath change consultation gets 30,000 responses","By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Guides currently pledge: ""I will do my best, to love my God, to serve my Queen and my country, to help other people and to keep the Guide law."" Guides and non-members have until Sunday to respond to the questionnaire. ""We know feelings are strong and wide-ranging,"" said Girlguiding UK in a statement. ""That's why everyone's opinion matters... ""We would like to hear from even more people - from inside and outside guiding. Please join the conversation"". Alternative wordings Girlguiding UK launched the consultation because it said it there were increasing numbers of girls and leaders ""who struggle with the wording... particularly in interpreting what it really means to girls today"". The voluntary organisation, which has more than half a million members, particularly wants to hear from the girls themselves: ""It is important that girls and women understand and believe in the words they say when they make the promise."" The promise has changed 11 times to reflect changes in society since guiding was first founded in 1909. Possible alternatives to the current wording include, ""do my duty to God"", ""be true to a higher ideal"" or ""serve the highest truth and love faithfully at all times"". The Church of England has urged Girlguiding UK to keep God in the promise. ""In a society where is it increasingly 'uncool' for young people to believe in God or any 'higher power', it is important that there are still places where they can be encouraged to explore and develop their own beliefs. ""It is important that girlguiding offers opportunities for spiritual development,"" said Canon Shelia Bamber of Sunderland Minster, a former faith adviser to the guides. Religious beliefs Last year a survey by Girlguiding UK suggested that some 70% of primary-aged girls believed in ""a god"". The figure for 11- to 21-year-olds was 55%. But Pavan Dhaliwal, of the British Humanist Association, said: ""These figures show that substantial numbers of young people do not have a religion, and other surveys such as the Citizenship Survey, the British Social Attitudes Survey and research by the Department for Education puts the proportion of non-religious even higher, at between half and two thirds. ""Those with no religious beliefs could make a hugely positive contribution to the movement if Girlguiding UK were to drop this aspect of the pledge and open up membership to all."" Alternative options for the current mention of the Queen include having ""serve the Queen"" instead of ""serve my Queen"", or ""engage myself with responsibility in the community I live in"" or ""be true to my country"". Last month, the Scout Association announced its own consultation on an alternative Scout promise for atheists who are unwilling to pledge a ""duty to God"". Last year the Girl Guides in Australia dropped their allegiance to both God and the Queen, agreeing to serve their community and be true to themselves instead.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
UK retail sales stall in April,"The Office for National Statistics said sales in April were flat on March, and higher than the 0.3% fall expected. In the three months to April, sales increased by 1.8%, with a record quarter for the online sector. ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said three-month growth was strong, with warmer weather boosting sales. The data illustrated the changes taking place on the High Street. Sales from online-only retailers rose 9.4% over the three-month period - the highest three-month-on-three-month growth rate since records began, the ONS said, boosted by promotions and sales. ""Elsewhere, department stores continued to see their sales fall,"" Ms Murphy said. Department store sales fell by 0.5% and those in household goods stores declined by 2.9%. Compared with a year earlier, sales were up by 5.2% after a 6.7% annual rise in March. The ONS said anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested warm weather in April boosted sales over the period, which included Easter, while economists said the figures showed Brexit was not having an impact on spending. ""April's retail sales figures are a timely reminder that political uncertainty is having no discernible impact on households' overall spending. The stability of volumes in April is a good result, following recent strong gain,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Admittedly, warmer-than-usual weather - average temperatures were 1.1C above their 1970-to-2018 April average - probably temporarily stimulated clothing sales,"" he added. Duncan Brewer, retail partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said sales were boosted ""as consumers went out and spent money over the sunny holiday period"". But, he said, that contrasted to ""continued bad news from our ailing High Streets, which continue to be challenged by the shift to online. Retail used to be simple: consumers went to stores, browsed products, then bought what they wanted"". Consumer spending helped drive the economy in the first quarter of the year and economists look to the retail sales figures as one potential gauge for the impact on economic growth. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said sales volumes might have been weaker if retailers had not discounted over the Easter period and that growth could slow in the second quarter as household spending eased. ""And with other parts of the economy in no position to compensate, this supports our view that growth will moderate a little in [the second quarter] and remain sluggish for the rest of the year,"" she said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Paul Cleeland: âNon-disclosureâ claim over 1972 murder,"By Tanya GuptaBBC News Paul Cleeland has made a fresh request to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to revisit his case. He served 26 years for the murder of Terry Clarke in Hertfordshire in 1972. The claims were made during a judicial review bid but a judge said they should be dealt with separately. The CCRC said it would consider the application. Suspected gangland boss Mr Clarke was shot in Stevenage after returning home from a bar on 5 November. Cleeland, of Folkestone, insisted he was at home with his wife when Mr Clarke was killed. During the judicial review bid, Cleeland's legal team claimed retired judge John May received evidence on the case as early as 1992 as part of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice (RCCJ) - an inquiry that followed a series of high-profile miscarriages of justice including the Birmingham Six. Edward Fitzgerald QC, Cleeland's barrister, also said the CCRC investigated the work of forensic Scotland Yard firearms expert John McCafferty on Cleeland's case in 2001. He wrote neither development was disclosed to the Appeal Court in 2002, when Cleeland's second appeal failed. Mr Justice Lavender said the new allegations could be dealt with more expeditiously if Cleeland either issued a separate application, or invited the CCRC to take a decision in light of the claims. Cleeland is seeking a judicial review of a decision by the CCRC not to refer his case to appeal. The CCRC said it could not comment on the judicial review proceedings, but a CCRC spokesman said: ""We can confirm that we have recently received a further application from Mr Cleeland. ""We will consider this application in due course and determine whether it raises anything new that is relevant to the safety of Mr Cleeland's conviction."" Cleeland's solicitor Ricky Arora urged the CCRC to expedite the application. He told them Cleeland was now 79 and of ""failing health"". Inquiries have been made by Cleeland's MP Damian Collins, the Home Office and the BBC about archives on the case. The BBC has accessed several files under freedom of information from Sir John May's RCCJ archive, at The National Archives. However, it has not been possible to view them during coronavirus lockdown and the BBC has not yet established what they contain. Mr Collins submitted a series of written questions to the Home Secretary and was told the Home Office is reviewing what material exists. The CCRC confirmed it also held an archive on Cleeland. Home Office minister Kit Malthouse said the CCRC files were being transferred to the department and examined. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

New name plan in Welsh ambulance shake-up,"A consultation document says the new body would be called the Welsh Emergency and Clinical Services NHS Trust. It follows a review of how the service operates in Wales earlier this year. The health minister believes the new name better reflects the emergency response and wider range of services on offer from the trust. A Chief Ambulance Services Commissioner post would also be created, with the job of advising local health boards about ambulance services. The new consultation follows a turbulent period for the Welsh ambulance service. Last month was the first time since May 2012 that ambulance crews met targets to reach 65% of the most serious emergencies within eight minutes. An investigation last week by the BBC also revealed that patients in Wales wait longer on average than others in the UK to be transferred to A&E departments from an ambulance. Local control Under the new plans, the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust would be renamed, with local health boards asked to establish an 'Emergency Ambulances Services Committee'. The new committee would effectively hand control of ambulance services to the health boards, allowing them to set the level of service they need in each area of Wales. That role is currently carried out by a body known as the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC), which is also responsible for providing a wide-range of other services. ""The Welsh government believes removing the responsibility for commissioning ambulance services from WHSSC, commissioners of over 90 different types of services, and placing it with the new Emergency Ambulance Services Committee, specifically tasked with focusing on robustly planned commissioning Emergency ambulance services, is the most effective approach for Wales,"" states the consultation document. In addition, the new chief commissioner post would be appointed. The government says the post would be the first of its kind in Wales, both advising health boards and policing how their policies are implemented. 'Greater understanding' ""The Chief Ambulance Services Commissioner will be responsible for monitoring the ambulance services' performance against national standards and take action if the Trust does not meet agreed standards,"" added the consultation. ""The Welsh government believes ambulance service staff should be empowered to deliver high quality, clinically-effective, evidence-based services which deliver far more than a transport service for life-threatened patients."" It is also argued that a new name for the trust reflects the wide-range of service already provided by ambulance staff, including clinical triage over the phone, pre-hospital medicine by specialist doctors, and 'treat-at-scene' services that avoid the need for hospitalisation. Health Minister Mark Drakeford believes a new name will better describe the emergency response and clinical service being provided. ""The Welsh government believes the 'Welsh Emergency and Clinical Services NHS Trust' reflects the range of clinical services delivered by trust staff, and will engender a greater understanding of when to appropriately access the service among the public."" The public consultation is open until 13 February, 2014.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Man 'distraught' amid hospital death payout,"By Michele PaduanoBBC Midlands health correspondent Laura Elwell had acute pancreatitis when admitted to Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital in 2014. A report claimed the sepsis patient had been subjected to ""staggering"" failure. The trust running the site said it had been ""a difficult time for the family"" and offered its condolences. Following a court settlement on Tuesday, Ms Elwell's partner Steve Smalley, who has brought up their two young children, says he is disgusted it has taken six years for ""justice"", adding he wants an official apology. According to an independent report by surgeon Richard Charnley, which was commissioned by lawyers acting on behalf of the family, malnutrition was among 12 alleged breaches of care by the hospital. Ms Elwell, from Wednesfield, was first admitted to New Cross in May 2014 when her children were aged three and six months. She was discharged twice before going into hospital for a third time on 16 July. Mr Charnley said it was a failure to not readmit her sooner, and described it as ""staggering and a gross breach of duty"". After the readmission, Ms Elwell continued to deteriorate, according to the report, because the hospital neglected to insert larger drains for her infection. She was eventually transferred to University Hospital Coventry on 5 August but, the report said, had no notes for two days which further delayed her treatment. Mr Charnley concluded that with proper care, given earlier, Ms Elwell would not have died on 10 August in Coventry. A spokesperson for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust said: ""Laura received treatment for acute pancreatitis at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton from May 2014. Sadly, Laura died in August 2014. ""Previously, the trust and the family's advisors had obtained advice from independent experts who had reached differing opinions as to the standard of care that Laura had received. ""Notwithstanding these differences, the parties engaged in mediation and subsequently a settlement was agreed which was approved by the court on Tuesday 22 September 2020. ""We recognise that this has been a difficult time for the family and we would like to reiterate our condolences."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Millicent Fawcett to be first woman statue in Parliament Square,"The equal rights campaigner who dedicated her life to getting the women's vote, will stand alongside Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Theresa May said Dame Millicent ""continues to inspire the battle against the injustices of today"". All 11 statues in the central London square are currently men. The new statue will be funded using the Â£5m fund announced in this year's spring Budget to celebrate next year's centenary of the first British women to get the vote. Millicent Fawcett formed the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1897. The organisation used peaceful tactics to campaign, including non-violent demonstrations, petitions and the lobbying of MPs. Born out of the suffragist movement came the suffragettes - the more radical and militant group led by Emmeline Pankhurst. Dame Millicent died in 1929, a year after women were granted the vote on equal terms to men. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""It is right and proper that she is honoured in Parliament Square alongside former leaders who changed our country. ""Her statue will stand as a reminder of how politics only has value if it works for everyone in society."" Dame Millicent's legacy continues today through the women's rights charity, the Fawcett Society. Welcoming the announcement, chief executive Sam Smethers called it a ""fitting tribute"". ""Her contribution was great but she has been overlooked and unrecognised until now. By honouring her we also honour the wider suffrage movement,"" she said. Ms Smethers also acknowledged the work of activist Caroline Criado-Perez, who launched the campaign for a suffrage statute. ""This statue is also a tribute to her and a testament to what one woman can achieve on behalf of all women,"" Ms Smethers said. Writing on Twitter, Ms Criado-Perez said: ""Delighted with such a decisive response from (the prime minister) to our campaign. ""Huge thank you to everyone who supported the campaign from the beginning.""

NÃ³ra Quoirin: 'Compelling evidence' of abduction,"NÃ³ra Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast, disappeared from her room at the Dusun resort on 4 August 2019. Her body was found 10 days later about 1.6 miles (2.5km) away. Earlier this month a coroner ruled that she died as a result of misadventure, but her family said they were ""utterly disappointed"" with the verdict. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÃ, NÃ³ra's mother Meabh said there is ""compelling evidence"" that her daughter was abducted. NÃ³ra, who was born to Irish-French parents, lived with her family in London and was understood to be in Malaysia on an Irish passport. She was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. Since her disappearance, her parents have believed that she was abducted. They have always maintained that wandering off was not something they could imagine their daughter doing. Meabh Quoirin told RTÃ: ""One of the most compelling things that we found out was that in a relatively small area, the plantation where NÃ³ra was eventually found, there was vast numbers of specialist personnel deployed to find NÃ³ra. ""Not only that, on four different occasions, trained personnel went to the plantation area and searched it and, in fact, some officers were even in the precise location NÃ³ra's body was recovered. ""They had all reported that there were no signs of human life at any point. That for us is compelling evidence to say that she was not there by herself."" Mrs Quoirin added that ""there was a lack of evidence around DNA and prints"". She said that when the family went to the inquest, ""we had a lot of unanswered questions and while many of those questions cannot be answered, we actually found out a great deal about what went on during those 10 days when NÃ³ra was missing"". ""In fact we felt it really strengthened our case, our belief, that NÃ³ra was abducted and we found some compelling evidence to support our view on that."" Mrs Quoirin added that her daughter ""was not physically or mentally capable"" of leaving the chalet via the window. ""Not only that - we also learned that none of her fingerprints could be found on the window and yet other unidentifiable prints were found on that window.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Parkinson's skin-swab test 'in sight',"Studies with volunteers show it can quickly detect tell-tale compounds in sebum - the oily substance that protects the skin. People with Parkinson's can have higher than usual concentrations of these. Researchers discovered this after a woman amazed doctors with her ability to detect Parkinson's through smell. Retired nurse Joy Milne, 68, from Perth, noticed the ""musky"" smell on her husband, Les, years before his Parkinson's diagnosis. She has been helping scientists at the University of Manchester explore the link. And a blinded test of her odour-detecting skills found she was 100% accurate. The research team moved on to using a mass-spectrometry machine to detect the compounds. And they now have data from 500 people, showing the skin test can correctly distinguish those with Parkinson's more than eight out of every 10 times. Investigator Prof Perdita Barran said: ""We believe that our results are an extremely encouraging step towards tests that could be used to help diagnose and monitor Parkinson's. ""Not only is the test quick, simple and painless but it should also be extremely cost-effective because it uses existing technology that is already widely available. ""We are now looking to take our findings forwards to refine the test to improve accuracy even further and to take steps towards making this a test that can be used in the NHS and to develop more precise diagnostics and better treatment for this debilitating condition."" Disease progression Currently, there is no cure and no definitive test for Parkinson's. And diagnosis can take years. The researchers are seeking funding to further develop their test, which they believe could also help track disease progression and measure whether treatments are having an impact, at the molecular level. Their latest work, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests progression of the disease comes with changes in the regulation of lipids in cells. 'Enjoy life' Daxa Kalayci, 56, of Leicester, was misdiagnosed several times over four years before finally finding out she had Parkinson's in 2019. ""I was misdiagnosed with anxiety, stress-related tremors and told that my problems stemmed from going through the menopause,"" she said. ""Despite my diagnosis eventually being confirmed... a quick and simple diagnostic test for Parkinson's would have given me the chance to start my treatment earlier and enjoy life a lot more. ""But instead, I lost so many years not being able to pursue a career as a paramedic or go back to nursing. ""This test could be a game-changer for people living with Parkinson's and searching for answers, like I was."" Related Internet Links Parkinson's UK",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Waspi campaign: The fight against changes to women's state pension age,"By Reality Check teamBBC News That effort goes back decades, so to help understand the issue here is some background. How did we get here? From 1948 for more than 60 years men received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60. But over the years it was argued that the difference was unfair, as women had a longer life expectancy than men. So under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020. But the coalition government of 2010 decided to accelerate that timetable, arguing that the state pension was becoming unaffordable. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was bought forward to 2018. Also, the qualifying age for men and women would be raised to 66 by October 2020. Those changes were expected to save Â£30bn. Who is affected? In total around 2.6 million women were affected by the 2011 changes. While some of them had time to adapt to a longer working life, for others the change came as a shock. In particular, around 300,000 women born between December 1953 and October 1954 and getting close to their state pension age, were made to wait an extra 18 months. For women who were not aware of the 1995 changes, the shock was more severe. They had been expecting to retire at 60, but discovered that they would have to wait years longer. They complained they had not been given time to adjust to the new retirement age and also that the changes in 1995 and 2011 had not been clearly communicated. Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) emerged to campaign over those issues. Waspi wants compensation for the ""unfair"" way the changes of 1995 and 2011 were implemented. It wants payments for those who have already reached the state retirement age, plus extra income for those still awaiting their state pension. But it is not asking for women's retirement age to return to 60. Critics of Waspi say it is not clear how much their demands would cost. The government has said it has already committed Â£1bn to mitigate the impact of the changes, ensuring that no one would see their pension date move by more than 18 months. It has said consistently that there will not be any further changes to the policy. Another campaign group, Backto60, won the right to have the government's actions ruled on by the High Court, but they lost the case.

Fifth of UK women decline cervical smear tests,"Early detection through screening, followed by treatment, can prevent up to 75% of these cancers developing. Yet despite high-profile cases such as that of Jade Goody, who died of the disease two years ago, many women are still not taking advantage of a test. About 1,000 women die of cervical cancer in the UK annually. But experts estimate screening saves at least 4,500 lives a year in England alone. The NHS provides free screening to women aged 25 to 65 years. The research, released to mark Cervical Screening Awareness Week, appears to suggest that many of those who have missed or delayed appointments for cervical cancer screening are doing so because of inconvenience, embarrassment or worry about taking time off work. Smear 'embarrassment' YouGov researchers asked 2,718 women about their attitude to cervical screening. Some 39% said they had missed or delayed appointments. Nearly 30% of women said they found it difficult to find a convenient time to attend a smear test, while more than a third said if their GP surgery had more flexible opening times they would be more likely to attend their appointment. Almost a third of women aged 24-35 who had missed or delayed appointments said they would rather book a day's leave from work to attend a smear test than suffer the embarrassment of explaining to their employers why they need the time off. And a quarter of all women surveyed said they would be more likely to attend if their employer was more flexible and they did not need to use up holiday for an appointment. Richard Winder, deputy director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, said: ""Unlike many cancers, cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease. ""A woman can control her risk of developing the disease by being screened regularly. ""Any abnormalities that might be found can then be treated in order that they do not go on to develop into cancer. ""Where a cervical cancer is found through screening, it is usually at a very early stage where treatment has a greater chance of success. ""It is essential that women are aware of this when deciding whether or not to be screened. Cervical screening is estimated to save 4,500 lives a year in England alone.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid-19: Northamptonshire was 'hair's breadth' from tier 3,"The county will remain under tier two rules, as it has been since England's second national lockdown ended. Lucy Wightman, director of Public Health Northamptonshire, said people should remain ""vigilant"". The government said the picture in the county was ""mixed,"" but does ""not warrant inclusion in tier three"". Northampton South MP Andrew Lewer said he was ""relieved"" at the news. The decision comes despite Northampton having the highest weekly case rate - 232 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 12 December - of any place in tier two. The town has the 89th-highest rate in England. In the latest government data, four districts in the area showed a week-on-week rise in cases, though Kettering, Corby and Daventry saw a fall. Mrs Wightman said: ""Northamptonshire, and Northampton in particular, are a hair's breadth away from moving in to tier three. ""Although it is welcome news from an economic perspective, we are asking people to remain really vigilant. ""Just because they can do something, should they?"" With neighbouring areas such as Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire, Peterborough, Warwickshire and Leicestershire all now sitting in tier three, Mrs Wightman said there were a ""number of conversations"" about Northamptonshire. She added: ""Am I surprised? No. ""I know the government is taking into consideration the hard work we are undertaking locally. ""But they do recognise Northampton was touch and go, and if we don't see considerable decline in our case rates over Christmas then we are highly likely to see changes in the new year."" The allocation of tiers is dependent on factors including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier two rules mean people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule of six will apply outdoors. Pubs and restaurants can remain open, but food can only be served with a substantial meal. Different rules for meeting friends and family will apply over Christmas. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach is due to last until March. There are exceptions for some of the tier two rules, for childcare and support bubbles. The announcement means Northampton Town Football Club will still be able to welcome 2,000 fans for their League One home game with Lincoln City on 19 December. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""The overall picture remains mixed in Northamptonshire. ""Case rates are broadly increasing across the area, but case rates in over 60s are decreasing across the majority of the area. ""The epidemiology indicators do not currently warrant inclusion in Tier 3."" It added the number of daily Covid hospital admissions in the county continues to rise and has doubled in the last 14 days.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Norfolk and Waveney mental health: Dissatisfaction with care,"The survey, by the Norfolk and Waveney Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP), said 40% did not know how to access services at all. A patients group criticised the ""inadequate"" provision of mental health care in the area. The STP said it was trying to create a better ""whole system"" approach. The STP is made up of all the larger local NHS organisations. 'Bed capacity stretched' Its report looked at care provided the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust (NSFT) - which is the main NHS mental health services provider for the two counties, Norfolk Community Health and Care Trust, Norfolk County Council social care and individual GP surgeries. The report said primary care by GPs was ""under pressure"" with doctors having to deal with 18% more patients than the national average. It said the NSFT, which is in ""special measures"" after repeated criticism from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) standards watchdog, has problems with recruitment of staff, while its ""bed capacity was stretched"". The report said Norfolk County Council's social care services had a workforce which was ""stretched and in places dissatisfied with the working environment"". 'Inadequate, poor and shocking' Mearl Brown, from Cromer, Norfolk, sought help from the NSFT after his 19-year-old son Nyall first attempted to take his own life in January. He said the care was disorganised and at one point the family were advised to seek private medical help for their son. Nyall went on to take his own life in May. Mr Brown described the family's dealings with the trust as ""inadequate, poor and shocking"". A spokesman for the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk & Suffolk, an independent patients' group, said: ""The problem is not so much the current model of care but rather inadequate commissioning, funding, management and supervision of mental health care. ""Elsewhere in the country, properly run and financed services using a virtually identical model of care to that in Norfolk achieve outstanding ratings from CQC."" The STP report made six recommendations: Melanie Craig, of the STP, and Frank Sims, chief officer of the NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups for North Norfolk and South Norfolk, said: ""It will be important to take a 'whole system' approach to improving mental health and wellbeing, working with schools, police, the voluntary sector and other partners."" The report goes to the Norfolk & Waveney clinical commissioning groups' joint committee on Tuesday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh theatre company launches translation app,"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, the Welsh-language national theatre, has developed the smartphone app called Sibrwd, which means Whisper. It will allow audience members to hear key lines and explanations of scenes in English through headphones. If successful, it is hoped the app could be adapted for performances in other languages around the world. Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru has previously used subtitles, in which a translation of the script is projected onto a screen. But that was not a ""fulfilling experience"", according to executive producer Carys Ifan. The app, is ""much more creative and more involved as part of the production"", she said. ""It's not a full translation. There are quite short sentences every now and again at key moments. ""The idea is that people will take their own smartphone, download the app and then they'll hear things that we think they need to know to guide them through the play."" The company hopes the app will help it appeal beyond Welsh speakers. The 2011 census showed 19% of the Welsh population could speak the language, down from 21% on 2001. ""We want as many people as possible to access our work,"" Ms Ifan said. ""People will go and see an opera in French or Italian but wouldn't think about going to see a Welsh language piece. So it's trying to entice people to make that leap."" Sibrwd is being tested during performances of Dyled Eileen, about Welsh language campaigner Eileen Beasley, at the National Eisteddfod of Wales next week. The app, developed with digital agency Galactig, will then be put into full use for the first time with a play called Chwalfa in Bangor, Gwynedd, in September. As well as providing translations into English, the company will take Sibrwd to a conference of minority European languages in Germany in October. Global potential ""It's something we're thinking of more broadly as well, not just English-Welsh translation,"" Ms Ifan said. ""We're looking definitely towards the international market."" Sibrwd has been funded by the Â£400,000 Digital R&D [Research and Development] Fund for the Arts in Wales, which is backed by Arts Council Wales, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and innovation charity Nesta. Nesta's director of creative economy Hasan Bakhshi said the project was given funding to explore whether an app could overcome language barriers in the theatre. ""If it does, can we capture and disseminate the insights from that project in such a way that other theatre companies can use?"" he said. ""One of the things that was attractive about this project was the potential international applicability. It's not necessarily tied to the Welsh language."" The app was highlighted in a new report published by Nesta, which suggests that arts bodies should spend more on research and development and proposes an Arts Impact Fund to fast-track promising new ideas.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scotland weather: More gales hit parts of Scotland,"High winds battering the coast are expected to ease as an area of low pressure continues to move across northern parts of the country. Flood alerts and warnings have been issued in many regions due to high seas and heavy rainfall across the country. Yellow Met Office ""be aware"" warnings of high winds were in force for some parts of the country. They included the Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland and Argyll and Bute. The storm peaked between 14:00 and 16:00 with wind speeds of 70mph recorded in the Outer Hebrides at South Uist and Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. The village of Aultbea in Wester Ross was buffeted by gusts of 62mph and Inverbervie in Aberdeenshire was hit by winds of between 50mph and 60mph. Flood alerts - warning of the possibility of flooding - will remain in force overnight for coastal areas in the north and west. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said gales and large waves could result in flooding at high tide. It also put flood warnings in place for parts of Tayside where flooding was expected due to rivers running high. Drivers were urged to take care with the possibility of fallen trees and surface water on the roads. Stormy conditions caused widespread disruption throughout the country on Saturday. Gusts of 60-70mph swept across some areas, with Traffic Scotland warning drivers of crosswinds and falling trees and debris. A number of ferry services on the west coast were cancelled. Flooding and problems with overhead wires affected some ScotRail lines and some football matches were called off. Bridges were also affected, with the Forth, Tay, Skye and Kessock road bridges closed for a period to high-sided vehicles. Wind speeds of 66mph were recorded at Inverbervie in Aberdeenshire and Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway, while a gust of 65mph hit South Uist in the Outer Hebrides. On higher ground, wind speeds reached 102mph on the Applecross peninsula in Wester Ross and 111mph at Tomintoul in the Cairngorms National Park.

Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show,"The adult film star was expected to be one of the housemates this series, which started on Thursday night. But she pulled out at the last minute, and her lawyer said producers ""tried to script a result"" that she wouldn't go along with. He added: ""They can make up any story they want, but that's what happened."" The adult film star hit the headlines after alleging she had slept with President Donald Trump in 2006, which he denies. On Friday, presenter Rylan Clark-Neal told viewers: ""Five hours before the live show, Stormy informed us that she wished to simply appear on launch night and then leave."" He said that they were unable to work out a compromise with her, but denied the conflict was over how much she was getting paid, and added: ""Reports that Big Brother tried to control Stormy to achieve a specific outcome are also completely false."" But in a statement given to Newsbeat, Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti reiterated: ""Big Brother tried to control what Stormy was going to say and do on the show."" He added: ""When they discovered she was going to do her own thing and be herself, they refused to let her go on."" Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, also cancelled an appearance on Friday's Loose Women because of a ""legal situation"". Co-host Jane Moore spoke to her off camera and told viewers: ""There was a custody development with her daughter late last night. ""She suddenly thought: 'I can't commit because being a mother comes first.'""

"Australian political parties hit by 'state actor' hack, PM says","The cyber-attack revealed two weeks ago was carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"", he said. But he added there was ""no evidence of any electoral interference"". The nation will hold an election within months. The attack being investigated was at first thought to involve only the parliament's servers. ""During the course of this work, we also became aware that the networks of some political parties - Liberal, Labor and Nationals - have also been affected,"" Mr Morrison told the House of Representatives on Monday. Who might have been behind it? The Australian prime minister did not say which foreign state was under suspicion, adding he would not provide additional detail on ""operational matters"". The Australian government has faced a number of cyber-attacks in recent years, some of which have been attributed in local media to nations such as China. Fergus Hanson, cyber security expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, put China ""at the top"" of the list of suspects but said he ""wouldn't rule out"" Russia also being responsible. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations were ""groundless"" and ""made up out of thin air with ulterior motives"". He urged media organisations to ""stop the words and actions"" that can harm ""China's bilateral relations with relevant countries"". How extensive was the hack? The Australian Cyber Security Centre said that although party systems had been compromised, it was not yet known if information had been stolen. Mr Morrison, who leads the Liberal-National coalition, said: ""We have put in place a number of measures to ensure the integrity of our electoral system."" He added that security officials had briefed the nation's electoral bodies and would provide support to all political parties. Labor leader Bill Shorten said the cyber-attack was ""of grave concern"" following instances of ""malicious activity"" in other nations. ""We cannot be complacent and, as this most recent activity reported by the prime minister indicates, we are not exempt or immune,"" he said. In 2015 and 2016, there were high-profile attacks on the government's weather and statistics agencies. In 2011, senior Australian ministers also had their email systems breached. After the attack on the parliament's computer network, officials said there was ""no evidence"" that information had been accessed or stolen.

Home ownership 'overestimated by official data',"The official estimate of a 64% home ownership rate was too high, the Resolution Foundation said, as many people shared or owners had lodgers. It said official figures concentrated on households, rather than people. The think tank, which lobbies for low-income families, calculated that 51% of families or individuals own a home. It is calling for more attention to be paid to the millions of others who rent. ""Our new analysis shows that we should perhaps obsess a little less about homeowners, and think more about how the other half live,"" it said. It added that the number of family units owning their own home had peaked in 2002 and had been falling since. It defines a family unit as an individual, a couple, or a parent or parents and their children. So one household with five single adults sharing is counted as five family units under the think tank's calculations. The size of the private rental sector had been ""massively underestimated"" for this reason, the Resolution Foundation said. It estimated that 6.3 million family units rented privately. The cost of renting a home from a private landlord in Britain rose by 2.3% in a year, according to the latest official figures. This was driven by a 2.4% increase in England, with the South East recording a 3.4% rise, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. House prices rose by about 6% over the same period, surveys suggest. The ONS says that in 2015, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 27 million households in the UK. However, the Resolution Foundation said conventional housing data, as measured by the ONS, missed 5.8 million families or individuals who lived in somebody else's home. The vast majority of these (eight in 10) were adult children returning to live with their parents, it said. The same think tank reported in August that major English cities - particularly Manchester - had seen the sharpest falls in home ownership since a peak in the early 2000s. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We've halted the decline in home ownership, with the number of first-time buyers up nearly 60%, and over 335,000 households helped into home ownership through government-backed schemes since 2010. ""We've also set out the most ambitious vision for housing of any government since the 1970s, investing Â£9.4bn over the course of this parliament. Our upcoming Housing White Paper will clearly set out how we plan to build the homes this country needs."" Where can I afford to live?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn,"The start-up's flagship product, the Oculus Rift, is a goggle-like ""immersive"" headset for video gaming. It was developed with funds raised through crowdfunding site Kickstarter, and subsequent investment. Facebook's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said Oculus' technologies could ""change the way we work, play and communicate"". Investors appeared sceptical, however, with Facebook shares in New York down 6% by lunchtime. The Oculus Rift has yet to be released, but more than 75,000 orders for development kits have already been placed, according to the social media giant. In a statement released on Tuesday, Facebook said it plans to expand the use of Oculus technologies to include ""communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas"". Oculus' crowdfunding campaign raised $2.4m (Â£1.5m), 10 times the amount originally sought. It subsequently received a further $75m from investors. The Rift headset was widely heralded at the CES technology show in Las Vegas in January, where Sony also announced a rival product. The deal includes $400m in cash and just over 23 million Facebook shares, valued at $1.6bn. Oculus employees will also receive an additional $300m if the company achieves certain targets. Commenting on the deal, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow."" 'Shame on you' It is the latest purchase for Facebook, which last month spent $19bn on mobile messaging platform WhatsApp. A number of Oculus VR's Kickstarter backers took to the original funding page to express discomfort at the move, but some rallied around the decision. ""Shame on you Palmer, shame on you,"" wrote user Xod, referring to Palmer Luckey, Oculus VR's founder. ""Facebook is smart, they saw the future, just like the rest of us here, and bought it for two billion. They got a bargain,"" wrote backer Jeff McMorris.

Lorry drivers who drink coffee 'cut their crash risk',"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Australian investigators say they found the link while comparing 530 heavy goods vehicle drivers who had recently been in a crash with 517 who had not. Coffee and other beverages containing the stimulant caffeine cut crash risk, probably because they boost alertness, the British Medical Journal reported. Road safety experts stressed caffeine was no substitute for sleep. In the study, more than a third said they drank caffeinated beverages and half of these said they did so in order to stay awake. The drivers who consumed caffeine to keep them from nodding off behind the wheel were 63% less likely to crash than drivers who had no caffeine. This was after adjusting for factors such as age, sleep patterns, kilometres driven, breaks taken and night-driving schedules. Nap advice If the driver had a poor track record of crashes in the past five years this had an impact on their likelihood of having another crash, raising their risk by 81%. About 70% of the drivers in the study said they stopped for a nap when they were tired - something that road safety experts strongly recommend. Lead researcher Lisa Sharwood and colleagues from the University of Sydney say while it is clear that tired drivers should be taking breaks, it still not clear what activities benefit them most during these breaks - napping or drinking coffee. ""The varying extent to which activities such as taking a nap, drinking a cup of coffee, or going for a short walk contribute to subsequent vigilance behind the wheel are not well understood and are therefore recommended for further study,"" they say. UK road safety experts say the only real cure for fatigue is sleep. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""Driving tired significantly increases the risk of an accident so we encourage drivers to ensure they are properly rested before climbing behind the wheel. ""Drivers should get a good night's sleep, plan sufficient breaks and pull over if they feel tired. ""The Highway Code is clear that the most effective way to counter sleepiness while driving is to have, for example, two caffeinated drinks and take a short nap.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welcome to Yorkshire: Peer calls for board to resign,"The two Welcome to Yorkshire (WtY) reports say expenses claims were made without receipts and staff felt unable to speak out about bad behaviour. Lord Paul Scriven said ""fundamental change"" was needed to regain its reputation. A WtY spokesman said: ""Where we have let people down, we are truly sorry."" The company, which receives over Â£1m in public funding a year, set up the independent investigations after its former boss Sir Gary Verity resigned in March. One investigation, carried out by accountancy firm BDO, considered expenses claims made by all WtY staff over a three-year period. The other, completed by Clarion Solicitors, investigated culture, governance procedures and management. Key findings Lord Scriven said: ""These reports are damning and also breathtaking, it shows that Welcome to Yorkshire had no governance at the top, no financial control. ""It's a catastrophe for the many thousands of local businesses that work in tourism and taxpayers who paid money, it shows that fundamental and structural change now needs to take place if it's going to regain its reputation."" Following a series of recommendations, WtY said board expenses over Â£250 would be published online and HR policies were being reviewed and improved. Mr Scriven added: ""What is clear is that this was - and maybe still is at the top - a dysfunctional body, therefore I think serious change needs to take place including the board needs to resign."" Keith Stuart, WtY interim chair, said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of the organisation to those who have been affected by actions and mistakes made. ""Where we have let people down, we are truly sorry."" Speaking in June, Annie Drew, who worked as a PA to Sir Gary at WtY for six months in 2012, said her former boss ""would shout and scream and swear and throw things sometimes at people"" and felt uncomfortable with some expense claims.

West Coast Main Line First Group deal put on hold,"Virgin launched the challenge last week after losing its attempt to continue operating the route. Ministers were expected to sign the deal with First Group several days ago. But they have confirmed due to the legal challenge the contract has not been signed and ""the competition remains live"". Virgin has run the West Coast Main Line since 1997, but lost out to FirstGroup, prompting it to demand a review. Labour had also urged the government to defer signing the contract so that MPs could examine it. 'Significant improvements' And more than 165,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the decision to be reconsidered. In a written ministerial statement transport minister Theresa Villiers said: ""As a result of a legal challenge, which the government intends to defend robustly, we have not yet signed the contract with First West Coast, and consequently the competition remains live."" But she insisted ""the commitments in First West Coast's bid represent significant improvements for passengers and will provide a good return for the taxpayer."" Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron called for an emergency Commons debate on the West Coast Mainline franchise. The MP, who represents Westmorland and Lonsdale, said: ""The announcement today, that the awarding of the franchise has been suspended due to the judicial review, gives us time to have that debate."" But Speaker John Bercow turned down the request. Virgin has made an application for a judicial review of the decision to award FirstGroup the contract, and has lodged papers at the High Court in London. FirstGroup has said it wants to proceed ""without delay or disruption"" and would continue to prepare to start running the franchise on 9 December this year. The franchise, to be run under the name First West Coast Limited, would run until 2026. The Aberdeen-based company already operates a number of rail routes, including Great Western and ScotRail. The West Coast Main Line route serves 31 million passengers a year travelling between London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the central belt of Scotland. Passenger numbers have doubled since Virgin started running the franchise. FirstGroup has said it would introduce 11 new 125mph six-car electric trains on the Birmingham to Glasgow route and provide more direct services between destinations, as well as introduce improved wi-fi and food.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Richard Wadani: Austrian Nazi deserter dies aged 97,"Richard Wadani was drafted into the German army but escaped on his second attempt in 1944, going on to serve in a British-led unit. After the end of the conflict he campaigned for justice for all those who refused to fight for the Nazis. ""Through his death our country loses a great Austrian,"" President Alexander Van der Bellen said. ""Richard Wadani stood for bravery, moral courage and an unshakable sense of justice,"" the statement read. Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 - the birth place of the regime's leader, Adolf Hitler. Hundreds of thousands of Austrian men served in German forces during the war. It was only in 2009 that the country decided to rehabilitate thousands of men who were punished for desertion and seen as traitors. Justice for the Victims of the Nazi's Military Judiciary, a group co-founded by Wadani, said it was thanks to his ""tireless efforts"" that these Austrians had been rehabilitated. Who was Richard Wadani? Wadani was born in Prague in 1922. He moved to Vienna in 1938 - his mother's hometown. After the German annexation of Austria that year, known as the Anschluss, Wadani was drafted into the Nazi forces. Talking to the BBC in 2014, Wadani said his mother gave him a white handkerchief shortly afterwards. ""She said this regime must go, and she supported me when we spoke about me deserting from the army. She gave me a white cloth, for safety, when I surrendered. I had it with me for years."" Wadani served as a lorry driver on the Eastern Front following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. As he was not on the front lines, he saw ""a lot of things that people on the front didn't necessarily see: genocide, mass murder, terrible situations. And it became obvious that I couldn't keep on being part of it."" He tried and failed to desert in 1942 while serving in Russia. Only in 1944 did he manage to escape, crawling through barbed wire in northern France to surrender to Allied forces. He soon after joined the British-organised Czechoslovak Army in exile. The soldier said he faced discrimination when he returned to Vienna after the war, and says he was turned away from an employment office when he arrived in his British uniform. In 2002, he helped set up the organisation campaigning for those Austrians who refused to fight or who deserted. Austria quashed all the remaining convictions of those who had refused to fight in 2009. And in 2014, the country inaugurated its first monument to honour 1,500 Austrians executed for desertion by the Nazi regime. Though the memorial was controversial, when it was unveiled Wadani told the BBC it represented ""reparation"". ""We waited many decades for this and now we have it,"" he said. ""It is a kind of liberation."" You may also be interested in:",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Marsden Moor fire: Crews at scene of mile-long blaze,"The fire on Marsden Moor near Black Moss Reservoir and Swellands Reservoir started at 19:00 BST on Sunday, owner National Trust said. It has caused major damage and could have been avoided, the trust added. The blaze comes almost two years to the day since fire destroyed seven sq km (1,730 acres) of land in April 2019, which was started by a barbecue. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) has advised nearby residents to keep their doors and windows closed and warned people to stay away from the area. At its height, about 50 firefighters were involved, with 10 fire engines and two specialist wildlife units sent to the scene. Road closures remain in place while crews, some from Greater Manchester Fire Service, tackle small pockets of the mile-long ""flame front"", WYFRS said. Crews were ""using blowers and beaters to tackle the one-mile flame front"" near Mount Road in Marsden, the fire service added. ""We are working with Greater Manchester Fire on the flame front putting out hot spots using the specialist wildfire Argocat,"" it said. Craig Best, countryside manager for the National Trust, said: ""It's so frustrating to see yet another fire on our moors after all the hard work our team have put in to try and restore the landscape after last time. ""Although not on the same area of land as the 2019 fire, this fire has also destroyed a crucial area for rare birds and mammals, as well as carbon-capturing blanket bog. ""We're so grateful to West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service for their efforts. ""Unfortunately, this was another fire started by people and could have so easily been avoided."" Barbecues and fires are banned on the moors all year round to protect the landscape, with anyone breaching the ban liable to face a fine of up to Â£2,000. Marsden Moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest famous for rare ground-nesting birds and blanket peat bogs. It is also home to short-eared owls and mountain hares, the trust says. The trust said restoration efforts from the 2019 devastation were ""expected to take several years and cost at least Â£500,000"". Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

South West Trains 'ice delays' anger commuters,"The rail provider said ice in Petersfield, Hampshire, was causing disruption between Havant and Guildford, in Surrey, on Friday. Commuters took to social media to complain with some saying the firm should have been more prepared. A spokeswoman said weather forecasts indicated temperatures would not be as cold as they were. One rail passenger used the hashtag ""kidnapped"" after being stuck for three hours. South West Trains had said disruption, which began about 05:00 GMT, was expected until 15:00. It has since issued an apology and said delays were compounded due to signalling problems between Hilsea and Havant. 'Absolute embarrassment' Michelle Palin âsaid: ""@SW_Trains hardly the coldest morning, and we all knew frost was coming, yet you once again can't cope!! Why not prepare the rails?"" Ben Gulvin âalso tweeted: ""It's the first hint of ice how on earth is this not prepared for. Absolute embarrassment on yourselves."" Michelle Sparks said: ""Left Havant on the 0451, still haven't reached destination. No idea where I am. Nearly 3 hrs stuck on the train. #kidnapped."" Stuck commuter and Norwegian national @torarne described the delays as ""amusing"" given he was ""used to snow and ice"". ""Hairdryers to de-ice the rails anyone?"" he added. ""It's apparently the wrong kind of ice,"" joked Jamie Whiteman. South West Trains said it ""carefully monitored"" the weather forecasts along with Network Rail. ""In the winter, we run special de-icer trains to keep lines clear and these are deployed when the air temperature is forecast to be below 2C,"" a spokeswoman said. ""In this case, the forecasts we received did not indicate these temperature levels."" She said the firm would review the forecasts and its response ""to determine whether any additional preventative measures can be taken in future"". How does ice affect electrified rails? By BBC transport correspondent Paul Clifton All electrified railways are susceptible to ice. Modern trains on the third rail network - which provides power to the trains - of southern England have lightweight collector ""shoes"", which pick up the power. When the rail is icy the shoe can lose contact, shutting the trains down. Where the power comes from overhead lines the cables become heavier too. Coping with that extra weight has to be part of their design. They are a bit more reliable but when they do break they take much longer to repair, causing greater disruption. Railway engineers reckon there's little difference between the two systems in terms of resilience to extreme weather.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Taj Mahal: mud-pack treatment for pollution stains,"The treatment is hoped to restore the natural sheen and colour of the white marble monument. It will be the fourth time the 17th century mausoleum has had the treatment. The last mud-pack was applied in 2008, but pollution levels around the monument remain high and officials say it needs cleaning again. The Taj Mahal sits on the bank of the Yamuna River, at the city of Agra in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh. It was completed by the Emperor Shah Jahan in 1653 as a mausoleum for his third and favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child. The monument's complex structure of white marble domes and minarets inlaid with semi-precious stones and carvings is considered the finest example of Mughal art in India. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became an Unesco World Heritage site and attracts millions of visitors each year. But it also has to contend with pollution from the busy and industrial city of Agra and a nearby oil refinery. ""Due to increasing pollution in the city, the white marble is yellowing and is losing its sheen,"" B M Bhatnagar from the Archeological Survey of India told the Press Trust of India. Mr Bhatnagar said the chemical department of the Archeological Survey has already begun the process to make the mud-pack. The cleaning treatment is said to be based on a traditional recipe which is used by Indian women to restore a natural glow to their faces. A 2mm-thick layer of lime-rich clay will be plastered over the affected areas of the monument and left overnight to dry, said Mr Bhatnagar. ""When it dries the flakes are removed from the surface with soft nylon brushes and washed with distilled water to remove impurities sticking to the surface,"" he said. The marble mausoleum had been given this treatment three times in the past: in 1994, 2001 and 2008. ""In the last treatment, which cost around Rs. 10.4 lakh ($24,000), a team of two dozen experts had carried out the work in small sections over a period of six months to ensure that the tourist inflow does not suffer,"" said Mr Bhatnagar.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tributes paid to Rangers fans' coach crash victim,"The man has been named as Ryan Baird, from Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway. Mr Baird, who was originally from Larne in Northern Ireland, was described by his cousin Louise Evanne Baird as ""amazing"". Police Scotland said a further 18 people were taken to hospital, where three remained in a serious condition. Those seriously injured were a 64-year-old woman and two men, aged 19 and 61. Their condition is not believed to be life-threatening. The crash happened at about 13:15 BST on Saturday on the A76 by the Crossroads Roundabout near Kilmarnock. The coach was taking the Nith Valley Loyal Rangers Supporters' Club to Ibrox Stadium, where Rangers were due to play Partick Thistle in the Scottish Premiership. Mr Baird's partner Sarah Hughes, paid tribute to him, saying he had loved the club. The Nith Valley Loyal Rangers Supporters Club posted on its Facebook page: ""The club would like to thank everyone for their good wishes & concern at this sad time.""

Arctic walrus off Ireland's coast proves a rare sighting,"The rare sighting was captured by a local man and his five-year-old daughter on Sunday. On Monday, observers said there were no signs of the animal in the area. While such sightings are unusual, an adult walrus was seen on the north and west coast of Scotland in 2018. Tom Arnbom, a senior advisor to WWF on the Arctic and its marine life, told BBC News that the latest walrus looked relatively young. ""Often it is adolescent animals that venture on long trips"" to find new areas to breed, he explained. Alan Houlihan told Irish media he and his daughter Muireann spotted the mammal on Valentia Island when they were out walking at the weekend. ""The size of the thing was astronomical. It was the size of a big bull,"" he said. ""He disappeared into the sea for a while and he then came back and put himself on a rock for a good couple of hours. It was fantastic."" Marine biologist Kevin Flannery of Dingle Oceanworld Aquarium told the Irish Examiner: ""This is the first confirmed sighting of a walrus. It's a one-off as far as I'm concerned."" The Irish Whale and Dolphin group (IWDG) believe it is the third sighting of a walrus since 1999. Mr Flannery suggested that the mammal probably fell asleep on an iceberg in Greenland and woke up off the coast of Ireland. However, Mr Arnbom believes that is unlikely. Instead the walrus probably deliberately veered far from home in the North Atlantic and came close to the Irish coast to find food, he says. ""Sooner or later they have to come to the shallows, i.e. less than 100-200 metres depth, to feed on mussels or clams. They eat up to several thousand clams a day,"" he explained. ""It is lost while it is far from any friends, but I am not afraid that it will die,"" Mr Arnbom explains, adding that the walrus does not appear sick in the photographs. He says the animal will hopefully find its way home, but not before it is sighted in several other places. It is very important that humans do not get close to walruses otherwise they may get scared and try to reach the shore, endangering them, he explained. ""They are big wild animals so keep a distance."" There are about 20,000 walruses in the North Atlantic, but globally they are facing a growing threat from climate change and shipping routes, Mr Arnbom said. He added that these issues had killed thousands of the mammals in the Pacific Ocean, close to Alaska and north-eastern Russia. But in the Atlantic, walruses seem better able to cope with a changing climate because feeding grounds are closer to shore and they rest in smaller groups.

Police chief responds to Fred West 'murder victim' petition,"Fifteen-year-old Mary Bastholm was last seen alive in Gloucester 44 years ago. Gloucestershire Police is being petitioned to carry out searches at the cafe where Ms Bastholm once worked. Chief Constable Tony Melville told petition organisers there was ""simply no evidence to support the idea that Mary is buried in that location"". Petitions' claims Chris Roberts, who set up the petition on the 44th anniversary of her disappearance on 5 January 1968, said it was widely believed that Mary was another victim of West. In a detailed letter, Mr Melville said he was replying because of the ""scale of public interest"" in the case and ""at the request of Mary's family"". He answered the petitions' claims by stating it was simply ""not true"" the cafe's basement toilet was converted around the time of Mary's disappearance. He said a book found in the basement was not a school exercise book belonging to Mary but an old cafe diary with no connection to the Bastholm family. ""It is our view that any search of the Pop-In Cafe would be entirely disproportionate and without foundation,"" added Mr Melville. ""We have visited Mary's family to explain this and they are wholly supportive of this course of action."" He has requested that the i-petition be removed and said the force would not revisit this decision ""without new and compelling information"". 'Left as reminder' In response, Mr Roberts said the petition would remain but he was happy to remove anyone who wanted their name taken off. He said the issue that really stood out was the issue over the book found in the basement. ""My logic says that if it was an old cafe diary, why would the tenant report it to the police, why would the police collect it and why would they still have knowledge of it?"" he said. ""I intend to leave the petition up more than anything else as a reminder. ""If Peter Bastholm (Ms Bastholm's brother) got in touch with me I'd be happy to talk to him. If he wants that petition taking down I will do so on his word only."" Fred West was charged with 12 murders in 1994 and is suspected of torturing, raping and murdering an unknown number of women over a 20-year period. He committed suicide in Birmingham's Winson Green prison before his trial. His wife Rose was jailed for life for the murders of 10 girls and young women.

GCSE computing tasks withdrawn after answers appear online,"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter, BBC News The exam board OCR has confirmed the units will be ""replaced"" to avoid the assessment being ""compromised"". The board acknowledges some candidates may have begun or even completed the tasks but says students in this position can still submit their work. OCR said its aim was ""to avoid the slightest possibility"" of unfairness. The tasks were due to be submitted by June next year by students currently on the first year of the two-year GCSE course. The exam board says they will now be replaced for students who have not yet begun the units. Teachers' dismay The board says a school got in touch last week to raise concerns that model answers to the two units had appeared ""on a number of public websites"". ""OCR has had to act so that the assessment is not compromised and all students receive the results they deserve. ""One course of action that OCR follows if sensitive information such as this is available is to ask public websites to remove the information as soon as possible,"" says the board in a statement. ""After a school got in touch last week to raise its concerns, OCR reviewed the options in line with regulatory requirements."" Teachers first heard there was a problem with the units when a notice appeared on the OCR website on Friday saying that they were being withdrawn with immediate effect. Many reacted with dismay. However, the board subsequently took the notice down saying it was posted in error before the internal review of the situation had been completed. 'Unfair advantage' The statement continues: ""We have now completed that review - and while there is no suggestion of widespread malpractice - we have to act to avoid the slightest possibility that one candidate could gain an unfair advantage over another. ""As a result, we have decided that with immediate effect OCR will withdraw the existing controlled assessment tasks and will be replacing them for the next academic year. ""However, to avoid penalising the vast majority of hard-working students and teachers, those candidates who have completed or just started their controlled assessment tasks will still be able to submit their work. OCR's examiners will be extra vigilant when overseeing the marking process and will use a range of tools to ensure that no candidate has gained an unfair advantage.

Small businesses in Scottish council spend call,"The FSB said public bodies should be required to publish regular assessments of how they spend their cash. It argued they should also have to identify areas for improvement. The FSB called for the measures to be included in the Scottish government's planned sustainable procurement bill. The federation also urged that public contracts be designed, where appropriate, so they could be met by local supply. And it said it would like turnover, insurance and financial requirements to be proportional to the size of contract. The call came after the FSB published a study which suggested Scottish authorities on average spent less on their budget with local firms than councils in many other parts of the UK. Web portal However the report, conducted in conjunction with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, also highlighted areas where Scotland was ahead of the UK. It recommended initiatives such as the Public Contracts Scotland web portal should be emulated across the UK. Scottish councils were also commended for better data collection than their UK counterparts. Earlier this year, Infrastructure Secretary Alex Neil outlined his intention to reform public procurement to improve Scottish businesses' access to contract opportunities. The Scottish government has committed to introducing a sustainable procurement bill during the life of the current parliament. The FSB's Scottish policy convener, Andy Willox, said: ""The Scottish government's upcoming sustainable procurement bill is a real opportunity for us to decide what we want Scottish public procurement to do. ""Over and above any other priorities associated with this legislation, we believe that Scotland needs to use its public spending power to advance our economic ambitions. ""Legislation alone won't solve some of the systemic issues associated with smaller enterprises bidding for public work. ""Alongside the bill, we need to see a real push to connect taxpayers' spend with the communities it came from. We've recently seen some enormous public contracts go spectacularly wrong."" He added: ""The idea that going with the multinational is the safer option has been proven wrong time and time again and we need the system to reflect this.""

Brexit: Trade deal now looking remote,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. The talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen were difficult - the gaps between them no slimmer at the end than the start. The hoped-for mutual understanding, the nudge or wink to pursue compromise, did not come. The only agreement was on when they might call a halt. For the first time in a world of highly moveable deadlines, they announced that a final decision must be taken by the end of the weekend. 'It's dystopian' Both sides want to stick to their principles. But that determination right now has set them on the path to the practical outcome they both wanted to avoid - and, if nothing changes, the chance of significant disruption at least in the short term for the country in many different ways. And for both sides, failing to agree would be a real political accident - something they don't want, and that didn't have to happen. One diplomat told me: ""It's dystopian - the UK wants to have the absolute freedom to do things it will probably never do - apart from some tinkering. The EU wants to protect itself from things that will probably never come."" People involved in the negotiations believed that there was a way through that could protect each part. But unless one side, or more likely both, are willing to give up some of their principles very fast, or the negotiators come up with a sudden miracle, then for all his optimism, Boris Johnson may fail to achieve the trade deal that Brexiteers boasted would be easy. A result that he always said he would be ready for, but no doubt what he wanted to avert.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Suspected Tamil rebels shot dead in Sri Lanka,"By Charles HavilandBBC News, Colombo It says they were taking instructions from two LTTE leaders based in Europe. The reported incident, if true, is the first substantial military encounter since the end of the war. But civil society campaigners have cast doubt on whether there is any such revival of the separatist rebels. The authorities say they have arrested dozens of people in connection with the alleged bid to relaunch the Tigers. The military says it believes the three who died were the same three that it described as wanted men in the past few weeks. In a statement, its spokesman, Brig Ruwan Wanigasooriya, said the armed men had been shot dead by troops early on Friday when they tried to escape a jungle area where they were surrounded. Campaigner held He said the military had acted on information from local people opposed to the revival of the LTTE. He named the three as Sundaralingam Kajeepan alias Thevihan, Selvanayagam Kajeepan alias Gobi and Navaratnam Navaneethan alias Appan. The shooting, he said, happened near Padaviya, just outside the island's northern province, although earlier he gave the location as Nedunkerni in the northern Vavuniya district. The name Gobi has been in the news for several weeks but the facts surrounding him remain disputed. The authorities say Tamil diaspora groups mandated him to lead a Tiger revival. They say he shot and wounded a policeman while evading arrest near Kilinochchi last month. They arrested a woman, Jeyakumari Balendran, whom they accused of harbouring him. Ms Balendran - a campaigner on political disappearances who says her own 15-year-old son was abducted by the state - denies having sheltered Gobi, saying he was a stranger and had intruded on her home pursued by the security forces. She is incarcerated in a high-security jail under anti-terror laws while her young daughter - and fellow campaigner - is in care. Earlier this week the Tamil newspaper Uthayan said Gobi had already been arrested and brought to Colombo. But the authorities denied it. There has been a notable increase in arrests and security searches in northern Sri Lanka and some detentions in Colombo. On Thursday the police acknowledged having arrested 60 people, 10 of them women, in recent weeks. A lawyer for Ms Balendran, K S Ratnavale, said that with the reported death of Gobi his client should be released from detention, as should three other women he says are being ""kept as hostages in his place"" - one woman said to be his wife, one said to be his mother and her medical attendant.

Wirelessly charged electric buses set for Milton Keynes,"By Neil BowdlerScience and technology reporter, BBC News A fleet of eight new electric vehicles will operate along a busy route in Milton Keynes from late January. The buses can run for longer by virtue of a wireless booster charge they receive at the start and end of the route from plates in the road. The buses are the first of their kind to operate in the UK. Inductive charging The fleet will run on the Number 7 route, which covers 25km (15 miles) between the Milton Keynes suburbs of Wolverton and Bletchley and carries an estimated 800,000 passengers a year. After a night charging at the depot, the buses will receive booster charges throughout the day at the start and end of the route. There, the bus parks over plates buried in the road. The driver then lowers receiver plates on the bottom of the bus to within 4cm of the road surface and the bus is charged for around 10 minutes before resuming service. The system uses a process called inductive charging. Electricity passes through wire coils in the road plates, generating a magnetic field. This field induces a voltage across coils in the bus plates and the vehicle's batteries are charged. The new vehicles have been built by UK bus manufacturer Wrightbus and will operate as part of a five-year trial programme led by the European division of Japanese company Mitsui and UK engineering group Arup. ""Electric buses have huge potential and we're exploring how they can help us take better care of the environment without compromising passenger service,"" said John Bint of Milton Keynes Council. ""With the help of the project collaborators, we'll be monitoring the buses closely over the next five years."" Mr Bint told BBC News that if the buses proved a success, the plan was to roll out the system to all bus routes in the town. John Miles, an Arup consultant and engineering research professor at Cambridge University, said: ""These electric buses will be expected to do everything a diesel bus does. ""They will be operating on a demanding urban route, and that's all part of the trial's aim - to prove that electric buses can be tough as well as green."" Similar systems are already being used in Turin and Genoa in Italy, Utrecht in the Netherlands and in Mannheim in Germany. Last year, South Korea switched on a 12km (7.5-mile) road which can recharge electric vehicles as they drive over it, without the need for vehicles to stop at all. Two public buses are using the Online Electric Vehicle system, or OLEV, in the South Korean city of Gumi. The technology means the vehicles can be fitted with smaller, lighter batteries, reducing the amount of power required to drive them.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Lundy Island visitors return to mainland after ferry failure,"The MS Oldenburg arrived to collect 65 holidaymakers on Saturday but had a mechanical fault and was towed back. The Landmark Trust, which leases the island, found extra accommodation for those stranded in the island's lodges, campsite, wheelhouse, pub and church. They arrived back in Bideford on Monday evening. One returning visitor said ""what happens in Lundy stays in Lundy"", adding their party of nine had spent an extra Â£380 in the island's pub in the last two days. A Landmark Trust spokesman said: ""While at the Lundy jetty, a rope got caught around the propeller in a huge swell so the mechanical fault unexpectedly prevented the ship from sailing. ""Unfortunately sailing conditions prevented it returning on Sunday to collect passengers, so guests stayed an additional night."" Visitors who had to return to the mainland urgently, including an eye surgeon and a patient with a scheduled operation, were transported back by lifeboat. Evacuee Jo King said: ""They said there was a problem with the boat - they couldn't moor it properly - and they were worried it was going to break up overnight. ""They were concerned the boat mattered most and we wouldn't be going back as planned."" Mrs King and her husband Derek spent Saturday night in a room in the island's dairy. Mr King said: ""It was very comfortable. There were people sleeping in the church, and in the old barn. But we were fortunate to end up in the dairy, which was as good as the accommodation we'd paid for."" Blankets were also provided for some people to sleep on the floor in the island's Marisco Tavern pub.

Essex lorry deaths: Accused made earlier crossing attempt,"The Vietnamese nationals, aged between 15 and 44, suffocated as they were transported from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet on 23 October last year. Jurors heard how the victims had been sealed in the pitch black unit in ""unbearable"" 38.5C heat for 12 hours. Four men are on trial at the Old Bailey in connection with their deaths. Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told the court about two earlier people-smuggling trips in October last year. On 11 October, he said, witnesses reported seeing 15 to 20 people emerge from a lorry trailer close to the Essex port, and run towards a fleet of dark cars which then drove off at speed. That trailer, he said, was dropped off by driver Eamonn Harrison at Zeebrugge - and collected by Christopher Kennedy at Purfleet, before it was met by Gheorghe Nica and others at a nearby pick-up point. On 14 October, Mr Kennedy was stopped at Coquelles in France en route to Folkestone via the Eurotunnel, the court heard. His lorry was searched and 20 Vietnamese people were discovered in the back and taken away by authorities, Mr Emlyn Jones said. ""At least two of the Vietnamese nationals turfed out of the lorry that night ended up in Harrison's lorry on 22 October, and were amongst the victims who died that night,"" he said. 'Plan B' The prosecutor added: ""These particular victims had secured the services of the organised criminal network to get them to the UK, providing Â£10,000 a head for that service. ""Obviously, they need a plan B, they try again. ""So the organisers have to arrange a replacement journey - which again involves the same teams of drivers, lorries, and so on."" Nica, 43, of Basildon, Essex, and Mr Harrison, 23, of Mayobridge, Co Down, Northern Ireland, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Nica has admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. Mr Harrison, Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, and Mr Kennedy, 24, of Co Armagh, Northern Ireland, deny the conspiracy charge. The trial continues.

Golden and sea eagle decline since Dark Ages mapped,"Researchers looked at places named after eagles in Gaelic and Old English to help estimate populations of the birds in AD500. From the Dark Ages, they drew on historical material and studies to map pairs of the raptors to the present. The RSPB said the maps painted ""a sad picture of decline"". Published in Bird Study, the journal of the British Trust for Ornithology, the study suggests both species were once found across lowland and upland Britain and Ireland. There were an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 pairs of golden eagles in AD500, when Arthur was said to have been a mythical king, or a real-life warlord. By the year 1800, by which time the Industrial Revolution was in full swing, numbers of the eagles had fallen to as few as 300. According to the RSPB, up to 90% of sea eagles were lost over that same period and the species was extinct in Britain by the early years of the 20th Century. Human persecution and the destruction of habitats have been blamed for the falling numbers. White-tailed sea eagles were reintroduced to the Isle of Rum, off Scotland's west coast, in 1975, followed by other programmes to bring back the birds to other parts of Scotland. Thirty-one pairs of sea eagles and 440 golden eagles were recorded in 2003. Richard Evans, of RSPB Scotland and lead author of the study, said the results were striking. He said: ""They provide compelling evidence that eagles were widespread throughout most of Britain and Ireland in the Dark Ages. ""Between 500 and 1800 we see massive loss of eagle range in the south, which is consistent with the effects of habitat loss and killing by humans, rather than the influence of climate change on habitat, or competitive exclusion, as some have suggested. ""This trend continued in the years up to the First World War, until the only eagles left in all of Britain and Ireland were golden eagles in the highest hills and deer forests of Scotland."" Mr Evans added: ""Recovery of golden eagles since this low point has now stalled, while limited recovery of white-tailed eagles has only been possible by reintroduction. ""Although the reintroduced white-tailed eagle population is healthy, at present they occupy only a fraction of their former range."" The study drew on research of names representing the word ""eagle"" given to places when Old English, Norse, Welsh and Scots and Irish Gaelic that replaced older Celtic language place names. In Scots Gaelic, 276 such place names were found, 152 in Old English, 84 in English, 66 in Scots, 63 in Irish Gaelic, 55 in Norse, 18 in Welsh and two in Manx. The method has been used to estimate numbers of other species.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Homeless people struggle to access healthcare, report says","A third of people surveyed by housing charity Cymorth Cymru said health problems contributed to them losing their home. Seven recommendations have been made to health boards, landlords and councils to ensure better support. The Welsh Government said it welcomed the report and would consider its recommendations. The charity - an umbrella body for providers of housing support and social care services - analysed responses from 332 homeless people from 21 out of 22 local authority areas. It was commissioned by the Welsh Government to look at the experiences of people who had slept rough, stayed in a hostel or B&B, stayed with friends or relatives, or applied to the council as homeless. A third of the sample stated their homelessness was caused, at least in part, by a health problem, when drug or alcohol problems were included as part of a broadly defined health issue. Nearly a quarter who were admitted to hospital said they were discharged to the streets or ""unsuitable accommodation"". More than two-thirds of respondents had not had a hepatitis B or flu vaccination and half the eligible female respondents did not have cervical smears or breast examinations on a regular basis. Waiting times, the inability to make an appointment, as well as drug and alcohol problems are some of the factors which prevent people from accessing health services, the report said. Cymorth Cymru director Katie Dalton said the results suggested poor health was a cause as well as an effect of homelessness. ""People can start to experience a physical or mental health problem and that can impact on their ability to engage in employment - they could see their income reduce or stop, not be able to afford their rent or mortgage and lose their home,"" she said. ""We know that around 30% of people who are homeless saw their health get worse in the past 12 months and that many of them face barriers to accessing a range of health services that could have prevented that deterioration from happening."" Recommendations Ms Dalton added: ""It's really important that we think more creatively to improve those health stats in futureâ¦ this isn't necessarily about more resources - it's about being smarter. ""Significant proportions of homeless people use emergency departments and ambulances to access hospital - we believe that if early intervention was working, those people could be prevented from needing those services and reduce pressure on the NHS. ""We actually found that 63% of people who filled out the questionnaire didn't have a drug or alcohol problem - that's probably in contrast to what public perception is around substance misuse."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We continue to work closely with Public Health Wales, health boards, local authorities and homelessness organisations to ensure appropriate services are planned and delivered to meet the health needs of homeless people and those at risk of homelessness.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
JVP 'planned to kill' MP,"A senior leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Sunil Handunnetti, MP, is under house arrest by the party after he tried to fled the country, his close associate said. Sampath Dimuthu Ketipeaarachchi told BBC Sandehaya that the parliamentarian is reduced to 'a parrot' who just repeat what the JVP orders. Magistrate order Telephone providers in Sri Lanka were ordered on Tuesday by Colombo magistrate to provide details of telephone calls to Mr. Ketipeaarachchi. Welikada police requested the court order after receiving a complaint of death threats by Mr. Ketipeaarachchi. A group of people visited his house and received continued death threats over the phone, the court was told. The alleged victim, who is currently the private secretary to Minister Susantha Punchinilame, says MP Handunnetti passed all secret documents to him as Handunnetti was under threat after he decided to leave the party. MP Handunnetti was preparing to leave Sri Lanka via Singapore due to JVP's attempts to arrest or assassinate him, the associate said. Assassination attempt He added that the MP was forced to admit to a hospital in Colombo in an attempt to save his life from the JVP hierarchy. Sunil Handunnetti was later seen with the JVP delegation that met Japanese Special Envoy, Yasushi Akashi, in Colombo. However, Sampath Dimuthu Ketipeaarachchi say his inclusion in the delegation was an attempt to diver media attention from the crisis in the party over the issue. ""The MP is under party custody since 22 December,"" he said, ""And his all telephones are disconnected since 23 December"". The JVP has taken a decision not to allow any more dissidents after two parliamentarians left the party, according to the associate. No more dissidents ""The JVP has decided to either assassinate or forcefully keep any other MP who decide to leave,"" Mr. Ketipeaarachchi told BBC Sinhala.com. JVP's foermer presidential candidate, Nandana Gunathilake and another parliamentarian has left the party since the 2004 General elections. MP Handunnetti, who was reportedly under pressure to stop revelations on corruption in the government, has decided to seek political asylum in a western country. ""As a party activist, I am pretty much aware of how the party behaved in similar incidents in the past,"" Mr. Ketipeaarachchi said commenting on the seriousness of the death threats to MP Handunnetti. Not only the parliamentarian, but his parents were also threatened by the JVP, he added. The JVP leadership however categorically denied the allegations. When contacted by BBC Sandeshaya, JVP senior leader Vijitha Herath, MP, refused to comment any further. The JVP that has twice taken up arms against the Sri Lankan state, is accused of ruthlessly killing party dissidents during the second uprising in late 80s.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Coronavirus: Pubs and bars probe after Newport spike,"Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was investigating following an increase in positive cases in the area. Newport has the fourth highest Covid-19 rate in Wales, with 43.3 cases per 100,000 of the population. Heather Lewis, of PHW, said some people were ""ignoring social distancing guidelines"". ""In a small number of cases people are not being frank and honest with contact tracers about who they have met while infectious,"" she said. PHW, Newport City Council and Aneurin Bevan University Health Board have launched an investigation into the rise in the number of cases in the area. On Sunday, 15 new cases in the area were reported, bringing the total of new cases in Newport to 67 in the last week, according to PHW figures. The cumulative number of cases in Newport over the past seven days has risen to 43.3 per 100,000, the fourth highest rate, behind Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, and Rhondda Cynon Taf. PHW said people who had visited pubs and bars in the city must be ""extra-vigilant"" for Covid-19 symptoms - including a high temperature, persistent cough, and loss of taste and smell - after a number of cases were linked to establishments. In a statement, the public health body, said people should isolate and book a test immediately if they started to feel unwell, if they visited these premises during the infectious period: Newport council said it was working with the police to ensure businesses were meeting social distancing requirements. Council leader Jane Mudd said there had been a ""concerning number of cases stemming from people not adhering to the rules when socialising"".""Our priority is to protect our residents and prevent the need for further restrictions across the city - the likes of which we have seen in neighbouring authority areas,"" she said.""Again, I make an urgent plea to every resident of Newport and every visitor to our city to act now to reduce the spread of the virus."" Ms Lewis, consultant at PHW, said most people had been sticking to social distancing guidelines and co-operating with investigations into the spread of coronavirus in the area. ""Sadly, there is evidence that some people are ignoring social distancing guidelines, are failing to self-isolate when they have symptoms,"" she said. ""Our message for the public is that coronavirus has not gone away, and it can be a very serious illness - especially for older and vulnerable people.""She added: ""We must all play our part, consistently and for a sustained period of time, to protect our vulnerable or older friends, family members and loved ones."" On Saturday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething told BBC Wales: ""I'm obviously concerned about figures in some of the Gwent cluster. ""We think what explains some of the figures is that before local lockdown and travel restrictions, there will have been contact between some Caerphilly residents and people in neighbouring authorities.

Covid: Labour MP apologises for calling pandemic 'good crisis',"Kate Green was reported to have made the comments earlier this month at an online event during the party's annual conference. She told Sky News she ""really regretted"" the remarks, admitting they were ""hurtful and offensive"". She added: ""It was absolutely the wrong thing to say."" The Stretford and Urmston MP, who was appointed to her role in June, said her remarks were a ""really clumsy and awful way to say that we need to learn from a crisis."" Last week the Sun reported Ms Green told party members the pandemic had shown ""what happens when you under-resource schools, when you under-resource families and communities."" She was reported to have added: ""But I think we should use the opportunity, don't let a good crisis go to waste."" ""Particularly for those of us in Labour, let's be talking now about what this has really exposed, about the way in which we've undervalued our whole education system."" 'Hurt and offended' Asked about the comments on Monday, she told Sky: ""I really regret saying that."" ""It was absolutely the wrong thing to say, hurtful and offensive to people who've suffered in this pandemic, and I shouldn't have said it."" She went on to add she had been trying to highlight what could be done differently to make sure the UK was better prepared for future crises. Asked whether she had intended to exploit deaths from the virus for political advantage, she replied: ""People would be absolutely right to be furious if that was what they felt I had meant"". 'Out of context' ""I'm really ashamed if they do think that,"" she said, adding: ""I can't imagine what families are going through who've experienced that"". ""And I just want to apologise to them, and to everybody who has felt hurt and offended by what I said.""

Denbighshire votes for extra sites for local development plan,"They were proposed after a government inspector said insufficient land was allocated to meet the original target of 7,500 homes by 2021. A report warned the inspector could declare the LDP ""unsound"" without the extra sites. Opponents claim homes in some new locations would add pressure to local traffic, water and power supplies. Villages earmarked for more homes include Bodfari, Llanarmon, Llanbedr DC, Dyserth and Cyffylliog. The largest site is at the former HM Stanley Hospital in St Asaph where 172 extra houses are planned. Last week's flooding of the recently built Glasdir estate in Ruthin prompted concern about its choice of a location for housing and the quality of flood defences. But only one of the newly earmarked sites - at the corner of Sydenham Avenue and West Parade, in Rhyl - is in an identified flood plain. A council spokesperson said most of Rhyl is in a flood plain and given the regeneration initiatives, they did not want to prevent all new development in the town. The spokesperson added: ""Although in a flood plain, it is in parts defended [recent sea defence works completed, although Phase 3 is still to be commissioned] and as a brownfield site Welsh government guidance does not preclude redevelopment [i.e. it is not a greenfield site where the arguments would be very different]. ""None of the greenfield sites being put forward are in a flood plain."" Traffic problems The two proposed sites which have prompted the greatest opposition are those for 104 properties alongside the former Ysgol Tirionfa in Rhuddlan, and for 150 properties on two sites off Ruthin Road in Denbigh. Rhuddlan residents say any development would put pressure on local services, while people living near the Denbigh sites argue that traffic problems will be exacerbated, saying other brownfield sites near the town centre should be developed first. Speaking before councillors considered the merits of the 21 sites on Tuesday, councillor Eryl Williams, the lead member for the development plan, said: ""We don't believe it will be necessary to use them under the terms of the local development plan but we are being charged by the inspectors to find the extra spaces. ""We are damned if we do and damned if we don't in this matter."" The Denbighshire LDP examination process is continuing and further hearing sessions will take place at Rhyl Town Hall in January.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules,"The bill, which now returns to the lower house, also eases fines for some previous illegal clearance if farmers commit to a reforestation programme. Supporters say Brazil needs land for food production, but environmentalists warn of increased Amazon destruction. Latest figures show tree clearance at its lowest since 1988, officials say. After several hours of debate, Brazilian senators voted by 59 to seven to approve the legislation. It now goes back to the Chamber of Deputies, which in May voted to overhaul the Forest Code. Further amendments are expected before going to President Dilma Rousseff to sign into law. The bill poses a political dilemma for President Rousseff, correspondents say, as she aims to both support economic development but also uphold environmental pledges made during her election campaign. Environmental fears Brazil is a major food producer and the farmers' lobby argues environmental protection unnecessarily harms their sector. ""This is the first time we're ending the monopoly, that we're ending the environmental dictatorship where half a dozen [non-governmental organisations] controlled the environment ministry,"" said Sen Katia Abreu, president of Brazil's National Agriculture and Livestock Association (CNA). In a statement, the CNA said that new legislation would allow Brazil to ""respond to the world's growing demand for food, as it continues to be a leading example in the preservation of its forests and biodiversity"". But Greenpeace Amazon spokesman Marcio Astrini told the Associated Press news agency that the new code would reduce the area required for conservation, so allowing new deforestation. ""It's based on the concept that the forest gets in the way, on the argument that developed countries cut their forests, so we need to do the same. That thinking is centuries old now,"" he said. Under the Forest Code, which dates back to 1965, landowners must conserve a percentage of their terrain forested, ranging from 20% in some regions to 80% in the Amazon. Under the Senate bill: On Monday, the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) said there had been an 11% drop in the amount of rainforest cleared between August 2010 and July 2011 compared with the previous year. The government attributed the fall to its tougher stance on illegal logging. But in at least two states, Rondonia and Mato Grosso, rainforest clearance rose considerably.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australia to hold royal commission inquiry into banks,"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - would help restore confidence in the sector. Australian banks have been embroiled in scandals in recent times. Mr Turnbull had resisted calls for a royal commission for more than a year, but faced mounting pressure from other parties and members of his government. ""The only way we can give all Australians a greater degree of assurance is a royal commission into misconduct into the financial services industry,"" he said. He said the ""regrettable but necessary"" decision would also help the nation's economy by restoring confidence. The royal commission will cover the entire financial industry, including superannuation providers, insurers and financial advisers. The year-long inquiry will cost A$75m (Â£42m; $56m) and hand down findings in February 2019, the government said. Recent scandals Australian banks have faced various allegations of misconduct in recent years, including over financial planning, rate-rigging and insurance fraud. In August, the nation's largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, was accused of ""serious and systemic"" breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Earlier on Thursday, the heads of the four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank, NAB, ANZ and Westpac - co-signed a letter in which they reversed their long-held opposition to an inquiry. ""Our banks have consistently argued the view that further inquiries into the sector, including a royal commission, are unwarranted,"" the letter said. ""However, it is now in the national interest for the political uncertainty to end."" They reiterated acknowledgements that they had ""made mistakes"", but did not detail them in the letter. Mr Turnbull said the inquiry would examine responses to misconduct scandals and whether institutions had governance or culture problems. He described banks as the ""bedrock of the economy"", representing more than a third of Australia's stock market value. 'Dragged kicking and screaming' Some supporters of the inquiry, including members of Mr Turnbull's government, said the announcement should have come sooner. Government MP George Christensen said the prime minister had been ""dragged kicking and screaming to this decision"". Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten accused Mr Turnbull of letting ""the rorts and rip-offs continue for more than 18 months"". In explaining his previous opposition to an inquiry, Mr Turnbull said the government had already taken recent measures to make the banking system more accountable. These included forcing industry chiefs to appear regularly before parliamentary committees, increasing regulatory powers, and imposing a A$6.2bn levy on the five biggest banks. Mr Turnbull said he had believed that confidence could be damaged by an inquiry, but it was now more important to resolve the debate definitively. In a description aimed at international markets, the government stressed that Australia's banks remained ""unquestionably strong"" in the current regulatory environment. The inquiry has the approval of the central Reserve Bank of Australia and industry regulators.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Hexham BID business levy to be scrapped over 'retaliation' fears,"Directors of the Hexham Business Improvement District (BID) said they had instructed Northumberland County Council to wind up the company. It has been beset by problems since it was launched in 2016. Last year about 150 firms in the area refused to pay. A total of 232 out of the town's 650 registered businesses took part in a 2016 vote, with 66% of those opting in favour of creating a BID. Firms were expected to contribute up to Â£10,000 a year each with the funds spent on improvements in the town. 'Upsetting allegations' Announcing their decision to scrap the venture, the BID directors said a ""small minority had no other motive than the destruction"" of the organisation. They said opponents had made ""a series of untrue and often deeply upsetting accusations"" and were ""picking out directors and staff for individual attacks whilst looking to encourage boycotts of any director's business"". ""The perception is that no-one involved in business can join the BID board for fear of vicious retaliation to themselves and their business,"" their statement added. Garage owner Paul Robbie, who opposed the scheme, said it had been ""the most divisive thing that's come to Hexham"". ""I would've have had to pay Â£2,000 over five years on an industrial estate where I wouldn't see any benefit from it."" Asked whether threats had been made, Mr Robbie added: ""There have been things said in the past, there have been things said on social media, not all of which I agree with but it's been a two-way street. ""I'm a working man. Some of the terminology that we use doesn't sit with people who've been trained in how to speak PC [politically correct] and government-speak. ""I'm not quite sure I'd call it vicious. It works both ways."" Councillor Richard Wearmouth, cabinet member for economic development at Northumberland County Council, said: ""It has become clear for a variety of reasons that a BID cannot at present work for Hexham and the council will now work with all parties to appropriately terminate the arrangement.

Casualties from cluster munitions doubled in 2016,"A new report by the Cluster Munition Coalition found 971 people were killed or injured globally last year, with 860 of them in Syria and 38 in Yemen. Almost all were civilians and most were caught up in cluster munition attacks. Cluster munitions open in the air to release small bomblets over a wide area that often fail to detonate on impact. The unexploded remnants pose the same danger as landmines until cleared. An international treaty prohibiting the use of cluster munitions and requiring the destruction of stockpiles came into force in 2010 and has been ratified by 102 state parties. Another 17 countries have signed but not yet ratified the convention. The Cluster Munition Monitor 2017 report says the 971 cluster munition causalities identified last year was the second-highest figure since reporting began in 2009. Most of the casualties - 837 in Syria and 20 in Yemen - occurred during new attacks, while more than 100 were known to have been killed or injured globally by previously unexploded bomblets. In Laos, all of the 51 casualties recorded in 2016 were the result of landmine-like remnants of munitions that were dropped on the country in the 1960s and 1970s. ""The only sure way to end this insidious menace is to have all states embrace and adhere to the international ban on these weapons,"" said Jeff Abramson, co-ordinator of the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor initiative. ""The humanitarian devastation caused by cluster munitions is particularly acute in Syria, where use has continued unabated since mid-2012."" At least 238 attacks were recorded by activists, journalists, first responders and medics in opposition-held areas across Syria between August 2016 and July 2017. The report says cluster munitions were being used by the Syrian military ""in co-operation with Russia"", which launched an air campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assad in September 2015. Russia has not explicitly denied any involvement in cluster munition attacks in Syria, but has said the munitions are being used in accordance with international law and not indiscriminately. In Yemen, the number of cluster munition attacks by the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government in its war against the rebel Houthi movement declined last year following widespread international condemnation, according to the report. The coalition has said they are only used against ""legitimate military targets"". The report said that during 2016 three state parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions destroyed 56,000 cluster munitions and 2.8 million submunitions, meaning 97% of all cluster munitions declared as stockpiled have been destroyed. Operators surveyed and cleared at least 88 sq km (34 sq miles) of contaminated land worldwide last year, resulting in the destruction of 140,000 submunitions.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories?,"James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent@BBCJLandaleon Twitter Britain has 14 overseas territories. They are mostly former colonies and are located all over the world, from Gibraltar and the Falklands to Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. Most are largely self-governing with their own constitutions and governments. But the people who live there are British citizens, the Queen is their head of state and Britain is responsible for their defence and security. As such, the UK government has a clear duty to protect the citizens of these territories from natural disaster. Defence cuts In a white paper, published in June 2012, the Foreign Office declared: ""The protection of the overseas territories and their people is one of the UK government's most important responsibilities."" It continued: ""The main threats to the territories are hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis. ""The emergency services in a small territory can be overwhelmed by a major incident. The UK government recognises its responsibility to support a territory facing a disaster."" The Royal Navy used to have a permanent presence in the Caribbean. This could involve a frigate and a tanker and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship. These days, as a result of defence cuts, an RFA ship is sent only for the hurricane season between May and November. This year RFA Mounts Bay was deployed, pre-loaded with humanitarian aid, marines and engineers. The islands' governors - who are appointed by the Queen - are responsible for co-ordinating the immediate disaster response. They all have to do specialist training in disaster management. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also organises pre-hurricane seminars with the Caribbean territories and periodically reviews their disaster management capabilities. Permanent bases The UK government has been accused of failing to act as quickly as France and the Netherlands following Irma. British officials reject this, insisting the deployment of RFA Mounts Bay was planned to deal with just such a natural disaster. They also say there is no point rushing in with immediate humanitarian aid without first assessing the need. They have sent in experts to do just that. Officials also point out that unlike the UK, both France and the Netherlands have substantial numbers of troops based permanently in the Caribbean which makes them easy to deploy to affected islands. France has more than 2,000 military personnel in French Guyana and more than 1,000 in the Caribbean, centred on a naval base in Martinique. They have two frigates in the region with helicopters. The Dutch also have hundreds of troops stationed permanently in the Caribbean islands along with two naval vessels.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk linked to skin tears',"Doctors say small tears in the skin from shaving or trimming could make it easier for infections to take hold. But they also say groomers - particularly extreme ones - tend to be more sexually active too. STIs are passed on through unprotected sex or genital contact. The findings come from a survey of more than 7,500 American adults, published in Sexually Transmitted Infections - a specialist BMJ journal. The report, led by doctors from the University of California, San Francisco, said the two most likely explanations for the link between grooming and STIs were micro-tears in the skin, which increased the risk of viral STIs, and groomers being more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour with more sexual partners. Extreme cut An electric razor was the most common tool used for pubic grooming among men, while a manual razor was more common among women. About one in five men and women used scissors. The researchers said it was unlikely that sharing grooming tools was an issue, because traces of the most common STIs had not been found on objects before. But they did say doctors should advise groomers to cut back a little on their grooming or put off having sex until the skin had healed completely. Almost three-quarters of respondents said they had groomed their pubic hair before, with 84% of women and 66% of men saying they had trimmed, shaved or waxed in the past. Among the groomers, 17% described themselves as ""extreme"" - removing all hair at least once a month - and 22% as ""high frequency"" - trimming daily or weekly. Lice protection In the survey, any type of grooming was linked to an increased risk of having a sexually transmitted infection. And the more frequent and extreme the grooming, the greater the risk. Those with the most extreme habits were three to four times more likely to contract an STI, particularly infections from skin to skin contact such as herpes and HPV (human papillomavirus). But there was good news for groomers too - because their habit was found to protect against pubic lice. The report said: ""If grooming is found to protect against lice, individuals at risk for pubic lice could be counselled to remove their pubic hair."" What are STIs? How to reduce the risk?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Term-time holiday outlook - what might change?,"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter However, they maintain the policy to reduce school absence is ""clear and correct"" and they also plan to strengthen the statutory guidance on the issue to schools and local authorities. It was changes to the statutory guidance which tightened up the regulations in 2013, limiting head teachers on whether they could authorise holiday in term-time and opening the way to the mass fining of parents. The Jon Platt case hinged on the definition of what constitutes ""regular"" school attendance but although the judges rejected the definition put forward by the government, it did not determine an alternative. According to Isle of Wight Council, the ruling has created ""massive uncertainty"". Council leader Jonathan Bacon said it could imply that parents can take children out of school on holiday for up to three weeks each year and that would have a detrimental effect on their education. He said the government should urgently consider creating clear legislation. 'Freedom' But Julie Robertson at Simpson Millar solicitors welcomed the decision, saying it would give parents the freedom ""to continue to take their children out of school during term-time provided that they secure regular attendance on the whole"". ""It is a redefinition of how the law regarding non-attendance at school is applied and that's a good thing,"" she said. ""It is simply impossible to provide a percentage figure for which level of attendance is considered regular. ""Prosecuting parents does not in any way help children to learn,"" added Ms Robertson. And Daniel Jackson, education specialist at Slater and Gordon, said Mr Platt had gained a lot of support with the prominent publicity of his case and the fact that he had won would give people being prosecuted ""a stronger argument now"". He said that the relevant section of the Education Act mentioned the word ""regularly"" countless times without defining exactly what it meant. ""I think re-legislation could be something that is worth looking into,"" said Mr Jackson. Modern life For the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales education is of the ""utmost seriousness"". But, said a spokesman, the current system ""does not always favour families, especially those that are struggling to meet the demands of modern life and have unconventional work commitments"". ""It shouldn't be that a tragedy has to befall a family for a child to get leave during term-time. ""There are many more joyous and positive occasions in life when consideration should be given to granting leave requests, such as a wedding or perhaps a sporting event involving a family member."" ""These can have social and emotional benefits which are of lasting value and support to young people. And there are just times when a family should be able to come together to celebrate without worrying about prosecution or being fined. ""We want to work with the government to find a sensible solution whereby every family has the option to spend time together.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Manchester homeless man's shock at Spice use in city,"In the space of a year, William Nicholson said he has noticed a marked rise in use of the formerly legal drug. Mr Nicholson, who spent six months in Manchester in 2016 before returning this year, fears the city could become ""the most unsafe place in Britain"". His comments come following a spike in hospitalisations relating to the drug. Earlier this year, homeless charity Lifeshare claimed 95% of Manchester's homeless community were taking the form of synthetic cannabis, which appears to freeze those who smoke it - leaving them in a zombie-like state. Some samples of the drug in Manchester were ""10 times more potent than normal"", an academic has said. Mr Nicholson said he has been ""shocked and afraid"" by how many of his friends have begun using the drug. He told BBC Radio Manchester: ""It's on to the homeless and it's gripped 99.9% of them. It'll start hitting the suburbs and before you know it the kids are going to be on it."" The Scot, who returned to Manchester with his terminally-ill wife, said: ""It's all I've seen, people I met last year, 15 or 16 stone, now seven or eight stone. ""They've turned into skeletons. Dancing in the streets in the rain, just a pair of shorts on, shadow boxing. Just complete zombies."" Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has it was ""absolutely committed"" to tackling spice use and dealing in Manchester city centre and has increased the number of specially-trained officers dealing with the issue. Insp Phil Spurgeon from GMP said: ""Since January we have dealt with 92 crimes for possessing Spice, and have made 11 arrests as a result."" The force has also been working with Manchester City Council's adults and children's services, rough sleeper and outreach teams, local charities, as well as North West Ambulance Service and the NHS. 'Real epidemic' Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has also called for more public funding to tackle the problem. However, Mr Nicholson, who carries a sign reading, ""We are not Spice heads, just unlucky in life"", said people should not assume all rough sleepers are hooked. ""Everybody's tarring us with the same brush. I'm not a Spice head. Why would I want that in my life, to be in that state?"" he said. ""In a year's time you're going to read in the headlines that Manchester is probably the unsafest place to go in Britain. ""It's going to take over your city. You've got a real epidemic on your hands here. ""Somebody has got to put their hand in their pocket and say, if we don't stop it now we're going to regret it for years to come.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tyne and Wear Metro strike: Commuters and shoppers affected,"The network has been brought to a standstill after talks between operator Nexus and the RMT union broke down. Nexus has apologised to passengers and local bus companies have pledged to put on additional services. The strike comes on what are traditionally two of the busiest shopping days before Christmas. All of the 60 stations were out of action, leaving passengers having to find alternative routes to work. Bus companies, Stagecoach, Go North East and Arriva said they planned to make extra capacity available on major routes. Bus companies, Stagecoach, Go North East and Arriva said they planned to make extra capacity available on major routes. Metro Services Director Chris Carson branded the strike as ""totally unjustified"", adding drivers had been offered a 15% pay rise. But the RMT union denied that and claimed any pay rise was linked to a change in its members' terms and conditions. General secretary Mick Cash described support for the strike from members as ""rock solid"". He said: ""The company attitude shows nothing but contempt for our reasonable and justifiable claim which would provide flexibility for the introduction of the new rolling stock whilst seeing a fair increase in salary levels and a reduction in the working week."" Some people took to social media to vent their anger at the RMT, while others defended the right to strike. Andrea, who works at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, said she had to start her journey an hour early from South Shields to make her shift. She told BBC Newcastle she was ""very unhappy"" about the disruption, adding: ""Obviously we have clinics and patients coming in and we don't know how all this is going to affect their journeys. ""The journey back won't be any better so I don't know what time I'll eventually get home."" Martijn Gilbert, managing director at Go North East, said: ""We appreciate that buses will be busier than normal as a result of the industrial action, so we're boosting capacity in key areas to minimise disruption and allow as many people as possible to travel.""

Virus rebuilds heart's own pacemaker in animal tests,"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals and if these go awry the consequences can be fatal. Scientists injected a genetically-modified virus into guinea pigs to turn part of their heart into a new, working pacemaker. The study was published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. A human heart is made up of billions of cells, but researchers say fewer than 10,000 are responsible for controlling the heartbeat. Age and disease can lead to problems such as the heart pumping too fast or too slow - and it can even stop completely, in what is known as a cardiac arrest. The solution is an implanted battery-powered pacemaker which will jolt the heart to keep it in line. Hearty solution Instead a team of researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute tried to restore the heart's own ability to dictate the beat by creating new pacemaker cells. They used a virus to infect heart muscle cells with a gene, called Tbx18, which is normally active when pacemaker cells are formed during normal development in an embryo. When heart cells were infected with the virus they became smaller, thin and tapered as they acquired the ""distinctive features of pacemaker cells"", the report said. When the virus was injected into a region of the hearts of seven guinea pigs, five later had heartbeats which originated from their new pacemaker. One of the researchers Dr Hee Cheol Cho, from Cedars-Sinai, told the BBC he expected the same method to work in the human heart as they used a human gene, Tbx18, to generate the effect. However, far more animal testing would be needed before the technique would ever be considered in people. Dr Cho added: ""Electronic devices are limited to their finite battery life, requiring battery changes. ""Complications such as displacement, breakage, entanglement of the leads are not uncommon and could be catastrophic, the incidence of devices with bacterial infection keeps going up and, for paediatric patients, the device does not 'grow' with the patients. ""All these problems could be solved by a biological pacemaker."" Prof Jeremy Pearson, the British Heart Foundation's associate medical director, said: ""The ability to turn ordinary heart cells into specialised pacemaker cells in this way is highly novel and scientifically fascinating. ""It opens up the tantalising possibility of using cell therapy to restore normal heart rhythm in people who would otherwise need electronic pacemakers. ""However, much more research now needs to be done to understand if these findings can help people with heart disease in the future.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
"Brexit: Differences remain over trade deal, say UK and EU","UK negotiator Lord David Frost said ""wide divergences"" remained in some areas, despite progress being made. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, said there were ""serious divergences"" over fishing and competition rules. Negotiation resumed last month, after a week-long standoff in the wake of an EU leaders' summit. The two sides are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said talks were likely to continue in London next week, as the time remaining to strike a deal runs out. She added people involved in the talks suggested the continued uncertainty over the result of the US election was not likely to have an impact. After briefing MEPs and EU diplomats, Mr Barnier said the lack of agreement in key areas came ""despite EU efforts to find solutions"". He added that fishing rights, competition rules and agreement over how a deal would be enforced remained ""essential conditions"". Lord Frost said: ""I agree with Michel Barnier that wide divergences remain on some core issues. ""We continue to work to find solutions that fully respect UK sovereignty."" German MEP David McAllister, who chairs a Brexit group at the European Parliament, said it was of the ""utmost importance"" that negotiators allowed enough time for the assembly to scrutinise any draft deal. ""We met Michel Barnier and noted with deep concern that the list of fundamental divergences remains long,"" he added. In line with other EU trade deals, any agreement would require the approval of the 705-member assembly before it could come into force. Sticking points The two sides are seeking to reach agreement on limits on government subsidies for industry, to prevent what the EU regards as unfair competition with the UK. The UK has committed to agree ""principles"" for how subsidies are spent - something welcomed by the EU. However, they are yet to agree how such rules would be enforced - with the EU demanding robust powers in case there are disputes. The two sides are also haggling over how much European fishing boats should be able to catch in British waters from next year. Deadline looms By remaining in the bloc's single market and customs union, the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules during its post-Brexit transition period. This 11-month period is due to end in December, and the UK has ruled out seeking an extension. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, initially via video link before in-person discussions resumed over the summer. If a deal is not done, the UK will trade with the EU according to the default rules set by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Australia approves strikes against IS in Iraq,"Prime Minister Tony Abbott said IS was a ""death cult"" that had ""declared war on the world"" and must be stopped. IS controls a broad swathe of territory, spanning a borderless stretch of Syria and Iraq. The US-led coalition has been bombing IS targets in Iraq and Syria for the past two weeks. On Thursday, the Turkish parliament backed a motion that could allow its military to enter Iraq and Syria to join the campaign. IS militants have recently advanced close to the border with Turkey, prompting thousands of Kurdish refugees to cross the border. Turkey is already hosting more than a million Syrian refugees. The UN says the militant Islamists have committed a ""staggering array"" of human rights abuses. 'Death cult' In a widely anticipated statement, Mr Abbott said approving military force was ""not a decision the government has taken lightly"" but that ""Iraq should not be alone"" in its fight against the militants. Who are Australia's radicalised Muslims? Australia's home-grown terror threat He said the cabinet had also authorised the deployment of special forces to assist and advise the Iraqi military, with the action expected to continue for ""months rather than weeks"". ""Yes, it is a combat deployment, but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the Isil (IS) death cult,"" he told reporters. Mr Abbot said there were no immediate plans for Australian involvement to extend to Syria, nor for troops to be involved in combat on the ground. Canberra has already sent 400 Air Force personnel, 200 special forces members and six warplanes to a US base in the United Arab Emirates. The decision to join the military action - which did not need parliamentary approval - comes amid growing domestic concern about the number of Australians involved with IS. The government believes at least 60 Australians are fighting with terror groups in the Middle East and at least 100 are actively supporting them from home. Last month, police carried out raids on several addresses in Sydney sparked by intelligence reports that Islamist extremists were planning random killings in Australia. The raids, with at least 800 heavily armed officers, led to 15 arrests. An 18-year-old terror suspect was shot dead last week after he stabbed two police officers in Melbourne. Abdul Numan Haider, originally from Afghanistan, had been summoned to a police station for a counter-terror interview because of concerns over his recent behaviour. Images have also been published online which appeared to show the young son of an Australian ex-terror convict holding a Syrian's severed head. Mr Abbott said at the time the image showed ""just how barbaric"" IS militants were. What is Islamic State (IS)?",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Menzies Aviation workers face redundancy after global travel slump,"The Unite trade union said Menzies Aviation has started a 45-day consultation with staff. Before most aircraft were grounded, the company was one of those providing ground handling for aircraft and baggage. The firm said it had taken the decision with ""great sadness"" due to the unprecedented decline in air travel. The move comes after Menzies Aviation furloughed more than 17,500 jobs worldwide in March in response to the global slump triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been using the UK government scheme to keep workers on the payroll but the firm will soon have to start paying towards the costs. As a result Unite said 160 workers based at Glasgow Airport and about 150 workers at Edinburgh Airport face redundancy following the end of the consultation period. In both cases the numbers amount to half the workforce at each airport. 'Frustrated and angry' Pat McIlvogue, Unite regional industrial officer, who represents staff at Glasgow Airport, said: ""We are deeply frustrated and angry that despite the company calling for the job retention scheme to be extended so that job losses could be avoided they have still forged ahead with this announcement. ""Unite fully understands the situation facing the civil aviation industry, which is why we have been calling for a coordinated national response so that we can safeguard thousands of Scottish jobs. ""However, let us be clear, these job losses do not need to happen and this is a deliberate choice by Menzies Aviation to slash its workforce."" Sandy Smart, the regional industrial officer for Edinburgh Airport, described the development as ""bitter news"" and accused the company of ignoring calls to keep using the UK government job retention scheme . 'No choice' But the company claimed it had ""no choice"" choice but to reduce its workforce. Giles Wilson, CEO of Menzies, said: ""It is with great sadness we have taken the difficult decision to enter into consultation with our employees and unions to reduce the size of our airport teams in the UK & Ireland. ""This has been the most challenging period the UK aviation sector has ever seen and whilst a small number of flights have started operating again, we do not expect volumes to return to pre-Covid-19 levels in the near future. ""We're left with no choice therefore but to take action to match our workforce to the volumes we anticipate through the winter and well into 2021 to ensure Menzies is sustainable now and fit for the future.""

Challenge of Redcar blast furnace relighting,"Dave Johnson and Derek Thomas have between them more than 80 years' experience in the steel industry. Both spoke about the huge achievement of reopening the Redcar steelworks, which is now owned by Thai-based SSI, two years after it was mothballed. Mr Johnson is the general manager ironmaking, which essentially means he is in charge of the blast furnace. He started in the industry in 1978 and working on blast furnaces in 1992. He said ""Two years ago was genuinely one of the saddest days of my life."" 'Exciting process' He was in charge of the night shift when the furnace was blown out. ""I thought that was it. I sat in the car park and cried,"" he said. Mr Johnson said he did not think the site would reopen, but was delighted to be invited back when it was announced that it would. He said the process had been ""immensely exciting"" but also a huge challenge which has seen him working up to 14-hour days. There has been a major recruitment process and the workforce will be made up of a mixture of experienced workers and those who are new to the industry. But he said he had been able to spread the skill base sufficiently. He said restarting the plant had been a major project. ""To close down completely, get rid of a workforce and then bring it back to life. That's a massive statement,"" he said. He said the level of interest on Teesside had been ""fantastic"" and he was ""privileged"" to be part of it. ""There is something about blast furnaces. It gets into your soul if you like. I am passionate about it. I am looking forward to being part of its resurrection,"" he said. 'Real challenge' In September, Mr Thomas, who is director for the restart project, will mark 50 years in the steel industry, having retired twice. He viewed the relighting as a ""truly historic event"". He said it was hard work and demanding but had been a real achievement. Mr Thomas said the process started in May or June last year and they had achieved in months what might usually take several years. He said it had meant they had had to hit the ground running and learn as they went along. ""To accomplish this in something like nine months is a fantastic achievement,"" he said. He said among the challenges had been the amount of debris in the pipes after being unused for two years. He described the blast furnace as the ""heart of the plant"".

London taxi and private hire cab sex attacks 'at 14-year high',"Transport for London (TfL) and the Met Police revealed a 21% rise on the previous year. In 2016, 164 offences were reported to police. Figures were only higher in 2002, when there were 189 sex attacks. No licensed black-cab drivers were charged with journey-related sexual offences. The figures take into account incidents of rape, attempted rape, assault by penetration and sexual assault. A total of 31 drivers were charged for 34 offences in 2016, with 14 of them being convicted, figures show. Of those charged, nine were found not guilty and five are awaiting trial. There were 26 charges following pre-booked private hire journeys, with five of those convicted following journeys booked through the online hailing app Uber. Two of the five convictions related to the same driver. A further five Uber drivers were found not guilty and three more are awaiting a court hearing or outcome, the figures showed. A substantial share of London's private hire drivers get work through Uber - with 40,000 drivers in the capital believed to be using it. That is equivalent to about half of the city's active licensed private hire drivers. An Uber spokesperson said: ""We take any allegations of this nature very seriously, immediately preventing drivers from using our app and supporting the police with their investigations. ""All drivers who use our app in London are licensed by Transport for London and have gone through the same enhanced DBS checks as black-cab drivers. ""Our GPS technology also means that every trip is electronically tracked and recorded."" TfL said the safety of its passengers using black taxis and private hire vehicles was its top priority. ""Passengers should expect to be safe - and feel safe - when travelling by taxi or private hire and no one should ever be subject to sexual behaviour by a driver"", it said. None of the drivers who were charged with an offence currently hold an active private hire driver's licence, TfL added. What is the difference between a taxi and a private hire vehicle? Taxi's can be hailed from the street, can operate from taxi ranks and must have a meter and a fare table displayed. Private hire vehicles cannot be hailed in the street, cannot use taxi ranks and must be pre-booked through a licensed operator.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Scots NHS staff to receive pay rise denied to English,"By Reevel AldersonBBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent This is in contrast to England, where staff will not be given the 1% increase recommended by the NHS pay review body (PRB). Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil said NHS workers will be paid the rise on top of annual increments for developing professional skills. His UK counterpart, Jeremy Hunt, has said the pay rise was ""unaffordable."" Scottish health workers earning less than Â£21,000 will also receive an additional sum to increase their pay by Â£300 in total. Hard-working Mr Neil said: ""I was clear when Jeremy Hunt first suggested reneging on the 1% pay offer for NHS staff in England that we would block that move here and that we would fully implement the modest increase in Scotland. ""Today, I can confirm we'll deliver on that approach in Scotland's NHS, ensuring our hard-working and dedicated staff rightly receive the wage increases they were promised."" The Scottish government confirmed the pay rise will be consolidated - meaning it will be reflected in pensions. In a statement, Mr Hunt said the PRB's recommendations for a pay rise on top of automatic increments, were unaffordable and would risk the quality of patient care. He said: ""The PRB proposals suggest a pay rise that would risk reductions in front line staff that could lead to unsafe patient care. ""It is not possible to maintain appropriate numbers of front line staff, give a general pay rise of 1% and pay for incremental progression."" Unions in England have said the proposals amount to a pay cut for NHS staff, and have threatened industrial action. Tom Waterson, chairman of Unison's Scottish health committee, said they were delighted Scottish workers would receive the recommendations of the pay review body. ""We would urge the UK government to also commit to paying health service staff the recommendations in full. ""We went into these negotiations in good faith and we expect the clear recommendations of the pay review body to be delivered. ""It is good news for NHS staff that the Scottish government have committed to doing that."" Under the proposals a Scottish Band 5 nurse would be Â£238 a year better off than a colleague on the same grade in England at the end of the financial year 2014/15. Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the BMA in Scotland, said: ""We are pleased that the Scottish government has taken a different approach to that of the Westminster government to deliver a fairer pay award for NHS staff in Scotland. ""We acknowledge this as a positive first step towards recognising the hard work and commitment of NHS staff in Scotland and addressing the well understood challenges of recruitment and retention of medical posts. ""However this uplift, which the Cabinet Secretary himself describes as 'modest', is yet another year of below inflation pay awards for doctors and other NHS staff who are fundamental to driving NHS service change and are continuing to deliver high quality care to patient despite intense and increasing workload pressures.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1

Scottish steel task force in 'urgent action' pledge,"The announcement came after the group held its first meeting. It was chaired by Scotland's business minister Fergus Ewing and included representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as councils. Tata last week announced plans to close plants in Motherwell and Cambuslang. A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. Tata also announced plans to cut 900 posts at its facility in Scunthorpe. The industry blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. Following the first task force meeting in Hamilton, Mr Ewing said: ""Today's first meeting of the task force was a chance for all members to agree that our primary focus is to secure an alternative operator for the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants and retain as many jobs as possible. ""Tata Steel gave an update on global market conditions, the challenges it faces in its UK operations and its commitment to work with the Task Force to find a viable future for the business. ""We also heard the optimism and determination of the trade unions to maintain a viable steel industry.""

Undercover police: Legal challenge over inquiry,"Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter In a legal warning letter to the home secretary, they say one of the officers at the centre of the affair operated beyond England and Wales. They say their human rights will be breached if the inquiry is not widened. If the action goes ahead, it could delay the legally complex inquiry. Home Secretary Theresa May launched the Pitchford inquiry after a string of scandals involving undercover officers revealed miscarriages of justice, women tricked into relationships and claims that murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence's family had been monitored by police. The allegations relate to officers with two disbanded units - the Metropolitan Police's special demonstration squad and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. In each case they were deployed to infiltrate a range of alternative political movements, from anarchists to environmental demonstrators. While the inquiry's territorial remit is limited to England and Wales, at least one undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, went to Northern Ireland and Scotland in 2005, alongside environmental campaigners and anti-globalisation demonstrators. He also travelled to similar events abroad. More on the undercover policing inquiry In the letter sent to the home secretary on Friday, a formal step before court action begins, lawyers say Kennedy was in Belfast with anti-globalisation campaigner Jason Kirkpatrick and that he had helped at a number of events. They allege that a failure to investigate how this came about would be a breach of the campaigner's right to a private life, and freedom to take part in political campaigning. Mr Kirkpatrick has already been formally accepted by the inquiry as a ""core participant"", meaning someone who has raised concerns that need to be answered. He told the BBC that it was irrational for the government to order the inquiry to cover England and Wales but ignore events involving the same officers and campaigners elsewhere. ""There must be investigations in the operations of these secret police units wherever they occurred,"" Mr Kirkpatrick said. ""Unless the public inquiry's remit is broadened, for anyone living outside England and Wales, the Pitchford Inquiry is nothing but a painful whitewash."" Similar calls for the inquiry to be extended to cover Scotland have already won cross-party support at Holyrood with campaigners expected to launch a parallel legal action. Justice and policing are devolved to Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the home secretary retains responsibility for a number of major issues such as national security and terrorism. Many major undercover operations cut across the UK's internal borders and the officers at the centre of the public inquiry were largely managed by police chiefs in London. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ""The Pitchford Inquiry's terms of reference specify it should specifically consider undercover police operations conducted by English and Wales police forces. The inquiry has an independent status under the Inquiries Act 2005 and it is for them to consider evidence against the terms of reference.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Libby Squire murder trial: Accused's behaviour 'frightening',"Libby Squire, 21, disappeared after she was refused entry to a Hull nightclub on 31 January 2019 and was found seven weeks later in the Humber Estuary. Pawel Relowicz, 26, denies raping and killing her before dumping her body. Sheffield Crown Court was told witnesses had heard screams after the defendant had left the student at Oak Road playing fields. Giving evidence in court, the Polish-born butcher admitted he was driving around the student area of Hull on the night Ms Squire went missing because he wanted ""to find a woman for sex or to commit voyeurism on that street"". Mr Relowicz confirmed his previous offences of voyeurism, outraging public decency and burglaries, including stealing sex toys and women's underwear. Questioning him, his defence barrister Oliver Saxby QC asked: ""Do you accept you have a problem?"" He replied: ""Yes."" Mr Relowicz said it was ""difficult for me to accept I had a problem"" due to him having a young family and feared his wife ""would have left me"" if she found out. Outlining the defence case, Mr Saxby told the court: ""How he has behaved, what he has done - it is utterly disgusting. ""Let me spell it out. He has violated homes; he has violated the intimate possessions of student girls; he has violated intimate moments."" The barrister described the defendant's behaviour as ""so gross"" and ""extremely frightening"". However, Mr Saxby added there was ""no evidence of any sort of violent attack"" on Ms Squire. Mr Relowicz told the court he had seen Ms Squire, a philosophy student originally from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, on the pavement of Beverley Road ""crying and shouting"" and he said he ""wanted to help her"". When asked by Mr Saxby whether he had raped and killed Ms Squire, then put her body in the river, he replied ""no"" to all of the questions. The defendant said Ms Squire got out of his car on Oak Road and he drove off leaving her at the scene. But later he said he went back to Oak Road to find Ms Squire as he was ""worried about her"" and thought she had gone home when he could not see the student. They also heard he lied to police and felt bad for cheating on his wife. The trial continues. Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Yemen's Houthis step back on threats to tax aid,"The rebel group, which has controlled the capital Sanaa and much of Yemen since 2014, had said they would impose a 2% levy on humanitarian aid. However, in a letter seen by AFP and confirmed by the Houthis on Friday, the group agreed to drop the demand. Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the country's population dependent on aid. The letter, sent by the head of the Houthi aid body SCMCHA and addressed to UN official Mark Lowcock, said the decision had been taken to suspend the tax ""and not apply it for this year 2020"". A UN official in Sanaa also confirmed the decision. The news came a day after a meeting of aid agencies and major donors in Brussels on Thursday said the situation in Yemen had ""reached a breaking point"". They warned that aid distribution could be scaled down or interrupted in areas where ""principled delivery"", or neutral operations, were no longer possible. The meeting said that while both sides were responsible for issues faced by humanitarian and UN agencies operating in Yemen, the Houthi's proposed tax had triggered the latest crisis, according to AFP. A strongly word summary of the talks in Brussels, obtained by the BBC, did not name the Houthi movement, but said that the operating environment had rapidly deteriorated across the country and in the north - which is under rebel control - in particular. The statement said the work of humanitarian agencies had been impeded by delays, permits being refused and threats to staff. The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, says the Houthi authorities have made it clear they want greater control over what is the largest aid operation in the world, with one aid official who attended Thursday's meeting commenting that the statement was in effect an ultimatum to the Houthi authorities. Yemen has been gripped by civil war since 2014, when the Houthi movement seized large areas of territory across the country, forcing President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and seven other Arab states - who were alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by Iran - launched a military campaign in March 2015, aiming to restore Mr Hadi's government. The Houthi rebels have been accused of obstructing aid deliveries and distribution in Yemen, which was already the Arab world's poorest country before the conflict broke out, while the Saudi-led coalition maintains a partial blockade on the country. The UN had verified the deaths of at least 7,500 civilians by September 2019, with most caused by coalition air strikes. A monitor group has estimated the fighting has killed 100,000 people, including 12,000 civilians.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Dame Jenni Murray on why she's taking her clothes off on TV,"Dame Jenni will strip to her underwear on the ITV show to raise awareness of the importance of checking for cancer. The 70-year-old has had breast cancer herself, resulting in a mastectomy in 2007. After talking about it for years on the Radio 4 programme, she said it was time to ""put my money where my mouth is"". Dame Jenni told the Radio Times that when her agent first suggested the idea to her, she said: ""'Don't be ridiculous!... I'm not baring my one remaining breast to the entire nation.' ""And then I thought about it. The Full Monty is probably my favourite film ever. I thought, 'Come on, Jenni. You've been talking about breast cancer for donkey's years.'"" 'What's the problem?' The presenter explained the subject has come up frequently on Woman's Hour, with listeners regularly being encouraged to check their breasts. Almost one million women in the UK have missed vital breast screening due to coronavirus, a leading charity recently estimated. Dame Jenni added: ""You have to be gung ho about these things. I've had two children. I've had my hips replaced. I've had a mastectomy. I've had stomach surgery. I've had an operation on my left humerus, which I managed to break six years ago, slipping on a very icy step. ""My body has been exposed and dealt with on numerous occasions, and I can't see the point of being shy about it. It's a couple of seconds of taking your bra off. What's the problem?"" Dame Jenni has been cancer-free for 14 years now, and told the publication she dislikes being termed a ""survivor"", preferring ""recovered"" instead. Last month, she made her final broadcast as host of the Radio 4 show, after 33 years in the hot seat. She signed off her tenure by playing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem, I Am Woman. The broadcaster thinks her next eyebrow-raising venture will be a challenge - particularly the ice part - but nothing compared to what she has put her body through previously. Episode one of Emmy-winning show, led by Ashley Banjo and Coleen Nolan, is on ITV on 14 December. Alongside Dame Jenni, will be actresses Linda Lusardi and Hayley Tamaddon; and Love Island's Shaunghna Phillips, as well as This Morning's Dr Zoe. Baring all for the blokes will be rugby star Gareth Thomas, Love Island's Chris Hughes, and actor Jamie Lomas; along with singer Jake Quickenden, Diversity's Perri Kiehly and jockey Bob Champion.

National Procurement Service boss 'steps back' from day-to-day management,"By Nick ServiniPolitical editor, Wales Sue Moffatt, director of the National Procurement Service (NPS), has handed over responsibility to her deputy while a review is carried out. The organisation was set up to save money for public organisations by bulk-buying items like fuel and food. Public accounts committee chair Nick Ramsay AM said ""all is not well"". The NPS budget is only around a tenth of what was envisaged in its business plan. In the last financial year, it spent Â£234m on behalf of different organisations such as local councils and the NHS, but its 2015 business plan estimated it should have been responsible for Â£2.2bn worth of spending by then. It reported savings for different public bodies in that time of Â£14.8m, substantially lower than earlier estimates. A Welsh Government loan of Â£5.9m to the NPS has not been paid back and ministers are using reserves to meet further shortfalls. There were two critical reports about the performance of the NPS by the public spending watchdog the Wales Audit Office in late 2017. One of the reports found that just 19% of those who took part in a survey agreed that using the service resulted in a cash saving. No-one felt strongly that it had led to a saving. The Welsh Local Government Association said many authorities had expressed frustration and dissatisfaction. In September, Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford announced details of a review to refocus the NPS to take advantage of any changes in rules on government spending after Brexit. In a newsletter in November, the NPS confirmed its director Sue Moffatt would ""step back from the day-to-day management of NPS for the period of the review"", saying she would remain a commercial director of the Welsh Government with a range of responsibilities including an advisory role on procurement after Brexit. Her day-to-day management role has been taken on by the NPS deputy director Jonathan Hopkins. Conservative AM Nick Ramsay, who chairs the assembly's public accounts committee, said: ""We have had concerns about the National Procurement Service. ""The fact that we have now discovered the director has stepped aside from the operational role reinforces our concern that all is not well with this arms-length part of government, which is responsible for spending a huge amount of public money. ""There has been a lack of clarity to date and I am sure our inquiry will shed some light on the lack of transparency."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said it did ""not normally comment on how civil service staff are deployed to meet Welsh Government priorities"" but confirmed that Ms Moffatt was both the Welsh Government's commercial director and director of the NPS. He added: ""To make best use of her strategic procurement expertise while the review was being undertaken, Sue stepped back last October from the day-to-day NPS management elements of her role to drive forward Welsh Government's 'Brexit and procurement' programme, alongside a range of other priority commercial work.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Karate punching power 'all in the brain',"By Jonathan BallBBC News In a close-range punching contest described in Cerebral Cortex, experts consistently out-hit novices. Scientists peered deep into the brains of the experts to reveal alterations in regions controlling movement. These changes were linked with better coordination and speed of punch, a team from Imperial College London and University College London concluded. Ed Roberts from Imperial College London, who led the study, said: ""The karate black belts were able to repeatedly coordinate their punching action with a level of coordination that novices can't produce. We think that ability might be related to fine tuning of neural connections in the cerebellum."" To determine the speed of the punch, the researchers filmed and timed the movement of the infrared sensors attached to shoulders, elbows, wrists and hips of the people. The study of brain structure and function has been accelerated by the development of new medical imaging techniques, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The current study used a special MRI technique called Diffusion Tensor Imaging. This is useful in the investigation of a variety of brain disorders such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, brain abscesses and brain tumors. The brain contains two main types of tissue - grey and white matter. The regions controlling and coordinating movement are known as the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex and are composed of both. However, the study showed that changes in the structure of the white matter were associated with improved coordination. Changes in white matter structure have been observed in other individuals engaged in repetitive physical activity - pianists for example - and can also be induced simply by thought. In a study published in the journal PNAS, the authors showed that regular meditation resulted in white matter changes in regions of the brain associated with emotion. Commenting on his findings, Dr Roberts said: ""Most research on how the brain controls movement has been based on examining how diseases can impair motor skills. ""We took a different approach, by looking at what enables experts to perform better than novices in tests of physical skill."" Also, by looking at healthy subjects, it is hoped that scientists will gain a better understanding of how movement is controlled. One of the main diseases affecting white matter is multiple sclerosis (MS). This is a chronic degenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world. But the cause of MS remains unknown.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Respite reported for Scotland's daily newspaper sales,"By Jamie McIvorBBC News correspondent The Scotsman and The Herald both recorded very small rises in their circulations between April and May. This was probably helped by the general election and the uncertainty which followed. However their sales, 45,000 for The Scotsman and just under 55,000 for The Herald, are still down on May last year. The figures offer some hope for those looking for signs that the dramatic drop seen in recent years may be starting to bottom out. One factor in the falling sales has been the competition from dedicated Scottish editions of UK-wide newspapers. As recently as January 2005, The Herald could boast average daily sales of 80,700, while the Scotsman sold about 65,000. The Times and the Daily Telegraph both produce Scottish editions. With 24,500 and 23,000 daily sales respectively, they sell substantially fewer copies than either The Herald or The Scotsman, but have undoubtedly eaten into their sales. 'Price wars' But could the recent respite for The Herald and The Scotsman be short-lived? One question concerns price - this week both the Scottish Daily Mail and the Scottish Daily Express launched a so-called ""price war"" and went on sale for just 20p. Two years ago the sales of the Mail overtook the combined circulation of The Herald and The Scotsman. Last month the Mail sold 112,000 copies in Scotland. It is still unclear how long the two middle market titles will continue to cut cut their price. Aggressive price-cutting by The Sun helped it overtake the Daily Record as Scotland's best-selling tabloid four years ago, and that lead has been maintained even though both titles have seen their sales slip. Circulation stability Last month the Record sold more than 300,000 copies in Scotland while The Sun sold almost 340,000. But it's less clear whether price-cutting really helps more upmarket titles make significant gains. Last summer, the Sunday Herald cut its price to Â£1. A relatively modest rise in sales to about 42,000 is unlikely to have increased income, but the price reduction has at least brought stability to the circulation. The Scottish Daily Mail increasingly regards the Herald and the Scotsman as its principle competitors. Its core market might be described as Middle Scotland. Next month's figures will reveal whether the Mail's price cut has had any significant affect on its sales - and whether the move has harmed anyone else.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Essex academic's imposter 'copied work and tattoos',"Matt Lodder, senior lecturer in art history at the University of Essex, has carried out wide-ranging work into the history of tattooing practice. The unnamed imposter, he said, went as far as to present his work at conferences. Mr Lodder said it was ""pretty creepy"". The 40-year-old said the imposter, who was studying for a masters degree in the US, used a variety of fake identities to get him to send over unpublished research. He said the student then submitted the work as his own and presented it at conferences. ""He also dressed like me, posed for photos matched to ones of me, told people he had done things that I'd done, and most scarily of all, copied my hand tattoos exactly,"" Mr Lodder posted on Twitter. Mr Lodder said it came to light after the imposter liked a photo on fellow academic Anna Friedman's Instagram account, only for her to discover he had copied her website and biography and presented them as his own. Ms Friedman said she was ""flabbergasted to find the total theft"" of her website and alerted Mr Lodder as she discovered his material had been copied too. Mr Lodder said the man was caught out two years ago, but he decided to only now share his story after the ""dust had settled"". 'Very disturbing' Mr Lodder, who lives in Colchester where the University of Essex is based, said: ""Plagiarism is normally a sin of laziness, not something people normally put a lot of effort into. ""But the sheer multi layers of this were kind of astonishing."" Ms Friedman, who lives in the Chicago area, added: ""His impersonation of me never reached the same level of creepiness as it did with him copying Matt's personal style and tattoos, but it was very disturbing nevertheless."" Mr Lodder said they reported the student to his university and he was subsequently removed from his course. He said it was not reported to the police as plagiarism was not a criminal offence and the student did not harass or threaten him. The last he, knowingly, heard from the imposter was when he received an email apologising, Mr Lodder said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Apple apologises and fixes security flaw,"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The flaw, revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. The latest version of MacOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users,â the firm said. ""When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. ""This morning, as of 8am PT, the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of MacOS High Sierra.â It is only second time Apple has forcibly updated usersâ machines and comes in response to widespread concern that millions of Mac computers were at risk. Users running older versions of MacOS will see a notification prompting an upgrade. ""Security is a top priority for every Apple product,â the company said. âAnd regrettably we stumbled with this release of MacOS.â It added: ""Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.â Disclosure Attention is now turning to the way in which the bug was made public. The story hit headlines after the flaw was tweeted by Lemi Ergin, a self-described ""software craftsman"". He was criticised for not adhering to ""responsible disclosure"" guidelines in security research, whereby companies are given a reasonable amount of time to fix a flaw before it is made public. However, after coming for criticism for tweeting the vulnerability, Mr Ergin published a post on Medium defending his decision. ""I am neither a hacker, nor a security specialist,"" he wrote. ""I solely focus on secure coding practices while programming, but I can never call myself a security specialist."" He said his colleagues at payments firm Iyzico informed Apple about the flaw on 23 November. It had previously been discussed on open Apple support forums on 13 November - though the user described the issue more like a feature than a serious bug. Apple's own statement on Wednesday said the company's security team were not made aware of the problem until 28 November - though it is not clear if another department at the company was aware.

Brexit: Corbyn aides warn against pre-election referendum,"By Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC News These senior aides are concerned he is being pushed into a position which would delay a general election for some months by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and other leading members of his shadow cabinet. Behind the scenes, there is quite simply a major disagreement. Senior Labour figures have been discussing how to respond if Boris Johnson presents a Brexit deal to Parliament this coming Saturday. Some shadow cabinet members such as Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett would want the deal voted down, a vote of no confidence to follow swiftly, and an alternative administration put in place to ask for a Brexit extension and call an election. But another powerful group - including Mr McDonnell and deputy leader Tom Watson - are pressing for a referendum ahead of a general election. One possibility would be to seek to amend a Boris Johnson deal to make it subject to a public vote. But in correspondence seen by the BBC, some of Mr Corbyn's closest advisers are warning against taking this route. First, they believe a referendum will not gain enough votes in the House of Commons so the Labour leader will be seen to have failed in pushing for one. Second, he risks being portrayed as trying to duck out of a general election - which will then be used against him by his opponents when the election does eventually come. And third, even if successful, there would be no electoral mandate for a new referendum in any case. One aide has warned Mr Corbyn is at risk of being bounced into a position that he really doesn't want to be in. But those aides are concerned the Labour leader is now ignoring the advice of long-standing colleagues. 'A slow coup' Key members of his office - including chief of staff Karie Murphy - were moved to Labour's HQ recently. This was widely seen as an attempt to sideline some of Mr Corbyn's staunch defenders who also oppose campaigning on a Remain platform in any general election. Continuing members of staff are now having informal meetings, albeit with Mr Corbyn's agreement, to discuss their roles with Lord Kerslake - a former senior civil servant who has been an unpaid adviser to the shadow chancellor. I understand Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett have questioned the wisdom of embarking on a review of the leader's office now, while one insider said ""we should be focusing on taking on the Tories rather than having consultants in to look at the staff."" One Corbyn supporter described the process as ""very serious"" and suggested it was like witnessing a ""slow coup"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Rory McIlroy fan hit by lightning at golf event 'bruised and shaken',"Terry Murphy, from Cookstown, said his son Ryan, 19, had been following Rory McIlroy at the event in Atlanta when the ""freak"" incident occurred. Mr Murphy said his son had spent the summer working in the US and the golf trip had been a year in the planning. ""He's bruised and shaken,"" he said. ""And he wants to come home."" He said they had been texting each other throughout Saturday, with Ryan providing a live running commentary of the Tour Championship. Both are members of Killymoon Golf Club in Cookstown and Ryan had gone to Georgia on his own hoping to see a McIlroy victory. ""I was asking what he was wearing to see if I could see him on the TV,"" he said. Ryan's last text was about play being suspended because of storms and then when news broke about the lightning strike, Mr Murphy said he just knew something was wrong. ""I just felt it in my gut so I tried to call him,"" he said. 'He's alive' There was no response so the family started calling around hospitals. The panic and the not-knowing lasted about 45 minutes. While his wife was speaking to a nurse, Ryan picked up his phone. ""I heard the beeping of machines and I knew it was medical,"" he said. ""The first thing he said to me was 'Don't say anything to mummy'."" Ryan told his father he had been sheltering under a tree when the lightning struck and all he could remember was waking up ""yards away"" with the emergency services all around him. ""He's had scans just to make sure there is no internal damage,"" said his father. Ryan was back in his hotel by Sunday afternoon and is hoping to fly home to Northern Ireland on Tuesday. He had only finished camp a week ago and had headed to Chicago before taking a flight to Georgia. He was due to go on to San Francisco and then New York before coming home to start at Queen's University, where he will be studying structural engineering with architecture. His father said it was ""unfortunate"" that he had to cancel his plans but ""he's alive"".

Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away',"The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said huge pumps needed for the water mist system had arrived on site the day before the blaze. But the body said it would have taken weeks to complete the installation. The iconic Mackintosh building was gutted by the blaze a week ago last Friday. Keith MacGillivray, chief executive of the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association, told BBC Scotland: ""The pumps for the fire suppression system were there at the school of art the day before the fire. ""They are very large pumps so they were delivered in component parts. ""It would have taken some weeks to reassemble the pumps and connect up the pipe work and obviously the water tanks would have had to be connected and put in place as well. ""Everything would also would have had to be tested thoroughly before being made operational."" Building control officers have warned people to stay away from the site of the art school fire. They revealed concerns about the end walls of the building, which could fall into the street ""without warning"". Local residents have expressed anger and frustration at being unable to return to their homes since a safety cordon was put in place in the vicinity of the building. 'Beyond frustrating' Some claimed there had been a lack of communication from the council and other bodies over when they might be able to go back. Michael Argent, who lives close to the art school, said: ""The most difficult thing is not knowing how long it is going to be."" Another local resident, Christopher Bowen, said: ""It is beyond frustrating because the communication has been awful. We have more or less been left to our own devices."" A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: ""This has been an incredibly difficult situation for businesses and residents and the fact that there is no real change in the information we're able to give them is incredibly frustrating for people. ""We've so far been able to find accommodation for everyone who has told us they need it. ""However, people's circumstances change regularly and if they find themselves becoming effectively homeless then they can meet with our staff who are based in the dental hospital or call our helpline on 0141 287 0416.

Pakistanis respond after 'spy pigeon' detained in India,"BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why It all started when a 14-year-old boy in an Indian village close to the border with Pakistan found a white pigeon with a message written partly in Urdu, the language widely used in Pakistan, and some numbers in on its feathers. The bird was taken to police who ordered the bird to be X-rayed. Nothing suspicious turned up, but the pigeon was registered in police logs as a ""suspected spy"" according to reports. The area where the bird was found is close to Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan and the scene of cross-border military confrontation. ""This is a rare instance of a bird from Pakistan being spotted here. We have caught a few spies here. The area is sensitive, given its proximity to Jammu, where infiltration is quite common,"" local police superintendent Rakesh Kaushal told the Times of India. India and Pakistan frequently accuse each other of spying. This week, the Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed concern over the actions of foreign intelligence agencies in Pakistan - which many saw as an allusion to India. But the official detention of a bird led to amusement and sarcasm on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, pictures were created to mock the Indian authorities and portray the humble pigeon as a suave modern-day spy. The hashtags #PigeonVsIndia and #IfIWereAPigeon have been mentioned tens of thousands of times. Both hashtags appear to be promoted by two social media teams who actively seek to create Twitter trends, and identify themselves as supporters of Pakistan's Tehrik-i-Insaf political party. Here's a selection of the pigeon memes causing a flap on Pakistani social media: This is not the first bird detained on suspicion of, ahem, foul play. In 2010, a pigeon suspected of being a Pakistani spy was handed over to wildlife authorities after an investigation, according to The Indian Express newspaper.

A US judge asked lawyers to explain the lyrics to Thriller,"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter US Tax Court Judge Mark Holmes had always been puzzled by the rap at the end of Michael Jackson's Thriller, so when the star's former lawyer John Branca appeared in front of him on Monday, he took the opportunity to settle the matter. ""You're familiar with Thriller,"" Holmes said. ""What exactly does 'the funk of 40,000 years' mean?"" ""Karma,"" answered Branca. The exchange came during the first day of a trial looking into Michael Jackson's debts to the taxman. The IRS claims that Jackson's estate owes it more than $700 million (Â£566 million) in taxes and penalties, a massive chunk of the star's estimated $1bn fortune. It puts Jackson's team in the strange position of arguing the star was worth much less, after his image was tarnished by accusations of child molestation, skin bleaching and drug use. The argument centres around the commercial value of Jackson's name and image at the time of his death. The IRS says he was worth $434 million (Â£350 million). Jackson's estate says the figure is $2,105 (Â£1,701). And no, that's not a misprint. We double-checked. Prominent music industry lawyer John Branca, who represented the King of Pop off and on for nearly three decades, was first to take the stand. He said the star was $400 million in debt when he died, and his family had to scramble to stop his houses being repossessed. Branca said the star had become commercially toxic after the first allegations of child abuse were made against him in the 1990s. By contrast, he talked about the sponsorship deal he had negotiated with Pepsi for the Jackson's Victory tour - which took place months after Thriller was released in 1984. ""Michael made me write into the contract that he would never be seen holding a Pepsi can and he would never be onscreen for more than three seconds,"" said Branca, illustrating Jackson's ability to dictate the terms of the deal. A decade later, however, Jackson could not find a single company willing to sponsor the HIStory world tour. ""Were there any offers for the use of Michael's name and likeness during that period?"" asked Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for Jackson's estate. ""Nothing credible that I recall,"" Branca said. The lawyer began to get emotional as he talked about working with Jackson, according The Hollywood Reporter. ""I'm going to tear up,"" he said. ""Michael was a genius. He was a great guy. When I tell these stories, I actually tell them with affection."" The IRS declined to cross-examine Branca, saying they would call him back when they present their case. The trial is expected to last three weeks. Or more, if the judge asks the meaning of ""mamase, mamasa, mamakusa"". Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Belfast homeless: At least five dead since January, says charity","By Andy WestBBC News NI There are no specific statistics on those who die during or after a period of homelessness. However, the Welcome Organisation said rough sleepers are dying due to mental and physical illness caused or made worse by the harsh conditions. The life expectancy of a homeless person is around 47 years. There are no official statistics on fatalities on the streets and it is unclear in these latest cases what the causes of death might have been. Historically, a range of issues are involved including exposure to the elements, drink and drug abuse and acute and at times untreated medical problems. The number of people sleeping rough in Belfast is rising, according to latest statistics. Latest figures show a slight increase in homelessness over the last five years. However, front-line volunteers believe there are many more ""hidden homeless"" using their services without making themselves known to the authorities. 'Bureaucratic process' All homeless people must register with the Housing Executive before they are able to apply for a bed in a hostel, though there is a limited number of beds in night shelters. The registration process can take weeks. This causes many homeless people, who often have mental health issues, poor literacy or fears over their safety, to remain on the streets with no government support, access to housing or healthcare. Sandra Moore, director of homelessness services at the Welcome Organisation, said: ""Homeless people find it much more difficult to fill out forms to access services and that can be a problem. ""The agencies in Belfast work very hard to ensure continual services and are always working towards change to ensure people not only get a roof over their heads but can also sustain that, which is a challenge. ""We're pushing for change, so people can get a roof over their heads while they go through the registration process. Common causes ""It would save money in the long run because the quicker you get someone off the streets, the less care they need further down the road."" According to a report by homeless charity Crisis, one in 18 (5.7%) of all adults in Northern Ireland had said they had experienced homelessness of some kind, either having slept on the streets, in a hostel or someone else's home. The report also indicated that the most common cause for homelessness was sharing breakdown or family dispute (22%), where a person has to leave accommodation after falling out with fellow tenants or family. The second most common cause was loss of rented accommodation (15%). Mortgage default accounted for relatively few cases (5%) while domestic violence was the cause of 3% of homelessness.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Tube passengers forced to walk off train in Underground,"Commuters endured another day of misery when services were delayed, disrupted or cancelled on parts of the network. London Underground apologised for disruptions and admitted customers ""deserved better"", while unions claimed the Tube was in ""crisis"". The delays followed Monday's Jubilee Line power failure, which led to passengers being stranded. Four hundred passengers on the Victoria Line were walked off their train at about 1100 BST after it broke down for two hours in a tunnel between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park. Three trains stuck behind had to be reversed. Passenger Tatjana Nekazakova said: ""We were stuck down there for two hours and a pregnant woman was getting upset. Luckily someone had water that was passed around."" Overtime ban London Underground's managing director Mike Brown said passengers ""deserve much better than the service they have had in recent days and all our energies are focused on delivering a fast, reliable and safe service"". He went on: ""I know that having to walk along the track through a tunnel is distressing. ""It is not something our customers should have to expect, and is something we always seek to avoid. ""Nevertheless, on the rare occasions when a train is stuck in a tunnel, as soon as it becomes clear that we will not be able to arrange for it to be moved within a reasonable timescale, the safest and best option is to take customers off of the train."" There were delays on other parts of the Tube system on Tuesday, including the Northern and Circle lines, because of signal failures and track problems. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said a continuing ban on overtime by thousands of workers in a long-running row over job cuts was having an effect on services. The union, and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), has already held two strikes and is threatening fresh walkouts on 2 and 28 November claiming Transport for London was now planning to cut almost 2,000 jobs. Talks between the two sides were held on Tuesday at the conciliation service Acas. Service 'black hole' RMT leader Bob Crow said: ""Once again this morning the transport system in London has been reduced to chaos through a combination of mismanagement, financial cuts and a withdrawal of goodwill by Tube staff who are furious at the ongoing threat to another 2,000 jobs. ""Those job losses would plunge travellers even deeper into the black hole of unsafe and unreliable services."" In a separate development, the RMT announced that Tube maintenance staff would begin industrial action short of a strike from Tuesday 26 October, after they voted in favour of the move in a row over spending cuts. A spokesman said: ""This means staff will not 'act up' and only work to booked instructions. They will only do what they're told, they won't use their initiative.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors',"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website The Stanford University team said the findings were ""incredibly exciting"" and would now be tested in clinics. Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner. Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors. The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs. It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one. It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma. Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths. The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors. One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: ""We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists."" However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy. Dr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic. ""The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good,"" he said. ""One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device."" Incredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players. And a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail. Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists. ""It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future."" Brett Kuprel, another researcher on the project, added: ""The end-to-end training and transfer learning approaches we used can be applied to many problems in healthcare, provided there is a large enough dataset. ""It could transform treatment in ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology."" Follow James on Twitter.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Stockholm truck attack: Who is Rakhmat Akilov?,"Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek asylum seeker, ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass on 7 April 2017, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm. He was jailed for life for terrorist crimes in June 2018. After his arrest, a picture of Akilov started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him. Bumping into a former colleague, he revealed he was spending his days ""sleeping and smoking"". He had left his wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan, and earned money to send home to them. Akilov had applied for residency in 2014 but had been informed in December 2016 that ""he had four weeks to leave the country"", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list. A few months earlier he had reportedly lost his job after falling asleep at work. Read more: He had been working in construction and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks in 2016, helping on an asbestos removal project. Akilov was, he said, ""a reserved person"". ""He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,"" he told news agency AFP. Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he ""partied and drank"", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine. ""He never talked about politics or religion,"" one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. ""He didn't pray five times a day from what I know."" A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: ""He was like any normal guy."" Online, it seems, it was a different story. His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - was linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing. He also liked a page called ""Friends of Libya and Syria"", which says it aims to expose ""terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals"" of the US, British and Arab ""dictatorships"". However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. Despite all this, Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a ""marginal character"", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Egypt court quashes Red Sea islands' transfer to Saudis,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and ""selling"" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. Cheers in court: By Sally Nabil, BBC News The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali. When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting ""the islands are Egyptian"". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed. The verdict stated that the two islands would ""remain under Egyptian sovereignty"". If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding. However, the State Lawsuits Authority, which represents the Egyptian state in lawsuits, said on Tuesday evening that it would challenge the ruling, state television reported. Mr Sisi has cracked down on all dissent since leading the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed, most of them supporters of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood.

Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Education (DE) revealed the figure to the Stormont Education Committee on Tuesday. Up until Tuesday 8 September, DE had been notified of 88 positive cases in 64 schools. More than 300,000 children returned to classrooms in the first week of September. The data on how many pupils and staff have been advised to self-isolate as a result is held by the Public Health Agency (PHA). Adrian Murphy, from DE, told the committee that a number of schools had been in touch with the department about positive cases. ""We know how many schools have been in contact with us and in contact with the Education Authority where they have had positive cases reported,"" Mr Murphy said. ""The department itself does not hold data on the actual number of positive cases, that data is held by the PHA,"" he said. ""They hold all the testing data and the information in terms of whatever pupils or contacts of pupils would then be confirmed as a positive case,"" he added. ""All we know at the point when we are managing this system is that we have been contacted by a number of parents and a number of schools where we have closures. ""Yesterday that was 88 reports into schools of a positive case in 64 education settings. ""You need to be mindful that that is out of 1,300 educational establishments so 64 is actually a very, very small proportion,"" he said. 'Only test if they have symptoms' Mr Murphy did not specify how many cases were in primary, post-primary or special schools. A number of schools in Northern Ireland have sent groups of pupils home to self-isolate for 14 days following advice from the PHA. Mr Murphy also re-iterated that children should only be tested if they have symptoms of Covid-19. The SDLP's education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the numbers would ""cause concern"". ""We need to be assured that we have a robust testing and tracing operation capable of meeting the increased demand that we're going to experience in the coming weeks and particularly as the cold and flu season begins,"" he said. ""We need to make sure that there's a mechanism for ensuring rapid testing of these cases in our schools to minimise disruption and keep the entire school community safe."" However, the department also said that pupil and staff attendance rates at schools in the first full week of term were above 90%. According to John Smith from DE, overall pupil attendance rates in primary schools were 92.8% while in post-primary schools they were at 94.6%. In special schools, pupil attendance rates were 87.2%. Some 96.3% of teaching staff had been in school from 1 September while 97.3% of non-teaching staff had attended, according to the department.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Drones hamper US firefighting efforts,"Lives were put at unnecessary risk because helicopters could not fly, said fire department officials. The helicopters were helping to contain a large wildfire in San Bernadino county over the weekend. Five drones spotted hovering over the fire were thought to be shooting video for their owners. News footage of the fire shows people abandoning their cars to escape the flames as the fire engulfed Interstate 15 - a major road that links Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The fire destroyed 20 vehicles on the road and damaged 10 more. More than 4,250 acres have been consumed by the fire which has been exacerbated by California's four-year drought. The activity of the drones meant helicopters were grounded for about 20 minutes, Eric Sherwin of the San Bernadino fire department told CNN. ""Fifteen to 20 minutes were lost that could have led to another water drop cycle, and that would have created a much safer environment and we would not have seen as many citizens running for their lives,"" he said. Flight restriction Hobby drones posed a ""pose a major safety threat to firefighting pilots and firefighters"", said an official incident report into the Interstate 15 fire. ""When a hobby drone is flown into a fire area, incident commanders have no choice but to suspend air operations and ground aircraft until the drone is removed from the area,"" it said. A collision could damage aircraft, injure the pilot, crew or firefighters below, it warned. At worst, it said, drones could cause helicopters to collide in mid-air. The fire department issued images that were shared on social media, warning drone owners to stay away from fires. ""If you fly, we can't,"" they said. US rules governing drone use mean any pilot caught flying their craft over a disaster area that has temporary flight restrictions in place could be fined up to $25,000 (Â£16,000). It is not clear whether the FAA is going to investigate who was piloting the drones over the Interstate 15 fire. Drones have hindered firefighters in California at least four times before now, sometimes stopping flights for up to 90 minutes.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Baby ashes scandal 'will not happen again',"Maureen Watt made the pledge as MSPs unanimously backed the general principles of the Burial and Cremation (Scotland) Bill on Thursday. The bill was brought forward in response to the scandal at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh. Staff at the crematorium had secretly buried the ashes of babies for decades. The parents of the infants had been told there were no ashes left when young babies were cremated. Concerns were later raised about other crematoriums across Scotland. The new legislation follows on from the recommendations of Lord Bonomy's Infant Cremation Commission. Ms Watt set out plans to bring forward a series of amendments in response to calls from Holyrood's Health and Sport Committee to strengthen its provisions. Committee convener Duncan McNeil said MSPs had heard moving evidence of the ""long-lasting and devastating"" impact of the ashes scandal. He said: ""The bereaved parents who shared their views with the committee sent a very clear message - this bill must ensure that the poor practice of the past should never happen again."" Ms Watt said the bill would make ""valuable and much needed"" improvements to burial and cremation laws which were more than 100-years-old. She said there were a number of problems with the current system, including an overly-complicated process that can be ""difficult to understand at the best of times, let alone when dealing with the loss of a loved one."" Ms Watt added: ""There can also be a lack of clear information given to the person who is making the funeral arrangements. ""Lord Bonomy's Infant Cremation Commission identified all too clearly the potential impact of these problems. ""The steps taken in this bill will help ensure that such failings can never occur again."" The minister confirmed amendments to ensure that women experiencing a pregnancy loss were put at the centre of decision-making over any remains, to improve the process following a post 24-week termination and to strengthen what crematoriums and funeral director could do with ashes. 'Licensing scheme' Labour MSP Jenny Marra said: ""What happened with infant ashes in Scotland should never be allowed to happen again and we must ensure that women are at the centre of decisions at a very, very difficult time."" Conservative MSP Nanette Milne added: ""The bill goes some way towards ensuring that past bad practice will not recur although I think it will need to be refined as it goes through the next stages of the parliamentary process."" Holyrood's Local Government and Regeneration Committee, which looked at aspects of the bill relating to burials, complained that it ""lacks ambition"" and called for the introduction of licensing for funeral directors. Ms Watt said: ""At the moment there is not enough evidence about the industry as a whole to say with certainty that licensing is required or what form a licensing scheme would take."" She said the inspectors appointed under the bill would review the industry and make recommendations about the need for licensing.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Putin critic Bill Browder freed after brief arrest in Spain,"After an hour in custody he was released because the warrant was no longer valid, Spanish police said. Mr Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. Interpol rejected the claim, saying: ""There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr Bill Browder."" The agency said in a statement: ""Mr Browder is not wanted via Interpol channels."" But there were multiple accounts about how the confusion arose, and why Mr Browder was detained. A police spokesman told AFP: ""An arrest warrant has a date limit and when that expires, it must be deleted from the computer programme and in this case Interpol hadn't deleted it."" But the US-born financier, who is a British citizen, tweeted that a new notice had been issued. ""Spanish National Police just released me after Interpol General Secretary in Lyon advised them not to honor the new Russian Interpol Red Notice,"" he said. ""This is the sixth time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case."" Interpol had previously refused to enforce a 2013 warrant for the investor, deeming it ""predominantly political in nature"". Mr Browder is widely credited with the creation of the Magnitsky Act - a 2012 range of sanctions from the United States on top Russian officials accused of corruption. The act was named after his former lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered an alleged tax fraud in Moscow - and died in a Russian prison in 2009. Since then, Mr Browder has campaigned for investigations into the alleged fraud. He was put on trial in absentia in 2013 for tax evasion - in the same trial where the deceased Magnitsky faced charges, which was labelled ""absurd"" by observers. Mr Browder was once one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, controlling Hermitage Capital Management. Russian prosecutors accused him of creating a firm for tax fraud purposes. Mr Browder has always said that the charges against him are politically motivated. British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said he spoke to Mr Browder and was ""very glad that he has now been released"". ""Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of #Magnitsky to justice,"" he tweeted. Mr Browder was in Madrid to give evidence to a Spanish prosecutor about money from the Magnitsky case that was moved to Spain. He said the arrest while on such a trip was ironic, but added: ""Now that I'm released my mission carries on.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Ben Affleck slavery row leads to TV show suspension,"Finding Your Roots, similar to the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, researches celebrity family histories. A review into an episode, which aired in October, concluded Affleck lobbied producers about ditching details about his slave-owning ancestors. PBS said it plans to hire a fact-checker and an independent genealogist. Following its investigation, PBS concluded producers violated network standards by allowing Batman star Affleck to have ""improper influence"" and ""by failing to inform PBS or [New York TV station] WNET of Mr. Affleck's efforts to affect programme content"". The public service broadcaster said it would not commit to a fourth season of the series ""until we are satisfied that the editorial standards of the series have been successfully raised to a level in which we can have confidence"". Affleck's request to omit details about a slave-owning relative from the show came to light with the publication of hacked Sony emails between the series host, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, and Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. The details were eventually left out of the show. ""I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use,"" Affleck wrote on Facebook, when the email exchange came to light earlier this year. ""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed,"" the actor said. At the time, Gates defended his editorial choices: ""Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck - we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry,"" he said in a statement, released in April this year. In a statement released on Wednesday, Gates thanked PBS for its ""thoughtful internal review"". ""I sincerely regret not discussing my editing rationale with our partners at PBS and WNET, and I apologise for putting PBS and its member stations in the position of having to defend the integrity of their programming."" The third series of the show will be delayed to ensure ""improved editorial and production processes"", PBS said in their statement. It added that the episode in which Affleck's ancestry is examined will be withdrawn from all forms of distribution, including digital streaming and DVD.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Bird family tree shaken by discovery of feathered fossil,"By Helen BriggsBBC News The turacos, or banana-eaters, are today found only in Africa, living in forests and savannah. A beautifully preserved fossil bird from 52 million years ago is shaking up the family tree of the exotic birds. The fossil's weird features suggests it is the earliest known living relative not just of the turacos, but of cuckoos and bustards (large long-legged birds). And the fact the remains were unearthed in North America shows the distribution of different birds around the globe would have been very different in the past. The banana-eaters ""Our analyses show with some strong support that the fossil is the earliest known representative of this group, the turacos, or the banana-eaters, that today are only found in sub-Saharan Africa,"" said Dr Daniel Field, a vertebrate palaeontologist in the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath. ""Although, our fossil comes from western North America and it's about 52 million years old."" The attractive and colourful turacos of Africa are noisy, gregarious birds. They feed mostly on fruits and enjoy bananas, as their name suggests. Dr Field said these fascinating birds, which he has photographed all over Africa, are a group well known to bird watchers. ""They're extremely gaudy, very colourful, and their feathers contain unique pigments that produce brilliant greens and red tones that are present in no other groups of living birds,"" he told BBC News. Feathered fossil Dr Field and Allison Hsiang of the Swedish Museum of Natural History decided to take a closer look at the fossil bird (Foro Panarium), in the light of new knowledge about bird evolution. The fossil, originally dug up in 1982 in Wyoming, has a mixture of features that are shared by different groups of living birds. They were surprised to find the fossil bird was an ancient relative of the turaco, but found miles away from its living descendants. This raises questions about how, when, and why the birds became restricted to tropical latitudes. Dr Field said there are over 11,000 living species of bird today, and trying to understand how this incredible diversity is only possible ""by appealing to what the fossil record tells us about how those evolutionary transitions have taken place"". More stories like this, you might like to read: How birds got their beaks Baby bird fossil is 'rarest of the rare' Dino-bird fossil had sparkly feathers The fossil shines a light on the very early history of birds at a time when they were rapidly evolving after the asteroid strike 66 million years ago, which wiped out the giant dinosaurs.

Live: For more on this and other stories from across Suffolk The RAF serviceman from Dunfermline, Fife, has not been seen since a night out in the Suffolk town when CCTV showed him entering a bin loading bay. ""Let us help financially, let us help physically searching, or ask the military to assist them,"" she said. ""But do something, don't just walk away if that's where they think he is.""

Mrs Urquhart said her appeal for the search to continue ""doesn't diminish"" her gratitude for what police have done so far, but claimed ""there are other things that could be done"". ""The picture in my head is that Corrie is literally one more lorry load away from being found in that landfill, or he is one more lorry load away from the police being able to turn round and say 'we know Corrie is not in this landfill now' and that's the sort of answer we should be getting.""

Liposuction rise linked to gym wear trend,"Rajiv Grover, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says latest UK data shows procedures have gone up 12% in a year, from 2,039 in 2017 to 2,286 in 2018. He warned that there was no quick fix to fighting flab. Surgery has risks as well as benefits and should be a ""last resort"", he said. Liposuction Source: British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons According to the new figures, more than 28,000 plastic surgery procedures took place in 2018, a small increase of 0.1% on 2017. Women underwent 92% of all cosmetic procedures recorded. As in 2017, the three most popular procedures for women were breast augmentation, breast reduction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). The biggest increases for women were for liposuction, which rose 12%, and facelifts, which rose 9%. Mr Grover, who runs the audit, said: ""The rise comes at a time where a fashion trend for women is athleisure clothing, showing what kind of physique you have rather than covering up."" Athleisure includes figure-hugging clothing, such as leggings and bra tops, suitable for exercise and everyday wear. He said that the rise in liposuction could also be more women seeking fat loss surgery over less invasive fat freezing methods (although the audit data does not include non-surgical procedures). ""People should know that liposuction is not risk-free,"" he said. ""An operation is not something that can simply be returned to the shop if you have second thoughts."" He gave the example of footballer's wife Denise Hendry, who died in 2009 during one of several operations carried out to correct complications caused by botched liposuction. ""People need to be aware that liposuction is an invasive procedure that carries risks. And it is not a cure for being overweight. There is no shortcut, although it can help with stubborn areas of fat. ""My advice? Eat a healthy diet and exercise if you want to get that gym body."" Kate Dale, from Sport England's This Girl Can campaign said: ""We understand the pressures women feel under - our research shows that a fear of being judged is the number one reason stopping many women from getting active.

City sanguine on snap election call,"Simon JackBusiness editor The pound has gained 1% and although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May called a snap election for 8 June. Still, market watchers are reading the tea leaves and have made a few observations. Since the big fall in sterling after the referendum result, the pound has tended to rise at times when a softer Brexit has looked more likely and vice versa. Today's rise in the pound suggests markets are betting that Theresa May will (a) win and (b) win a bigger majority than she currently has, which (c) will make her less dependent on hardline Eurosceptics in her own party. The theory goes that all this will allow her room to deliver a softer Brexit, which will be less of a shock to the economic system - hence the pound strengthens. The stock market is falling because most of the UK's largest companies make their money in foreign currencies. As the pound rises, those foreign earnings are worth less in sterling terms. That is the way markets are reading it today, but as we know, markets can be pretty terrible at reading politics and it is certainly not a done deal that Theresa May will use any consolidation of her position as an opportunity to peddle a softer line on Brexit. Complex situation One thing an election in June does give her - if she wins - is more breathing room. She will be under less pressure to deliver a ""clean"" Brexit in 2019 without the deadline of another election in 2020 bearing down on her. Facing the country again while possibly still enmeshed in tortuous negotiation (with potentially little control over immigration by then) was an unappealing political prospect. Business groups have been broadly supportive of the move. All other things being equal, businesses prefer the additional certainty that a government with a larger majority can provide. The EEF said ""a fresh and stable mandate from the country can only provide greater certainty about the future direction of travel for policy"", while the CBI had a cooler response, saying: ""Distraction from the urgent priorities of seeking the best EU deal and improving UK productivity must be kept to a minimum."" While it's true that this election is a further complication to an already mind-bogglingly complex situation, very little can meaningfully be achieved in negotiations until after elections in France, Germany and possibly Italy. Everyone else seems to be having an election, so we might as well have one here while the political and economic going is good. The economy has defied the gloomy prognosis that many, including the Treasury and the Bank of England, gave before the referendum.

Foals: Oxford band go from squat parties to Albert Hall,"By Greg CochraneNewsbeat music reporter ""There were two things we didn't want to do,"" recalls frontman Yannis Philappakis. ""One was not do a record which was exactly like [2008's] Antidotes. The other was not to do one which was exactly like [2010's] Total Life Forever. ""We have an internal motor which means we don't want to do the things which are prior,"" he smiles. Holy Fire True to their word, that's what they've done on Holy Fire - which is currently top of the midweek album chart (12 February). It sees the Oxford group exploring new musical territory, but also threatens to catapult them to the attention of a much wider audience. The first hint of change arrived late 2012 with the release of Inhaler - a melodic track built around a hulking, huge guitar riff. ""It just feels good to do from the neck down,"" explains Philappakis, about their heavier slant. ""Me and Jack Bevan [drums] were in a band when we were younger. It was heavy riffs all the way through - we hadn't explored it for such a long time that it became interesting again. ""The heavier bands which I grew up listening to were like Slayer, Deftones, Tool, Black Sabbath. Obviously Rage [Against The Machine], everyone loves Rage."" It's not a complete make-over for the band but it is an evolution. Reviews of Holy Fire have focussed on Foals' continuous rise. BBC Music's review said ""arena tours should await them"", while NME called it ""sharp, emotive, massive"". Ambition Yannis admits back when the band were touring in a recycled Royal Mail van ""playing to no-one"" they didn't think six years down the line they'd be playing the main stage at Reading festival. ""The more people we get to play to, the more of a connection,"" he says. ""It's all the sweeter because it didn't happen instantly."" Indeed, since forming the Oxford band have gone from playing sweaty squat parties to headlining London's Royal Albert Hall via a Mercury Prize nomination and numerous world tours. ""There's something to be said for taking your time and earning those sorts of things rather them them just falling in your lap on day one,"" smiles Yannis. ""We really are locked into the day-to-day, there's probably a really frightening lack of forethought,"" he says, playing down their ambition. Side projects What's clear though, whether they planned it or not Foals are about to get a whole lot bigger. And the band's ambitions are getting broader. ""I'd love to [do] a film soundtrack - I'm sure Jimmy [Smith, guitar] would as well,"" explains the singer. ""At some point, probably in the not too distance future, we are going to start doing things on the side largely to satisfy creative impulses which we can't satisfy with Foals. ""There are definitely certain things I would like to do which would shock, terrify and scar a lot of Foals fans."" Holy Fire is out now Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor HMD Odyssey joins previously announced VR headsets and hand controllers from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer and Asus to form the launch hardware line-up for Microsoft's new Mixed Reality platform. Unlike earlier PC-based VR kit, the new products are able to track their wearers' movements in a room without requiring additional external sensors. But experts have questioned whether the market will support so many brands. Until now, HTC's Vive and Facebook's Oculus Rift have had most of the market in high-end PC-based VR headsets to themselves. But the two firms had only sold a combined total of just over one million headsets by the end of June, according to SuperData Research. Both have cut their prices in recent months in an attempt to stimulate demand. By contrast, Samsung's more basic Gear VR - which works with some of its smartphones - had sold more than eight million units, according to the same market research. ""VR is still a very youthful medium,"" commented Kevin Joyce, editor-in-chief of the news site VR Focus. ""There's a number of significant barriers to entry - price, lack of variety in software collections etc - all of which are slowly being addressed. ""But in the short term, I do think we'll see some of the hardware manufacturers in the current race fall before the final hurdle [since some] will want a return on their investment sooner rather than later."" Halo VR Microsoft hosted an event in San Francisco to mark the release of a new version of Windows 10 on 17 October that supports new virtual and augmented reality capabilities. The firm uses the term ""mixed reality"" to refer to both VR experiences, which are based solely in computer-generated worlds, as well as AR, which mixes graphics and real-world views together. Samsung's headset was pitched as a premium way to experience VR, thanks to it featuring higher-resolution OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays than the other new kit. It also has a slightly wider field-of-view and integrated headphones. However, its $499 (Â£425) price makes it more expensive and it will go on sale a month later in November. Other announcements included: Microsoft is also developing an AR-based headset that does not require a separate PC called the HoloLens. But a prototype sold to developers costs Â£2,719 and there was no update as to when it will get a mass-market release. One industry-watcher suggested that consumers tempted to invest in Microsoft and its partners' VR tech should wait a while before making a purchase. ""The launch of all of those head mounted displays will create a lot of competition and possibly price aggressiveness in this space in the coming holiday season,"" Annette Zimmermann from the consultancy Gartner told the BBC. ""Until now all PC vendors were linking their high-end devices with Oculus or HTC headsets. ""With their own headsets available, it is likely that they will focus on promoting bundles with their own devices.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Poet Philip Gross wins Wales Book of the Year,"Philip Gross's I Spy Pinhole Eye was one of the three shortlisted works for the Â£10,000 prize. It is the Penarth poet's second major award in a year - a different collection of his won the TS Eliot prize, also worth Â£10,000, in January. John Davies won the Welsh-language award for his book Cymru: Y 100 lle i'w gweld cyn marw. The title translates as Wales: 100 places to see before dying. The announcements were made at a gala dinner in St David's Hotel in Cardiff Bay, introduced by BBC Wales' political editor Betsan Powys. Heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones presented Gross with the cheque for Â£10,000. I Spy Pinhole Eye is described as a collaborative work between the poet and photographer Simon Denison, who used a pinhole camera to transform the footings of electricity pylons. The poetry explores the act of seeing and interpretation. Gross is a professor of creative writing at the University of Glamorgan. Also shortlisted were novelist Terri Wiltshire, from Newport, for her debut novel Carry Me Home and Nikolai Tolstoy, from Berkshire, for a non-fiction work The Compilation of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, an analysis of the origins of the Welsh folk tales. The awards were decided by poet and University of Wales lecturer Ian Gregson, novelist James Hawes and broadcaster Sara Edwards. 'Close-fought battle' James Hawes said: ""Anyone who thinks literary prizes are stitch-ups should have been in the room with us this afternoon. ""It was a close-fought battle with no unanimous agreement in the end so the winner is on a 2-1 majority verdict. ""We hope that Philip will relish the fact that this was a real five-set tussle not a straight sets walkover. I am personally delighted that we are making this award to a writer who, his other recent collection confirms, is at the very top of his game."" Peter Finch, chief executive of Academi, which administers the prizes, said: ""After long debate the judges have chosen what is clearly one of the best books of poetry to come out of Wales this year."" The Media Wales People's Choice Prize, which was chosen by the public via an online poll, was won by poet Richard Marggraf Turley for Wan Hu's Flying Chair.

National Farmers' Union condemns flooding plans,"Engineers have proposed creating ponds and bogs on high ground to prevent rainfall rushing down hills and causing flooding. However, NFU president Peter Kendall said farmland was ""far too valuable"". He said: ""We have to put lives and human safety first but we have to put a higher priority on agricultural land."" A Â£10m farming recovery fund, announced earlier this month by the prime minister, will open on Friday. Farming Minister George Eustice told the NFU Conference in Birmingham the money would help flood-hit farmers in key areas, such as restoring grassland, restoring access to fields and improving field drainage. All farmers affected by the floods would be able to apply for emergency funding of up to Â£5,000 under the scheme, covering up to 100% of their business costs, he said. Experts say farmers in higher areas have contributed to recent flooding by straightening streams and draining bogs that used to capture rainfall. The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) says rainfall should in future be captured in upland areas by felling trees into streams to make them overflow. It claims the resulting wetlands would also benefit wildlife. The recommendation comes after the Environment Agency admitted it ""cannot protect all people and all properties"". Back to nature However, Mr Kendall told BBC News: ""For people to say that a fallen tree is a way of managing water flows is ludicrous."" He said some farms in Somerset had been flooded ""year on year"", adding that water should not simply be ""dumped on farmers' land"". Farmers affected by the recent flooding will find out how the government will spend Â£10m set aside to help them at the National Farmers Union conference in Birmingham later. Mr Kendall said the UK should follow the example of Holland and ensure that waterways were fully dredged to carry away water swiftly to the sea. Experts point out that Holland has also recently begun to adopt a ""back-to-nature"" approach alongside dredging after deciding that it is financially and practically impossible to protect all farmland. David Rooke, executive director of flood and coastal risk management, said the Environment Agency's promise that dredging would take place on the Somerset Levels was only ""part of the solution"". He said ""adapting to a changing climate is still a work in progress"". ""What we need to do is learn from across the world and indeed the world learns from our experiences, particularly in terms of all the flood mapping we do and the flood forecasting and warning systems that we have in place,"" he said. Around 6,500 properties have been flooded this winter, which has been the wettest since 1910.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Welsh Conservative leader contender Paul Davies 'not grey',"By Aled ap DafyddBBC Wales political correspondent The interim leader of the Tory assembly group has been described by a party insider as a ""man in a beige suit"". The Preseli Pembrokeshire AM said neither he nor his colleagues thought he was ""grey"", but the right person to be first minister. He and Suzy Davies are in the running to succeed Andrew RT Davies, who stood down as group leader in June. ""I wouldn't think I'm grey. My colleagues don't think I'm grey,"" candidate Mr Davies told BBC Wales' Newyddion9 programme. ""My colleagues think I'm the right person for the job, not just to be leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the National Assembly but first minister of Wales."" Both he and rival candidate Ms Davies - AM for South West Wales - want the next assembly group leader to be known also as the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, a distinction which has appeared to cause conflict within the party in recent years. ""Devolution is devolution,"" he said. ""We obviously develop our own policies here at an assembly level and we develop policies that actually suit the needs of the people of Wales."" Mr Davies denied playing the role of a ""silent assassin"" in removing Andrew RT Davies, who stood down from the leadership feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues. ""I'm no assassin at all,"" he said. ""There was a discussion within the group, the group obviously expressed views and Andrew reflected on those views and decided to let someone else lead the group."" Mr Davies has promised Tory members a vote on any future coalition deal, and said he would be willing to talk to Plaid Cymru. ""I'd like to think I'm open,"" he added. ""I've been the business manager [for the Conservative group] over the last few years. I've built up relationships with other parties on that basis and I'd like to think people would be able to approach me."" The 12-strong Conservative group is the second biggest in the assembly and has been in opposition to Labour-led administrations since devolution in 1999. The leader will be elected by a postal ballot of party members in Wales, with the winner to be announced on 6 September.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Iceland mayors object to Google snow,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring JÃ³n PÃ¡ll Hreinsson says this could put overseas tourists off visiting BolungarvÃ­k in the picturesque Western Fjords region, whose islands and fishing villages are already a popular summer destination for Icelanders, the RÃV public broadcaster reports. ""This snowbound image gets on my nerves,"" he told the VÃ­sir news site, explaining why he sends the Google Maps site daily feedback about it - ""I'll post a comment a day, until I get through to them"". 'David and Goliath' ""I'm thinking of the millions who might be considering visiting the Western Fjords and then look at the map and see, well, nothing but snow,"" the mayor complained on his Facebook account, where he urged other people in the area to write to Google Maps too. He acknowledges that he may be in a ""David and Goliath"" situation, and appeals to ""any Icelanders working at Google to get in touch"" if they want to help.

Hinkley Point C nuclear emissions 'underestimated',"The Stop Hinkley group said reactors will discharge more radioactive waste into the Severn Estuary. The group's complaint relates to three permits issued by the Environment Agency for the running of the plant. But the agency said it had addressed concerns before issuing the permits. A decision on whether the plant will be built is expected on Tuesday. The permits cover the discharge and disposal of radioactive waste and cooling water. 'Dirty and dangerous' Stop Hinkley said its concerns were raised during the consultation process in December 2011 but were not answered in full by the agency. The campaign group said it commissioned independent consultants to review the methods used to assess the environmental impacts of radioactive emissions, and found they would not be sufficient or wide-ranging enough to discover the effects on the marine environment. Campaigner, Nikki Clarke said: ""It's about the routine emissions of radioactive liquid and gas from the station, day-in, day-out. ""The reactors that they want to build, the fuel that goes into them is hotter and more dirty and more dangerous than the fuel currently loaded into the Hinkley B station. ""The concerns that we have raised should have been addressed in a satisfactory way, before the granting of the permits, but all they (the agency) are doing is rubber-stamping and facilitating the government policy, and ignoring every other voice."" Stop Hinkley jointly handed in its submissions to the EA with the Nuclear Free Authorities (NFLA) and other organisations. 'Careful consideration' In a statement the Environment Agency denied the campaign group's claims. ""We came to our decisions to issue the Hinkley Point C permits only after careful consideration of all the responses we received following the two periods of public consultation,"" a spokesperson for the agency said. ""We are surprised that Stop Hinkley says we haven't addressed the NFLA's points. ""There is an entire section in our final decision document specifically dedicated to the NFLA's comments."" The agency also denied that the methodology used to assess the radioactive impact was inadequate. Stop Hinkley is now calling for the permits to be revoked and for its submissions to be answered in full before they can be re-issued. The agency said: ""We believe we have answered their submissions in full and there is no reason why we should revoke or reconsider the permits we have issued.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
'Law change needed' to stop sale of 'legal highs',"The Local Government Association (LGA) - which represents 400 councils - wants the government to adopt a similar approach to that taken in Ireland. Instead of banning drugs on a case-by-case basis, Ireland has banned all ""psychoactive"" - brain altering - drugs and then exempted some such as alcohol. The LGA says this is the only way to protect young people. 'Vigorous' laws needed Deaths from so-called legal highs have more than doubled in the past four years - from 26 in 2009 to 60 last year. Currently in the UK a decision on whether a product is allowed to be sold is made on a case-by-case basis. The LGA says that when one product is banned the makers change the chemical compound slightly and can then sell it legally in shops - dubbed ""headshops"". To stop this happening in Ireland a ban on all brain-altering drugs was made law in 2010, and then substances such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco were made exempt and allowed to be sold. Councillor Ann Lucas, chairman of the LGA's safer and stronger communities board, said: ""This is all about tackling the sellers. ""Legal high shops are becoming endemic to our high streets, which is why we are calling on the government to introduce robust and vigorous new laws to tackle them. ""The sooner we put these so-called headshops out of business for good, the better. A key priority is educating and informing younger people about the dangers and risks of these drugs and councils play a pivotal role in this."" 'Notoriously difficult' Director at Public Health England (PHE) Rosanna O'Connor said services needed to be ""geared up"" to account for changing patterns of drug use. She said PHE was strengthening its own efforts to tackle use of new and emerging substances and was working with national and local partners to ""raise awareness of the risks... prevent problems where possible and ensure treatment services are able to help people"". Ms O'Connor said she was monitoring the use and impact of newer drugs to ""build a better picture of the scale of the problem"" and would feed any information into a pan-European early warning system. Councils spend about 30% - Â£830m a year - of their public health budget on drug and alcohol misuse, the LGA said. Legal highs, which include substances called ""Clockwork Orange"", ""Bliss"" and ""Mary Jane"", have been directly linked to emergency hospital admissions including in mental health services, the LGA said. Drug treatment charity Addaction said it was ""notoriously difficult"" to control legal highs because so much of their trade took place online. ""Any regulatory measures must be accompanied by education, support, advice and - in serious cases - specialist treatment,"" the charity said.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Jeff Koons' Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist,"Christie's in New York sold Rabbit, a 41in (104cm) steel cast of an inflatable created in 1986, for more than $20m over its estimated price. It beats the previous record set by British artist David Hockney in November. Art dealer Robert Mnuchin reportedly made the winning bid. Mr Mnuchin, father of US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, purchased the sculpture on behalf of a client, reports say. On its website Christie's described Rabbit as ""cute, sinister, cartoonish, imposing, vacuous, sexy, chilling, dazzling and iconic"". It is one of Jeff Koons' most well-known pieces. The US artist's sculptures have provoked controversy for decades after he emerged as a leading figure in New York's art scene in the 1980s. Koons previously held the record price for a living artist's work for his piece Balloon Dog (Orange). But he was overtaken last year by Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which sold for just over $90m at the same auction house. The sale comes in the same week a Claude Monet Haystacks painting sold in New York for $110.7m - a record for the French artist. What reaction has there been? The record price - and the artwork itself - has received a mixed reaction on social media. Despite the sculpture's iconic status, critics have questioned whether it is worth the price it fetched at auction. CNBC wealth reporter Robert Frank seemed taken aback by the price, tweeting: ""Still trying to get my head - and arms - around this."" Author Steve Silberman was rather more withering in his assessment. Some appeared outraged that the US treasury secretary's father was behind the winning bid. Steven Mnuchin was nominated in November 2016 to serve as US Secretary of the Treasury after a decades-long career working for hedge funds and investment bank Goldman Sachs. In a tweet, art critic Deborah Solomon said she found it ""problematic"" that Mr Mnuchin - a former Goldman Sachs banker himself - purchased the sculpture. Political commentator and Democratic strategist Peter Daou expressed similar sentiments. Journalist Carolina Miranda focused her ire on the art market, writing that it is ""really a bunch of billionaires swapping money and Jeff Koons"". Designer Dwayne Cyrus, however, was more positive, tweeting that the sale proves ""an artist can be profitable"".",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Covid: Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix called off for second year,"The events were due to be held from 22 August until 3 September.

Enterprise Minister Laurence Skelly said that while the decision was ""regrettable"", it would ""provide clarity and certainty"". Organised by the island's government and Manx Motor Cycle Club (MMCC) respectively, the races are run on the island's Mountain Course. Supporting the decision to cancel this year's races, MMCC chairman Peter Maddocks said the government ""clearly had no real option"". He said it was ""undoubtedly a huge disappointment for everyone associated with the races"". 'Prioritise health' The Isle of Man border has been closed to almost all non-residents for nearly 12 months. Financial support for businesses in the tourist industry, which has been maintained throughout the pandemic, will continue. Mr Skelly said: ""Despite the undoubted progress that the Isle of Man and the UK are making in rolling out its vaccination programme, the central issue of the availability of sufficient marshals, medics and other race officials to run the event safely and effectively remains. ""We also have to prioritise the health and wellbeing of the island's residents, and the sustainability of our own health service, through managing our island's border protocols, allowing medical professionals both on the island, and those that come over to support the event, to instead be able to concentrate on the ongoing medical challenges presented by the global pandemic.""

National Museum Wales boss issues job cuts warning,"By Huw ThomasBBC Wales arts and media correspondent David Anderson spoke to BBC Wales after making an offer to staff involved in a long-running pay dispute over ending ""premium payments"" to weekend staff. Strikes by the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union have hit museums. One union official said the proposals ""attacked"" the terms and conditions of workers who gave up their own weekends. But Mr Anderson said public sector spending cuts had forced a review of NMW's staff costs and he urged workers to accept the museum's ""best offer"". ""There's only a certain number of options we have and if we don't make the savings on the staff costs then we have to do it in terms of the galleries and the buildings and the sites, or not having any new exhibitions, or closing down our education services,"" he added. ""Those are the things we spend the money on, so those are our choices. We wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't preserve our services as well as preserving staff."" NMW runs seven sites; National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, National Waterfront Museum in Swansea, Big Pit in Blaenavon, Torfaen, National Roman Legion Museum in Newport, the National Wool Museum in Llandysul, Carmarthenshire, and the Welsh Slate Museum in Llanberis, Gwynedd. PCS is conducting an indicative ballot to assess whether its members will accept the latest proposal. The result will be known by 2 October and it will then decide whether to hold a full vote on the issue. Neil Harrison, the PCS union's branch chairman at National Museum Wales, said he did not believe ""affordability"" was a factor in the proposed changes to staff payments. ""What lies at the heart of this is an attempt by management to remove weekend payments,"" he said. ""It's an attack on the terms and conditions of those people who have to give up their weekends so that other people can come with their families to enjoy the national museums."" Dozens of strikes have forced the museum's sites across Wales to close at various times during the course of the dispute since 2014. 'Austerity storm' Mr Anderson said he had returned Â£30,000 of bonuses he had been eligible for in recent years and staff on higher pay grades had been subject to a pay freeze. The museum said its latest offer to workers involved in the dispute includes a 6% increase in basic pay, plus a further two years' worth of premium payments equivalent to an average payout of Â£3,600. It will also guarantee the lowest paid staff will not ""lose out"" through the process. A spokesman said: ""We feel that in the present economic circumstances where, like everybody else in the public sector in the UK, we've had a loss in real terms of about 25% of our budget in the last few years. ""This is a very fair offer that we're making in the middle of an austerity storm.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
The many ways to say sorry in Japanese,"In English, you either say ""sorry"" or ""apologies"". In Japanese, there are at least 20 different ways. One of the most casual and most frequently used words is ""gomen"" ããã. You can make it more formal by saying ""gomen-nasai"" ããããªãã or more friendly with ""gomen-ne"" ãããã­. ""Warui warui"" æªãæªã or ""my bad"" is also a very casual way to say sorry. ""Sumimasen"" ãã¿ã¾ãã, which can be translated as ""excuse me"", also works as an apology depending on how it is used. ""Yurushite"" è¨±ãã¦ is to ask for forgiveness and ""kanben"" åå¼ can be used to plead for mercy and both terms are used much more casually than in English. Viewpoint: Why do Japanâs apologies get disregarded? More formal ways to apologise include ""moushiwake nai"" ç³ãè¨³ãªã and ""shazai"" è¬ç½ª. But I use both terms quite often in business emails not because I really feel bad but just to be polite. For example, I may begin my correspondence with ""I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you"" and end it with ""I apologise for creating extra work for you"" even if it only took me a few days to respond and even if I was merely asking them to do what's already in their job description. 'I am reconsidering the past' If I genuinely want to apologise, at least three or four different phrases would appear in one short email. I may be ""too embarrassed to face you"" åãããé¡ããªã and ""I have no excuse"" å¼è§£ã®ä½å°ããªã for whatever I did. For the post-war apologies, Japanese leaders have used the word ""hansei"" åç much more frequently. In the English transcript, it reads ""remorse"" but I would translate it as ""regret"" and use it, for example, for failing to be more productive on my day off. A student would be told to ""hansei"" for forgetting to do one's homework. Its Chinese or Korean equivalents - ""fÇnshÃ¨"" or ""banseong"" respectively - also mean ""reflection on"" or ""reconsideration of"" the past. The 1995 statement by former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was considered landmark because it included the word ""owabi"" ãè©«ã³ which is one of the most formal ways of apologising. He said his country had caused ""tremendous damage and suffering"" through its ""colonial rule and aggression"" and expressed ""deep remorse"" and stated his ""heartfelt apology"". Ten years later to mark 60 years since the end of the World War Two, the then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi also used the term ""owabi"". Mr Koizumi's apology, however, was overshadowed by his repeated visits to the controversial Yasukuni shrine where all the war dead - including Class A war criminals - are enshrined. The current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also included the word ""owabi"" in his war anniversary statement but he had indicated that he would not visit the Yasukuni shrine on Saturday.",Human,English,BBC,,,1
Damascus military facilities 'hit by Israel rockets',"Syrian state media said the rockets hit the Jamraya research centre, which Western officials have suggested is involved in chemical weapons research. Israeli radio quoted a senior security official confirming an attack, and sources said it targeted weapons bound for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. It is the second suspected Israeli strike in Syria in two days. On Friday Israeli aircraft hit a shipment of missiles near the Lebanon border, according to unnamed US and Israeli officials. The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the latest developments are a significant escalation in Israel's involvement in the conflict. She says Israel has already responded to fears of retaliation by locating two batteries of its Iron Dome missile defence system near Haifa, close to the Lebanese border. 'Mild earthquake' Damascus was shaken by repeated explosions coming from the north-western suburbs. Amateur video footage and eye witness testimony suggested rocket attacks had hit weapons dumps, triggering dramatic orange-flamed blasts. The area houses numerous military facilities, including the Jamraya research centre, designated by Syria as a scientific research centre ""in charge of raising our level of resistance and self-defence"". A state TV bulletin said: ""The new Israeli attack is an attempt to raise the morale of the terrorist groups, which have been reeling from strikes by our noble army."" Damascus-based journalist Alaa Ebrahim told the BBC it was ""the biggest explosion"" the city had seen since the conflict began two years ago. He said residents living near Jamraya reported feeling a ""mild earthquake"" just before the blast, indicating that the rockets may have hit an underground facility. He added that the Syrian army was likely to have suffered major casualties in the attack. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted eyewitnesses in the area as saying they saw jets in the sky at the time of the explosions. The Jamraya facility was also apparently hit in an Israeli air strike in January. Israeli officials confirmed the January strike, but insisted it had targeted trucks carrying missiles to Hezbollah. After the latest attack, unnamed Western intelligence sources have again said the target was a weapons cache heading for Lebanon. Israel has repeatedly said it would act if it felt advanced weapons were being transferred to militant groups in the region, especially Hezbollah. 'Horrific reports' Analysts say the air strikes are unlikely to have a major effect on the civil war in Syria. The latest reports from coastal regions around the town of Baniyas suggest dozens of Sunnis have been massacred in a campaign of sectarian cleansing. The government said it had pushed back ""terrorist groups"" and restored security to the area. The US said it was ""appalled by the horrific reports"" but that it did not foresee sending US troops to Syria. However, the US is no longer ruling out supplying weapons to the rebels.

Caption mix-ups 'show lack of respect' for black MPs,"The Evening Standard used a picture of Bell Ribeiro-Addy in a story about fellow Labour MP Marsha de Cordova. The story was about BBC Parliament captioning Ms de Cordova as Labour deputy leadership hopeful Dawn Butler. Ms Ribeiro-Addy told BBC News: ""We are not given the same respect as our white counterparts and that's not right."" The MP, who has represented Streatham, in south London, since last year's general election, said she accepted that ""everybody makes mistakes,"" but added: ""It happens all the time with us. ""It is hard enough for us to get elected here but when we do get here we are not treated as individuals."" She said she used to get mistaken for Dawn Butler when she worked as the chief of staff to shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, ""because I must be the other one"". The BBC Parliament channel's mistake came during a Commons debate on the Agriculture Bill on Monday. Tweeting a photo of the incorrect caption, Ms Butler said: ""I love my sister @MarshadeCordova but we are two different people. ""Marsha is amazing and deserves to be called by her own name. Diversity in the workplace matters and it also helps to avoid making simple mistakes like this."" Ms de Cordova, who is Labour's shadow minister for disabled people, said the BBC's mistake was ""not OK at all"". Part of the problem was the lack of diversity in most newsrooms, Ms Ribeiro-Addy said, and the tendency of journalists to treat Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) MPs as part of a homogenous group. ""Why do so many MPs get to be individuals and we just get to be part of a group that gets confused with each other?"" The BBC ""sincerely apologised"" to Ms Butler and Ms de Cordova for the mistake. A spokesperson said: ""Sometimes we incorrectly identify MPs at the moment when they stand to speak. This error was immediately corrected on screen."" The Standard blamed picture agency Getty Images, which also supplies images to the BBC, for incorrectly captioning an image of Ms Ribeiro-Addy as Ms de Cordova. Getty Images ""sincerely apologised"" for incorrectly captioning the image of Ms Ribeiro-Addy and issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the two MPs ""for any offence this may have caused"". A Getty spokeswoman said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the error by the Evening Standard, we corrected the caption information on our website and in a notice sent to customers. ""Getty Images holds itself to a high standard of editorial integrity and has robust measures in place to ensure our content ingestion process reflects these standards. ""Although these errors are relatively rare, we, like all news agencies, regret when these measures fail to capture inaccuracies."" Tottenham MP David Lammy, one of the longest-serving black MPs, tweeted: ""This cannot go on. Black people are not all the same. We need more diversity in our newsrooms.""",Human,English,BBC,,,1
