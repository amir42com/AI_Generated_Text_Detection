In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture.

Scientific realism,"One of the main arguments for scientific realism centers on the notion that scientific knowledge is progressive in nature, and that it is able to predict phenomena successfully. Many scientific realists (e.g., Ernan McMullin, Richard Boyd) think the operational success of a theory lends credence to the idea that its more unobservable aspects exist, because they were how the theory reasoned its predictions. For example, a scientific realist would argue that science must derive some ontological support for atoms from the outstanding phenomenological success of all the theories using them.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Alfonso VI of León and Castile,"Shortly after, Alfonso VI cunningly defeated a conspiracy of his sons-in-law Raymond and Henry who had plotted to divide the kingdom at his death.

Clerical celibacy,"One interpretation of ""the husband of one wife"" is that the man to be ordained could not have been married more than once and that perfect continence, total abstinence, was expected from him starting on the day of his ordination. Usually these also conclude that, because of the exclusion of sexual relations, the members of the clergy were not entitled to marry after ordination.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Robert Bresson,"Initially also a photographer, Bresson made his first short film, ""Les affaires publiques"" (""Public Affairs"") in 1934. During World War II, he spent over a year in a prisoner-of-war camp−an experience which informs ""Un condamné à mort s'est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut"" (""A Man Escaped""). In a career that spanned fifty years, Bresson made only 13 feature-length films. This reflects his meticulous approach to the filmmaking process and his non-commercial preoccupations. Difficulty finding funding for his projects was also a factor.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
George Pell,"In 1990, Pell stated publicly that while he recognised that homosexuality existed, such activity was nevertheless wrong and ""for the good of society it should not be encouraged."" He has also expressed his belief that suicide linked to homophobia was a valid reason to discourage recognition of a gay identity, arguing that ""Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking."" He opposed Australian legislation in 2006 that would have permitted gay couples to adopt children. In 2007, Pell said that discrimination against people that are gay was not comparable to that against racial minorities.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Courtesan,"This was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor's spouse and the courtesan's spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved.

Johan Sverdrup,"During the 60s, the views towards the ministers' participation in the parliamentary sessions had changed totally. The ministerials, as they were called, were now univocally against, because they had seen the formation of the peasants' friends as a threat to what they deemed to be the ideal, the totally independent representative. The peasants and the radicals on the other hand, had drawn the obviously correct conclusion that this reform would further the influence of the elected towards the appointed ministers.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1

Retaining wall,"Retaining walls are relatively rigid walls used for supporting the soil mass laterally so that the soil can be retained at different levels on the two sides. Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Asian carp,"Asian carp have been a popular food fish in Asia for thousands of years. Some recipes are specifically for carp such as (sweet-and-sour carp) and (thick miso soup with carp). However, many people in North America do not distinguish the various Asian carp species and see them all as undesirable food fish due to their perceived bottom-feeding behavior, while, in fact, only some species are bottom-feeders, and even the bottom-feeding species such as the common carp, a highly bony species which was introduced to North America from Eurasia in the 1800s, are important food fish outside North America.",Human,Wikipedia,English,,,1
Woodstock (song),"Although Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young had learned the song from Joni Mitchell herself, the band's version slightly rearranged the lyrics from her original.

Colosseum,"The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use. By the late 6th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater, though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole. The arena was converted into a cemetery. The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops, and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the 12th century.
