Instead, the giro was guaranteed by the Post Office and could be cashed at any post office branch.

The worm can grow to be up to 10 meters in length.",Ai,Wikipedia,English,Continue,gemini-pro,0

Dromedary,"The dromedary and the Bactrian camel often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia, and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of the introgression of alleles.
