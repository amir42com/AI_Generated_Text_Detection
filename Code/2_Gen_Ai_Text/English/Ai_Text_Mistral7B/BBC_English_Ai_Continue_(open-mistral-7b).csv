"'Prison was holiday camp compared to forced labour', court hears","Patrick Joseph Connors, 59, Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and Lee Carbis, 34, stood before the Old Bailey criminal court, each denying several offenses involving forced labor and exploitation. The courtroom was filled with an anticipation that hung heavy in the air as the prosecution presented the first witnesses. The lead witness, Michael Hughes, a man of 46 years, was called to the stand. Hughes, a former employee of the defendants, painted a vivid picture of the working conditions that he and his colleagues had been subjected to. He described the farm where they had worked as a ""disgusting and inhumane place,"" with filthy living quarters and long hours, often in harsh weather conditions. However, Hughes also offered a surprising contrast to the grim working conditions. He testified that, despite the hardships, the defendants had often treated them to luxuries that seemed out of place on a working farm. Hughes recalled that the defendants had spent thousands of pounds on entertainment, including trips to the cinema, meals out, and even holidays to the coast. ""It was like a holiday camp compared to the forced labor we were subjected to,"" Hughes told the court. ""We were working long hours, often without a day off, and living in squalid conditions. But then, out of nowhere, we'd be taken to the seaside or given tickets to the cinema. It just didn't make any sense."" The prosecution argued that these gestures were part of a calculated strategy to keep the workers compliant and prevent them from speaking out about the working conditions. The defendants' lawyers countered that their clients had simply wanted to treat their workers well and that there was no intention to exploit or force labor. As the trial continued, the court heard testimony from other former employees who corroborated Hughes' account of the working conditions. However, they also echoed his descriptions of the unexpected treats and holidays. The court was left to weigh the evidence and determine whether the defendants had indeed subjected their workers to forced labor or if the situation was more complex than it first appeared. The trial was ongoing, and the outcome remained uncertain. But one thing was clear: the case had shed new light on the complexities of labor exploitation and the ways in which it could be masked by seemingly benevolent gestures. The courtroom audience, consisting of lawyers, journalists, and members of the public, listened intently as the evidence was presented, eager to understand the full story behind the allegations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Delhi rape: PM promises to pursue panel recommendations,"Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister of India, wrote to the head of the Justice Verma Commission, Justice JS Verma, expressing his commitment to promptly take up the recommendations put forward in the report following the heinous Delhi gang rape case in 2013. The Commission, established to review and suggest amendments to the criminal laws in the wake of the horrific incident, called for various measures to enhance the safety and security of women in India. The report, which drew widespread attention both domestically and internationally, suggested several significant changes, including faster trials and longer sentences for convicted rapists. However, it did not call for the death penalty, as had been demanded by some sections of society in the aftermath of the incident. Singh, in his letter, acknowledged the gravity of the issue and reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of women in the country. He also assured that the recommendations would be taken up in a comprehensive and inclusive manner, involving all stakeholders. The panel, which comprised of Justice JS Verma, former Law Commission chairman GS Singhvi, and human rights activist Leela Dube, submitted its report in January 2013, proposing several far-reaching changes to the criminal laws, including the introduction of the death penalty for repeat offenders and the rape of children under 12 years of age, and the establishment of fast-track courts to deal with sexual offences. The report also recommended the setting up of a registry of sex offenders, changes to the definition of consent, and the establishment of a National Commission for Women and a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. It further called for the setting up of a helpline for women to report crimes and the creation of a database of all FIRs related to crimes against women. The Government, in response to the report, constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) to oversee the implementation of the recommendations. The GoM, chaired by the Home Minister, included ministers from the Law and Justice, Women and Child Development, and Finance ministries. The GoM was mandated to submit a progress report to the Cabinet within three months. The recommendations of the Justice Verma Commission were a watershed moment in India's efforts to tackle the issue of sexual violence against women. The report, which was widely hailed as a bold step towards ensuring the safety and security of women, paved the way for several important legislative and administrative changes in the country. However, despite the progress made, much work remains to be done to ensure that the recommendations are effectively implemented and that women in India are truly safe from the spectre of sexual violence. The challenge for the government and society as a whole is to build on the momentum generated by the Justice Verma Commission report and to forge a collective effort to create a safe and secure environment for women in India.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Vulnerable adult abuse cases in Wales rise by 11%,"The Welsh Government, which compiled the latest figures on adult protection referrals in Wales, has reported a concerning 11% rise in vulnerable adult abuse cases between the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years. This increase brings the total number of completed referrals to 4,485. Neglect (36%) and physical abuse (32%) were the most reported types of abuse, accounting for over two-thirds of all cases. Neglect refers to the failure to provide for an adult's basic physical, emotional, or social needs, while physical abuse encompasses any non-accidental physical injury inflicted upon an adult. Financial abuse (12%) was the third most common form of reported abuse. This category includes the misappropriation, misuse or theft of an adult's money, property, or assets. Emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse each accounted for less than 10% of cases. The majority of referrals (61%) were made by professionals, with family members and friends making up 29% of reports. The remaining 10% were made by the police, other agencies, or self-referrals. The Welsh Government stated that the increase in reported cases could be due to a number of factors, including improved awareness and reporting, the ageing population, and the availability of more resources for reporting and investigating cases. However, despite the rise in reported cases, there are concerns that not all instances of abuse are being identified and reported. A recent report by the Public Accounts Committee found that local authorities in Wales were not effectively identifying and responding to cases of adult abuse. The Welsh Government has pledged to invest an additional Â£2.5 million in adult social care services over the next year to help address the issue. This funding will be used to improve the identification and reporting of abuse, as well as to support victims and their families. The Welsh Government's Minister for Social Services and Public Health, Rebecca Evans, said: ""It is concerning that there has been an increase in the number of adult protection referrals. Behind each of these figures is a real person who has been harmed or at risk of harm. We must do everything we can to ensure that we are doing all we can to prevent abuse and neglect, and to support those who have been affected."" The Welsh Government has also launched a new campaign, 'See Something, Do Something', to encourage people to report any suspicions of adult abuse or neglect. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the issue and to encourage people to take action if they suspect that someone they know is being harmed. Despite the progress being made, there is still much work to be done to address the issue of vulnerable adult abuse in Wales. The rise in reported cases is a reminder that this is a complex and serious problem that requires a coordinated and sustained response",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Call for commissioner to fight for autism and learning disability rights,"The three charities, the National Autistic Society, Mencap, and the Learning Disability England, have launched a powerful call for the appointment of a Commissioner for Autism and Learning Disability Rights in England. The charities assert that families are at their wit's end, having long exhaustedly fought for the essential support and recognition as equal citizens that they deserve. They argue that a Commissioner would bridge the current chasm between the laws that exist on paper and the reality experienced by those with autism and learning disabilities. The charities' statement comes in the wake of a recent report that revealed an alarming 71% increase in autism diagnoses in the past five years. This surge in diagnoses underscores the urgent need for robust action to address the systemic issues faced by those with autism and learning disabilities. The charities contend that a Commissioner would lead this charge, ensuring that the rights enshrined in laws such as the Equality Act 2010 are actively upheld and not merely paid lip service. ""We know that families are at breaking point,"" said Mark Lever, Chief Executive of the National Autistic Society. ""They're struggling to access the support they need, and they're facing discrimination and misunderstanding every day. A Commissioner for Autism and Learning Disability Rights would be a powerful voice for change, ensuring that the voices of those who are often overlooked and undervalued are heard at the highest levels of government."" The proposed Commissioner would have the power to investigate and tackle discriminatory practices, drive forward policy changes, and hold public services to account. They would also serve as a critical link between government and the community, providing a platform for individuals with autism and learning disabilities to share their experiences and shape the direction of policy and service provision. ""What we're talking about here is not just about legal rights, but about real, tangible improvements in people's lives,"" said Jan Tregelles, Chief Executive of Mencap. ""A Commissioner would help to ensure that the promises made in law are translated into meaningful action on the ground. We know that this is a vital step towards creating a more inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their autism or learning disability, is valued and respected."" The call for a Commissioner for Autism and Learning Disability Rights has garnered widespread support from individuals, families, and organizations across the sector. The time for action is now, and the charities are urging the government to seize this opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of those with autism and learning disabilities. ""We cannot afford to wait any longer,"" added Viv Cooper, Chief Executive of Learning Disability England. ""The need for change is clear, and the potential benefits are immense. We urge the government to heed our call and appoint a Commissioner for Autism and Learning Disability Rights, so that we can begin to close the gap between the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bath and Bristol streets exceed EU pollution levels,"By Luke Hanrahan, BBC News Bath and Bristol in the southwest of England have been identified as having streets with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels exceeding the European Union (EU) limit. According to data from Bath and North East Somerset and Bristol City Councils, some roads in these cities have NO2 levels more than twice the EU maximum. Bristol City Council stated, ""We are deeply concerned about the high levels of nitrogen dioxide on some of our roads, especially those in the city centre. The health impacts of this pollution are a major concern for us, and we are taking action to address the issue."" The EU limit for NO2 is set at 40 micrograms per cubic metre (Âµg/mÂ³) over an annual average. However, data from the councils revealed that in some areas of Bath and Bristol, the annual average NO2 concentrations were above 80 Âµg/mÂ³. The most affected roads in Bath were identified as London Road, James Street, and Manvers Street, while in Bristol, the A38 Gloucester Road, A38 Bedminster Parade, and A38 Victoria Street were highlighted as having high NO2 levels. The sources of this pollution are primarily attributed to road traffic, with diesel vehicles being a significant contributor. The councils have encouraged the use of public transport, cycling, or walking instead of driving to help reduce emissions. Bath and North East Somerset Council stated, ""We are working closely with the local community and partners to address this issue. This includes the promotion of sustainable travel options, the implementation of Low Emission Zones, and the improvement of air quality monitoring networks."" Bristol City Council, in collaboration with the West of England Combined Authority, is also exploring the possibility of introducing a Clean Air Zone (CAZ) in the city to help tackle the issue. CAZs are areas where the most polluting vehicles are required to pay a daily charge to enter. The councils have called upon the government to provide additional funding to support their efforts in addressing air pollution. They argue that more resources are needed to implement effective measures and to raise public awareness about the health risks associated with high levels of NO2. The high NO2 levels have led to public concern, with many residents expressing their frustration and disappointment. One local resident, Jane Thompson, stated, ""I am deeply worried about the health implications of this pollution, especially for my children. We need action to be taken urgently to address this issue and protect our health."" The councils have assured the public that they are doing all they can to tackle the issue of air pollution and improve the air quality in their respective cities. They have urged the government to provide further support and resources to help them in their efforts.

William Roache trial: Girl 'humiliated and ashamed after rapes',"The woman, now 62, took a deep breath as she recounted the painful memories of the two alleged rapes that took place at the hands of William Roache at his homes in Haslingden, Lancashire, on separate occasions. The courtroom was filled with a heavy silence as she spoke, the weight of her words hanging in the air. Roache, 81, denies the allegations made by the woman, who came forward in 2013. The alleged incidents occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the woman was a young adult. The woman's voice wavered as she described the emotional turmoil she experienced in the years following the alleged attacks. ""I was humiliated and ashamed,"" she testified. ""I couldn't tell anyone what had happened to me. I felt like it was my fault, like I had brought it upon myself. I withdrew from my friends and family, and I couldn't bring myself to go out in public. I was consumed by depression and anxiety."" The jury heard that the woman's mental health suffered greatly in the aftermath of the alleged rapes. She was diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was prescribed medication to help manage her symptoms. The woman's testimony was followed by that of several other women, who also accused Roache of sexual assaults that allegedly took place during the same time period. The allegations span several decades, with some dating back to the 1960s. Roache's legal team has argued that the allegations are unreliable due to the passage of time and the inconsistencies in the women's accounts. However, the woman's testimony was clear and detailed, and she was able to provide specific details about the alleged incidents, including the locations and the clothing she was wearing. Roache, who is best known for his role as Ken Barlow in Coronation Street, has maintained his innocence throughout the trial. He has denied all of the allegations against him, and his legal team has argued that the women are making false accusations. The trial, which is now in its third week, is expected to continue for several more days as the prosecution and defense present their cases to the jury. The outcome of the trial will have significant implications for Roache's career and personal life, as well as for the women who have come forward with allegations against him. As the courtroom listened intently to the woman's testimony, it was clear that the trial was about more than just the allegations against William Roache. It was about the impact of sexual assault on the lives of the survivors, and the importance of speaking out and seeking justice, no matter how long it may take.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
London 2012: India 'to raise role of Dow Chemical',"The sports ministry of India expressed its concerns to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) over the participation of Dow Chemical in the London 2012 Olympic Games, due to the company's controversial links to the Bhopal gas leak disaster. ""There is strong public sentiment on this issue,"" a ministry spokesperson said, adding that the Indian government would not turn a blind eye to the concerns raised by citizens. The Bhopal gas leak, which occurred in 1984, is considered one of the world's worst industrial disasters, leaving thousands dead and tens of thousands more affected by the toxic gas. Dow Chemical acquired Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster, in 2001. While Dow maintains that it has no legal liability for the disaster, it has faced criticism for its failure to take responsibility and provide adequate compensation to the affected communities. The IOA, which is responsible for selecting and managing the Indian contingent to international sports events, has defended its decision to allow Dow to sponsor the Indian team. ""Dow has been a long-term supporter of the Olympic Movement and has been providing support to various National Olympic Committees, including India,"" an IOA spokesperson said. However, the issue has sparked widespread controversy in India, with many questioning the ethical implications of allowing a company with such a controversial past to sponsor the national team. Activists have called for a boycott of the Dow-sponsored Indian team and have demanded that the government take action. The issue has also drawn international attention, with human rights groups and activists calling on the Olympic Committee and other international sports bodies to take a stand against Dow's involvement in the Games. The Bhopal Gas Peoples' Action Group, an organization representing the affected communities, has urged the Olympic Committee to revoke Dow's sponsorship of the Games. ""Dow's involvement in the London 2012 Olympics sends a wrong message to the world. It sends a message that the company can continue to profit from its past atrocities,"" Rachna Dhingra, a spokesperson for the group, said. Meanwhile, Dow has defended its involvement in the Games, saying that it is committed to making a positive contribution to the Olympic Movement. ""Dow is proud to be a long-term supporter of the Olympic Movement and is committed to making a positive impact on communities around the world,"" a Dow spokesperson said. The controversy over Dow's involvement in the London 2012 Olympics is a reminder of the complex ethical issues that arise when corporations sponsor major sporting events. While sports can bring people together and promote unity and peace, they can also be used to whitewash the reputation of controversial companies and distract from their past misdeeds.

Poland profile - Overview,"There have been periods of independence as well as periods of domination by other countries in Poland's rich history. This Eastern European nation has experienced significant political and cultural shifts throughout the centuries. Poland's modern history began in the late 18th century when it was partitioned among Prussia, Austria, and Russia. The country regained its independence after World War I but was invaded again in 1939, marking the beginning of World War II. During this dark period, several million people, half of them Jews, lost their lives. The Holocaust left an indelible mark on Poland's history. A new era began when Poland became one of the founding members of the United Nations in 1945. The post-war years were marked by political instability and economic hardship. However, in the late 1980s, the Solidarity trade union led a peaceful revolution, leading to the establishment of a democratic government in 1989. Since then, Poland has been a parliamentary democracy and a member of the European Union since 2004. Poland is the sixth most populous country in the European Union with a population of approximately 38 million. Its capital and largest city is Warsaw, while Krakow is known for its historic center and was the former capital of the country. Other major cities include Lodz, Poznan, Wroclaw, and Gdansk. Poland is located in Central Europe and shares borders with seven countries: Germany to the west, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and Belarus to the east, and Lithuania and the Baltic Sea to the north. Its geography is diverse, with flat plains, rolling hills, and mountains. Poland's economy is the sixth largest in the European Union and is characterized by a market economy with a significant agricultural sector. The country is rich in natural resources, including coal, natural gas, timber, and minerals. Poland joined the European Monetary Union in 2012 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2016. Polish culture is diverse and vibrant, reflecting its rich history. Polish food is renowned for its heartiness and deliciousness, with dishes such as pierogi, bigos, and kielbasa being popular both in Poland and abroad. The country is also home to a thriving arts scene, with renowned painters, sculptors, and musicians hailing from Poland. Poland is a democratic parliamentary republic with a President as the head of state and a Prime Minister as the head of government. The country has a multi-party system, with the main political forces being the Law and Justice Party, the Civic Platform, and the Polish People's Party.

Eminem attacks Trump in freestyle rap at BET Hip Hop Awards,"In a fiery and unapologetic performance at the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday night, Eminem took aim at President Donald Trump in a four-and-a-half minute freestyle rap that left the audience stunned. The Detroit rapper, known for his provocative and politically charged lyrics, did not hold back in his scathing critique of the president. ""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of any sort, I mean, I'm despising the person you've become,"" Eminem began, addressing Trump directly. ""And I'm dissing a fan base that includes you. 'Cause I don't give a damn about being politically correct, I call 'em how I see 'em and in this moment, you're the biggest disaster."" The rapper then went on to label Trump a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa,"" and criticized his handling of the Charlottesville protests and the NFL national anthem controversy. ""You're a bully, plain and simple, and if you're a fan of mine, it's time to make some changes,"" Eminem continued. ""'Cause what we're doing is just a circling of the drain."" The crowd at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles erupted in cheers as Eminem delivered his harsh words, many in the audience waving their cellphones in the air in support. The rapper's performance came just a week after Trump made headlines for disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles from the White House after they announced they would not attend the celebration due to a disagreement over the national anthem protests. Eminem also took aim at Trump supporters, urging them to reconsider their allegiance to the president. ""If you're a white American, and you're living in the midst of poverty, I'm with you,"" he rapped. ""But let's make sure it's the party that cares about equality, 'cause it's not the (expletive) party, let's get that clear, 'cause what we're doing is just a circular economy."" The rapper's politically charged performance was a stark contrast to the generally lighter and more celebratory tone of the BET Hip Hop Awards. But for Eminem, it was a moment to speak his truth and challenge his fans to do the same. ""So many of his fans, they're gonna defend him, they're gonna say, 'He's doing a good job for us,'"" Eminem said. ""But the truth is, I've been to the border, I've seen it, I've spoken with the mothers and fathers, I've seen the tears in their eyes, and it's heartbreaking, and it's not right, so if you're watching this and you",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Three teenagers arrive in Fiji after Pacific ordeal,"The boys, from the Tokelau Islands, a New Zealand-administered territory in the South Pacific, had been given up for dead after an unsuccessful search. The three teenagers, Sione, Taulapapa, and Vainetu, had set out on a small fishing boat to visit their relatives in Tonga, but they had encountered a violent storm at sea. Their small boat was tossed about mercilessly by the waves, and the boys were thrown overboard several times. They managed to cling to debris and each other, but their boat was lost. For days they floated on the open sea, with little food and water, praying for rescue. But help seemed unlikely to come. The search and rescue team had scoured the area for several days, but they had found no trace of the missing boys. The boys' families and friends had held prayer vigils and offered sacrifices to their gods, but there seemed to be no answer. Then, miraculously, the boys were spotted by a passing fisherman. He had seen something unusual in the water and had paddled closer to investigate. When he saw the boys clinging to a piece of driftwood, he was astounded. The fisherman, whose name was Tuake, took the boys aboard his boat and brought them to the nearest village in Fiji. The villagers were amazed and relieved to see the boys alive. They had heard the reports of the search and rescue efforts and had assumed the worst. The boys were weak and emaciated, but they were alive. They were taken to the local clinic for medical treatment, and their families were informed of their survival. The news spread quickly through the islands, and the boys became the subject of much celebration and wonder. The boys' families were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons. They offered thanks to their gods for the miracle of their survival. Sione, Taulapapa, and Vainetu were hailed as heroes, and they were showered with gifts and praise. But the boys were humble and grateful. They knew that they had been lucky to survive, and they vowed to never take their lives for granted again. They would always remember the feeling of helplessness and despair they had experienced during their ordeal, and they would use their experience to inspire others. The boys' story was a reminder of the power of the human spirit and the importance of hope. They had faced the worst that the Pacific Ocean could offer, and they had emerged victorious.

Climate change to drive 'massive' investment shift,"Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has made a bold prediction about the future of investment trends. In his annual letter to shareholders, Fink stated that the shift towards sustainable investments, driven by climate change concerns, will happen ""sooner than most anticipate."" BlackRock's announcement comes as more investors are recognizing the financial risks posed by climate change and the importance of taking action to mitigate those risks. Fink's statement echoes similar sentiments expressed by other industry leaders, including the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. BlackRock's move towards sustainable investing is significant. The firm manages over $9 trillion in assets, making it a major player in the investment world. By offering ""sustainable"" versions of its traditional investment options, BlackRock is signaling to its clients that it takes the issue of climate change seriously and is committed to helping them manage the risks associated with it. The shift towards sustainable investing is already underway. In 2020, global sustainable assets under management reached a record $1 trillion, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. That figure is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The drivers of this trend are numerous. In addition to increasing concerns about climate change, there is also growing awareness of the potential financial risks posed by unsustainable business practices. Companies that are not taking steps to address these risks are increasingly being shunned by investors. Furthermore, there is evidence that sustainable investments can deliver strong financial returns. For example, a study by Oxford University found that sustainable funds outperformed their traditional counterparts over a 20-year period. The shift towards sustainable investing is not just limited to the world of finance. Governments and regulators are also taking action to address climate change and promote sustainable business practices. For example, the European Union has proposed a tax on carbon emissions, while the United States has re-joined the Paris Agreement on climate change. Despite these trends, there are still challenges to overcome. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of standardized definitions and metrics for what constitutes a sustainable investment. This can make it difficult for investors to compare different investment options and make informed decisions. Another challenge is the need for more data and transparency around companies' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. While there is growing demand for this information, there is still a lack of consistency and reliability in the data that is available. Despite these challenges, there is reason for optimism. The momentum towards sustainable investing is only growing, and companies that fail to adapt are likely to be left behind. As Larry Fink put it, ""Climate risk is investment risk. Companies that fail to address this risk will underperform those that do.""

It's an opportunity for budding young authors to showcase their talent and be recognized for their hard work. The Duchess of Cornwall, who is also a patron of the National Literacy Trust, emphasized the importance of literacy and the role it plays in shaping young minds. ""Writing is a powerful tool,"" she said. ""It can transport you to new worlds, help you understand complex ideas, and even give you a voice. But most importantly, it's a way to express yourself and share your thoughts and feelings with others."" The Duchess went on to share her own experiences with writing and how it has enabled her to connect with people from all walks of life. ""I've had the privilege of meeting some truly remarkable young writers through my work with literacy charities,"" she said.

Teenagers risk missing out on savings pots,"By Kevin Peachey, Personal Finance Reporter These funds, known as Child Trust Funds (CTFs), were set up by the Labour government in 2005 to encourage parents to save for their children and to promote financial awareness. They began with an automatic contribution from the government, but the scheme was later closed to new contributors in 2011. Now, as teenagers approach adulthood and become eligible to access their CTFs, there are concerns that many may miss out on the potential benefits of these savings pots. According to the Children's Commissioner for England, there are currently around 2.4 million CTFs in existence, but it's estimated that as many as one in three account holders may not be aware of their savings. The average CTF balance is estimated to be around Â£1,000, which may not seem like a significant amount. However, if left untouched and invested wisely, it could grow into a sizeable sum by the time the account holder reaches retirement age. The problem is that many teenagers are not financially literate enough to understand the importance of saving and investing. A recent survey by the Money and Pensions Service found that only 35% of 16-24-year-olds feel confident managing their money. Adding to the challenge is the fact that CTFs can be complex to manage. Some accounts may come with high fees or restrictions on how the money can be invested. Others may require the account holder to transfer the savings into a different account when they turn 18. To help teenagers navigate the complexities of their CTFs, there are several resources available. The Children's Commissioner's website offers a range of tools and advice on how to manage CTFs, including information on how to locate lost accounts and how to compare different savings products. Parents and guardians can also play a crucial role in helping teenagers understand the importance of saving and investing. They can encourage their children to research their CTFs and to consider their options carefully before making any decisions. For those who are eligible, accessing a CTF can be a great way to kick-start a lifelong habit of saving and investing. With the right guidance and support, these savings pots could provide a valuable financial boost for the next generation. However, for those who are unaware of their CTFs or who don't have the support they need to manage them effectively, the potential benefits may be lost. As we enter a new era of financial uncertainty, it's more important than ever that young people are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need to make the most of their savings. In conclusion, Child Trust Funds offer a valuable opportunity for teenagers to build a financial foundation for their future. However, with many accounts going unused, there is a risk that this generation may miss out on the potential benefits of these savings",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Call to extend EU settlement scheme pilot to include family members,"The EU Settlement Scheme pilot, which is set to begin next month, offers an opportunity for health and social care workers and university staff from the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, as well as their Swiss counterparts, to apply for settled status before the UK leaves the EU. This scheme, which is a crucial step towards securing their future in the UK, comes as part of the government's commitment to ensure that those who have made significant contributions to the country's economy and society are not left in limbo. However, there is a growing concern among EU nationals and their families that not everyone who is eligible for the scheme will be able to apply. The current setup only includes primary applicants, leaving out their close relatives. This omission could potentially result in thousands of families being separated, causing distress and uncertainty. A call has been made for the government to extend the EU Settlement Scheme pilot to include the families of the eligible applicants. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a leading independent organisation in the UK, has written to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, urging her to widen the scope of the scheme. The letter, which was signed by over 100 organisations and individuals, argues that families belong together and that separate applications for each family member would not only be a logistical challenge but also cause unnecessary stress and anxiety. The call for an extension of the pilot to include family members comes at a time when the importance of family unity has been highlighted more than ever. The current situation with the pandemic has shown that families play a vital role in supporting each other, both emotionally and financially. Separating families would not only be detrimental to them but would also have wider implications for the communities they live in and the UK as a whole. The government has acknowledged the importance of families and has previously stated that they want to ensure that families are kept together. However, it remains to be seen whether this commitment will translate into action in the context of the EU Settlement Scheme. The Home Office has been contacted for comment on the matter, but no official statement has been made yet. As the deadline for Brexit approaches, it is essential that the government takes a compassionate and pragmatic approach to the implementation of the EU Settlement Scheme. Extending the pilot to include family members would not only be the right thing to do from a moral perspective but would also help to reduce the administrative burden on both the applicants and the Home Office in the long run. It is hoped that the government will listen to the call of the organisations and individuals who are advocating for this extension and take swift action to ensure that families are not unnecessarily separated.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Climate action cannot be another Covid victim - PM,"By Justin Rowlatt, Chief environment correspondent The prime minister will tell a meeting hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres that climate action ""cannot be another Covid victim."" In a statement released ahead of the Leaders' Climate Summit on 23 September, Boris Johnson will emphasize the importance of maintaining momentum in the fight against climate change, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Johnson will join other world leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, in pledging new or updated climate targets. The UK prime minister is expected to announce a goal to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 78% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels. In his statement, Johnson will acknowledge the challenges posed by the pandemic, but he will argue that climate action must not be neglected. ""We have shown we can come together to address a common threat. Now we must do the same for our planet,"" he will say. ""The climate crisis is an existential threat that does not take a break for pandemics."" The prime minister will also highlight the economic opportunities of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. ""The transition to net zero is a golden opportunity to level up across the country, to create new industries, new jobs, and new prosperity,"" he will say. ""The future is green, and the UK will lead the way."" While Johnson's comments are likely to be welcomed by climate campaigners, some may argue that the UK government's actions do not fully match its rhetoric. Critics have pointed out that the UK has not yet published a detailed plan for how it will achieve its net-zero target, and that the government has failed to provide sufficient financial support to industries that are most at risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Johnson's message will also be closely watched by other world leaders, who are under increasing pressure to take bold action on climate change. The IPCC's latest report, published in August, warned that the world is currently on track for a temperature rise of 3Â°C by the end of the century, far above the 1.5Â°C target agreed in the Paris Agreement. The UN climate summit, which will be held virtually due to the pandemic, is seen as an opportunity for world leaders to make new commitments and to demonstrate their commitment to tackling the climate crisis. Johnson's remarks are likely to be seen as a sign that the UK remains committed to playing a leading role in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the worst impacts of climate change. However, the prime minister's message will also serve as a reminder that the pandemic has disrupted efforts to address the climate crisis, and that urgent action is needed to get back on track. ""We cannot let the response to Covid-19 divert us from our commitment to net zero,"" Johnson will say.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rotherham children's services 'transformed',"Rotherham Council's children's services have undergone a significant transformation following the damning report published in 2014, which found up to 1,400 children in the local authority area to have been subjected to abuse and neglect. The service had been judged to be failing, leaving many in the community calling for change and accountability. However, the latest Ofsted inspection, carried out in November 2021, paints a very different picture. The inspection team found that the local authority had made ""significant progress"" in improving the quality of services for children. The service has now been given an overall ""good"" rating, a major turnaround from just a few short years ago. Ofsted inspectors highlighted several areas where Rotherham Council had made particular progress. For instance, they noted that social workers were now more effective at identifying children in need and providing timely intervention. They also praised the authority's new approach to working with families, which emphasizes support and empowerment rather than punishment. The report also highlighted the importance of strong leadership within the council. Inspectors noted that senior managers had ""taken bold and decisive action to improve services,"" which had helped to create a culture of continuous improvement. But while there is much to celebrate, there are still areas where Rotherham Council must continue to focus its efforts. For example, the inspection team identified some weaknesses in the system for ensuring that children in care are placed in appropriate homes. They also noted that some children were still not receiving the support they needed to achieve good educational outcomes. Despite these challenges, however, the overall message from Ofsted is one of progress and improvement. The authority's chief executive, Graham Hatton, welcomed the report's findings, saying that ""this is a significant step forward in our journey to provide the best possible services for children and young people in Rotherham."" The transformation of Rotherham Council's children's services is a testament to the hard work and dedication of many individuals within the authority, as well as the support and commitment of the community. It is a reminder that even in the face of the most challenging circumstances, it is possible to make a difference and create a better future for vulnerable children and families. As the council continues to build on this progress, there will no doubt be further challenges and setbacks. But with strong leadership, a commitment to continuous improvement, and a focus on the needs of children and families, Rotherham Council is well-placed to continue its journey towards providing the best possible services for the children in its care.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ken Skates: Access to EU single market without free movement,"But Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian warned the Welsh Government should be ""advocating membership of the single market"" not just access during a National Assembly for Wales debate on the UK-EU trade relationship. She emphasized the importance of the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, which she considered essential for Welsh businesses. Gwenllian stated, ""We cannot have access without the four freedoms. Access without the free movement of people will be a hollow victory for Welsh businesses, particularly those in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, and education."" She added that Plaid Cymru would continue to push for full membership, as it was in the best interest of Wales and its economy. Caroline Jones, UKIP AM, disagreed, arguing that free movement of people hampered Wales' sovereignty and led to significant social and economic challenges. Jones stated, ""We do not want unrestricted access to the EU single market, which often comes with the cost of an unwanted free movement of people."" She urged the Welsh Government to prioritize the protection of Welsh jobs and borders and to work towards a trade deal that did not require the acceptance of the four freedoms. Ken Skates, the Welsh Minister for Economy and Transport, acknowledged the concerns of both parties while emphasizing the importance of securing the best deal for Wales. He said, ""We understand the importance of the single market to our businesses and are working to ensure we have the closest possible relationship with our European partners."" Skates added that the Welsh Government would explore all options, including membership and access, to achieve this goal. Labour AMs, such as Mark Drakeford and Huw Irranca-Davies, expressed their support for the Welsh Government's stance, emphasizing the need for a pragmatic approach that prioritized the interests of Welsh businesses and workers. They acknowledged that the UK's withdrawal from the EU would bring challenges but believed that a close relationship with Europe was crucial for Wales' economic success. The debate highlighted the complex nature of the UK's relationship with the EU and the various perspectives within the Welsh Assembly on how best to navigate this new landscape. As the UK and the EU continue their negotiations on the post-Brexit trade relationship, the Welsh Government will face significant pressure to secure a deal that benefits Welsh businesses and protects Welsh jobs while respecting the sovereignty of the Welsh people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Children's heart surgery: Edwin Poots to meet Irish minister,"Edwin Poots was speaking with fervor during a heated debate on the future of children's heart surgery in Belfast. The Northern Irish Health Minister's voice rang out across the chamber, addressing the concerns of legislators and the public. ""A report has said that while safe, the service at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children is facing significant challenges,"" he began. Poots acknowledged the findings of the recent investigation, which highlighted issues with the recruitment and retention of cardiothoracic surgeons in Northern Ireland. He emphasized the importance of the service, which saves the lives of young patients every year. ""We must remember that we are not just talking about numbers or statistics,"" Poots continued. ""We are talking about the lives of innocent children, many of whom travel long distances to receive the care they need."" Poots went on to announce that he would be meeting with his Irish counterpart, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, to discuss potential solutions to the crisis. ""I believe that by working together, we can find a way to address these challenges and secure a brighter future for our children's heart surgery service,"" he declared. The announcement was met with a mixture of relief and skepticism from the assembled legislators. Some expressed hope that the cross-border cooperation would lead to tangible progress, while others remained skeptical that any real solutions could be found. Meanwhile, parents of children who had undergone heart surgery at the hospital shared their stories of fear and uncertainty. One mother, whose son had undergone surgery just weeks before, spoke of her anxiety about the future of the service. ""I'm just glad my son's surgery was successful, but what about the other families? What about the children who need surgery in the future?"" she asked, her voice shaking with emotion. Despite the challenges, there was also a sense of determination and resilience among those who had been affected by the crisis. Parents, healthcare workers, and politicians all agreed that the children's heart surgery service was worth fighting for. As the debate drew to a close, Poots reiterated his commitment to finding a solution. ""This is not just a Northern Irish issue, or an Irish issue,"" he said. ""This is a human issue, and we must work together to ensure that our children receive the best possible care."" The meeting between Poots and Donnelly is expected to take place in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the future of children's heart surgery in Belfast remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the fight to secure its future is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Crab and lobster fishermen fear for their livelihoods,"They argue the traditional 'pot' method of fishing for crab and lobster is sustainable and that restrictions are not needed, according to local fishermen in Wales. This age-old technique, passed down through generations, allows them to selectively target these shellfish while minimizing bycatch and protecting the seabed. ""We've been doing this for years and it's worked for us,"" said Huw Morris, a third-generation crab fisherman from Aberystwyth. ""We're not overfishing, we're not damaging the seabed, and we're providing a valuable source of protein for people. There's no need for more regulations."" However, the Welsh Government has suggested that new measures may be necessary to ensure the long-term health of crab and lobster stocks. In response to concerns raised by the European Commission, the government has initiated a consultation process to gather information and opinions from stakeholders. ""We understand the importance of the fishing industry to local communities, and we want to work with them to find a sustainable solution,"" said a spokesperson for the Welsh Government. ""However, it's crucial that we take action to protect our marine resources and ensure they can continue to support our economy in the future."" The proposed regulations could include limits on the number of pots that can be deployed, as well as restrictions on the size and age of crabs and lobsters that can be caught. Some fishermen fear that such measures could significantly impact their livelihoods, particularly in the current economic climate. ""I've been struggling to make ends meet as it is,"" said Gwyneth Thomas, a lobster fisherman from Tenby. ""If they bring in more restrictions, I don't know how I'll be able to continue. I've got a family to feed and a mortgage to pay."" Others argue that the real issue is not overfishing, but rather the decline in stocks due to factors such as climate change, pollution, and bycatch from other fishing methods. They believe that a more holistic approach is needed to address these issues and ensure the long-term health of the marine ecosystem. ""We need to look at the bigger picture and address the root causes of the problem,"" said Ifan Thomas, a marine biologist based in Cardiff. ""That means investing in research, reducing bycatch, and addressing issues like climate change and pollution. We can't just keep putting band-aids on the problem."" As the consultation process continues, it remains to be seen what, if any, new regulations will be introduced. In the meantime, crab and lobster fishermen in Wales will continue to ply their trade, hoping that they can find a way to balance the needs of their industry with the needs of the marine environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
King Charles III: Outcry 'surprises' Prince William actor Oliver Chris,"BBC Two's King Charles III, which will be shown on Wednesday, imagines events after the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and it has ruffled feathers for some unexpected reasons. The controversial drama, penned by Mike Bartlett and directed by Tom Edmunds, has drawn criticism for its portrayal of Prince William, played by Oliver Chris. The outcry began when a clip from the drama was released, showing a heated argument between Prince William and his spouse, Kate Middleton, played by Bushra Anjum. In the scene, Prince William, who is depicted as the new monarch after his mother's passing, expresses his frustration about the burden of the throne and the expectations that come with it. The scene, however, did not sit well with some viewers, who believed it to be disrespectful towards the royal family, especially Prince William. The controversy escalated when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge issued a statement, expressing their disappointment with the programme's portrayal of private conversations, which they had not authorized. Oliver Chris, the actor who plays Prince William, has addressed the controversy in an interview with The Guardian. He acknowledged the sensitivity of the subject matter and expressed his surprise at the outcry, stating that the drama was meant to be a work of fiction that explored the implications of the Queen's death on the monarchy and the country at large. Chris further explained that he had met with the real Prince William and had conveyed his apologies for any misunderstanding or offense caused. He emphasized that the goal of the drama was not to defame or disparage the royal family but to engage audiences in a thought-provoking and timely debate about the role of the monarchy in modern-day Britain. The controversy surrounding King Charles III has raised questions about the boundaries of artistic freedom and the responsibility of broadcasters when it comes to depicting real-life figures in dramas. The conversation has also shed light on the delicate balance between the entertainment industry's creative license and the royal family's privacy. As the debate continues, it is crucial to remember that King Charles III is a work of fiction and not a documentary. It is an imaginative exploration of a hypothetical scenario that, while grounded in reality, should be viewed as a thought-provoking commentary on the implications of the monarchy and its role in today's world rather than an accurate portrayal of actual events or individuals. In conclusion, BBC Two's King Charles III has sparked controversy for its portrayal of Prince William, played by Oliver Chris. The drama, which depicts events after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, has been criticized for its fictionalized portrayal of private conversations between the royals.

Anonymous backs new encrypted social network site,"The site, Minds.com, has the same basic set-up as other social networks. Users post updates to followers, who can comment or share content. But unlike its competitors, Minds.com prides itself on providing an added layer of security through encryption. This feature has attracted the attention of Anonymous, the hacktivist collective known for their advocacy of internet freedom and anonymity. Anonymous announced their support for Minds.com in a statement released on their official website. They cited the site's commitment to user privacy and its use of encryption as reasons for their endorsement. Anonymous explained that as the world becomes increasingly digitized, the need for secure communication platforms grows. They argued that social media companies, who collect vast amounts of personal data from their users, have a duty to protect that information from prying eyes. Minds.com's use of encryption ensures that all communication on the site is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that only the sender and the intended recipient can read the messages. This is in contrast to many other social media platforms, which do not encrypt messages by default or only encrypt them while in transit. The site also allows users to remain anonymous if they choose to, adding an extra layer of security. Anonymous' endorsement of Minds.com is a significant development for the site. The hacktivist collective has a large and influential following, with millions of members around the world. Their support is likely to bring attention to Minds.com and potentially attract new users. However, Minds.com's focus on encryption and user privacy is not without its challenges. The site must balance the need for security with the need to comply with various laws and regulations. In some countries, encryption is seen as a tool used by criminals to hide illegal activity. Minds.com may face scrutiny from law enforcement agencies and governments, particularly as its user base grows. Despite these challenges, Minds.com remains committed to its mission of providing a secure and private social media platform. The site's creators see encryption as a necessary tool to protect user privacy and ensure that the internet remains a place where people can communicate freely and without fear of surveillance. With Anonymous' backing, Minds.com is well-positioned to make a significant impact on the social media landscape. In the coming weeks and months, it will be interesting to see how Minds.com grows and evolves. Will it be able to attract a large and diverse user base while maintaining its commitment to privacy and security? Only time will tell.

Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June,"The property purchase tax, commonly known as stamp duty, has been suspended on the first Â£500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July 2020. This significant measure, introduced by the UK government to boost the property market amidst the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, has allowed thousands of homebuyers to save substantial amounts of money. Today, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, announced that this tax break will now continue until the end of June 2021. This extension of the stamp duty holiday comes as a welcome relief for many homebuyers who were facing the pressure of completing their purchases before the original deadline of 30 June 2021. With the extension, buyers now have an additional four months to complete their transactions and take advantage of the tax break. The stamp duty holiday was initially due to end in March 2021, but the Chancellor announced an extension to the end of June in his recent Budget speech. This extension is expected to help support the property market further, as well as provide a much-needed boost to the economy as a whole. Under the current rules, stamp duty is payable on any portion of a property sale price above Â£125,000 for residential properties in England and Northern Ireland. The tax is calculated at progressive rates, with the highest rate of 12% applying to any portion of the sale price above Â£1.5 million. The suspension of stamp duty on the first Â£500,000 of all sales has therefore provided substantial savings for homebuyers. The extension of the stamp duty holiday is expected to benefit both first-time buyers and those moving up the property ladder. According to recent data from the UK Land Registry, house prices have risen by an average of 7.5% since the introduction of the holiday, with some areas experiencing even greater increases. The extension of the tax break is therefore likely to encourage even more activity in the property market. The stamp duty holiday has been credited with helping to stimulate the property market in the midst of the pandemic. According to data from the UK's property portal, Rightmove, the number of property transactions in the UK reached a record high in December 2020, with over 163,000 transactions completed in the month. The Chancellor's decision to extend the stamp duty holiday is part of a wider package of measures aimed at supporting the UK economy as it continues to recover from the pandemic. Other measures announced in the Budget include an increase in the National Living Wage, a continuation of the furlough scheme, and a new mortgage guarantee scheme designed to help first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. In conclusion, the extension of the stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland is good news for homebuyers and the property market as a",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Supreme Court: Trump to name nominee on 9 July,"He told reporters on board the presidential aircraft Air Force One that he had narrowed down his choices for the next Supreme Court justice to ""about five"" candidates. The vacancy arose when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement on June 27, leaving a vacancy on the nine-member bench. Trump's decision is being closely watched, as the next justice could have a significant impact on the court's direction for years to come. Kennedy was often considered a swing vote, and his retirement could tip the balance of power towards the court's conservative or liberal wing. Trump's list of potential nominees includes two women, both of whom have strong credentials and conservative records. One of them is Amy Coney Barrett, a federal appeals court judge and former law professor at Notre Dame. She is a devout Catholic and has been criticized by some for her religious beliefs. The other woman on Trump's list is Barbara Lagoa, a judge on the Florida Supreme Court. She was the first Hispanic woman to join that court and is known for her conservative rulings. The other candidates on Trump's list are all men. They include Thomas Hardiman, a federal appeals court judge and former worker at a steel mill; Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge and former White House staffer under President George W. Bush; and Raymond Kethledge, a federal appeals court judge and former law clerk for Kennedy. Trump has not yet revealed which of these candidates he will choose, but he has hinted that he will make his announcement on Monday, July 9. The White House has scheduled a prime-time announcement for 9 p.m. ET. The confirmation process for the nominee is expected to be contentious. Democrats have already pledged to oppose any nominee who they believe could threaten the Affordable Care Act or women's reproductive rights. Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to confirm a new justice before the midterm elections in November. The nominee will need to be confirmed by a simple majority vote in the Senate, which currently has a 51-49 Republican majority. If all Republicans vote in favor of the nominee, they will need at least one Democratic vote to reach the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. However, some Democrats up for reelection in red states may face pressure to support the nominee to avoid backlash from conservative voters. The Supreme Court has been a contentious issue throughout Trump's presidency. He has already appointed Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh to the court, and many believe that a third conservative justice could give the court a solid conservative majority for decades to come. Democrats, meanwhile, are fearful that the court could roll back key progressive policies and undermine the Affordable Care Act and women's reproductive rights.

Southeastern customers face worsening services,"If you thought your commute was bad now, brace yourselves, as the next five years are set to bring even more woes for Southeastern rail customers, according to a chilling assessment hidden away in an official Network Rail document. Tom Edwards, Transport Correspondent, London @BBCTomEdwards The document, obtained by BBC, reveals that the already overcrowded trains on the Southeastern network will only become more congested, with passenger numbers projected to rise by 13% by 2026. This comes despite the fact that the number of seats available on these trains has remained static. Passengers have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with the current state of Southeastern services, with overcrowding, cancellations, and delays being common complaints. Yet, the document suggests that little will change in the coming years, with Network Rail admitting that ""significant improvements"" to the network will not be delivered until after 2026. The document also highlights the issue of ageing infrastructure. It states that many of the tracks and signalling systems on the network are nearing the end of their operational life and require replacement. However, with no immediate plans to invest in upgrades, passengers can expect to continue dealing with the consequences, including delays and cancellations. Moreover, the document reveals that there will be no additional investment in new rolling stock for the network in the next five years. This means that the current fleet of trains, which are more than three decades old in some cases, will remain in use, despite their age and the resulting maintenance issues. Passengers are not the only ones voicing their concerns. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) has called on the government to take action to address the issues facing Southeastern rail customers. General Secretary Mick Lynch said: ""The Southeastern franchise is in crisis and it's the passengers who are paying the price. The current situation is unacceptable and the government must take immediate action to provide the necessary resources to improve services and invest in much-needed upgrades to the network."" The Department for Transport has defended its handling of the situation, stating that it has taken steps to improve services on the network, including the introduction of new trains and the expansion of services on some lines. However, the document suggests that these measures are unlikely to make a significant dent in the long-term issues facing Southeastern rail customers. As the commuter crowds push their way onto overcrowded trains each morning, the prospect of little relief in sight is a sobering one. For Southeastern rail customers, the next five years are set to be a period of continued struggle, as the official Network Rail document reveals the harsh reality of what lies ahead.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
RHI inquiry: Call for review of special adviser role,"By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter David Sterling's witness statements to the Renewable Heat Inquiry (RHI) were published on Wednesday. He is the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant in the region, and his role in the RHI scandal has come under intense scrutiny. Sterling's statements reveal that he was informed about the potential for significant financial risk in the RHI scheme as early as 2011. However, he did not take action to halt the scheme, citing a lack of legal powers and the need for political direction. The statements also reveal that Sterling was aware of the potential for 'game changing' applications in the RHI, which could lead to substantial financial gains for participants. Yet, he did not seek to intervene or impose restrictions on the scheme. The RHI inquiry, chaired by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, is examining the botched renewable energy scheme which cost the Northern Ireland public purse over Â£490m. The inquiry is looking into the role of politicians, civil servants, and other stakeholders in the debacle. Sterling's evidence has fueled calls for a review of the special adviser system in Northern Ireland, which allows political appointees to work within government departments, advising and influencing policy. The system has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. Sterling's statements confirm that he met with special advisers in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on several occasions to discuss the RHI scheme. However, he denies any impropriety and states that the meetings were in his capacity as a line manager, not as a participant in the policy process. But the revelations have prompted renewed calls for reform of the special adviser system. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said, ""The special adviser system needs an overhaul. We need to have a much clearer understanding of their role, their responsibilities, and their accountability."" The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, have defended the special adviser system, arguing that it is an essential part of the devolved government structure. However, they have also committed to reviewing the system in light of the RHI scandal. The RHI inquiry is expected to publish its final report in the coming months, and the findings are likely to have significant implications for the political landscape in Northern Ireland. The debate over the role of special advisers is just one of the many issues that will be addressed in the report. In the meantime, the publication of David Sterling's witness statements has added to the growing sense of disillusionment with the political establishment in Northern Ireland.

Video 'shows hunt law breached',"By David Miller, BBC Scotland environment correspondent Campaigners claim the ban on hunting with dogs is routinely being flouted in Scotland, with a new undercover video revealing apparent breaches of the law. The League Against Cruel Sports (LACS) said the footage, filmed over several months, shows hunts using dogs to chase and kill foxes, in defiance of the Hunting Act 2004. Hunt supporters insist they are following traditional practices and maintaining the integrity of the countryside, while observing all relevant laws. However, the LACS argues that the use of dogs to chase and kill wild mammals is an outdated and cruel practice, which has no place in modern society. The latest video, which was filmed across various locations in Scotland, includes footage of hounds being released to chase a fox, with some members of the hunt reportedly encouraging the dogs and urging them on. In another instance, hounds are seen tearing apart a fox, which had been pursuited and cornered by the dogs. The Hunting Act 2004 prohibits the hunting of wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales, and in Scotland, where the law is different, it is illegal to use dogs to deliberately chase and kill a fox, mink, or other wild mammal. However, hunting with hounds is still allowed in Scotland, provided that the hounds are kept under effective control and do not deliberately chase and kill the mammal. The LACS has reported the incidents to Police Scotland, and the force has confirmed that officers are reviewing the footage. In a statement, the LACS said: ""It is clear that the Hunting Act is being breached, and we will not stand idly by while animals suffer. We are calling on the police to take action and bring those responsible to justice."" Hunt supporters have defended the practice, stating that they are adhering to the law and maintaining the traditions of rural Scotland. The Scottish Countryside Alliance, which represents the interests of country sports enthusiasts, said it was essential that any allegations of illegal hunting were fully investigated, but added that the vast majority of hunts in Scotland were law-abiding. ""We are committed to upholding the highest standards of animal welfare and all members of the hunting community are expected to adhere to the law,"" a spokesperson for the Scottish Countryside Alliance said. ""However, we also recognise the need for the police and other authorities to take a proportionate and evidence-based approach to any investigations."" The issue of hunting with dogs is a contentious one, with strong opinions on both sides. While some argue that it is a traditional rural practice and an essential part of the countryside, others see it as an outdated and cruel practice that has no place in modern society.

Coronavirus: Welsh arts organisations 'losing Â£1.4m a week',"Nick Capaldi, the chief executive of the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, warned the Senedd's culture committee that the institution could lose Â£20m over the current financial year due to the coronavirus pandemic. This startling figure represents just one organisation in a wider landscape of Welsh arts organisations that are facing significant financial losses. Capaldi explained that the Centre, which is home to the Wales National Opera and the Welsh National Orchestra, amongst other cultural institutions, has been losing around Â£1.4m per week since lockdown measures were introduced in March. This loss is a result of cancelled performances, closed shops, and the inability to host events or welcome visitors. The situation is not unique to the Wales Millennium Centre. Across Wales, arts organisations are grappling with the financial repercussions of the pandemic. In Swansea, the National Waterfront Museum has seen attendance figures plummet, while theatres in Wrexham and Llandudno have been forced to close their doors indefinitely. The Arts Council of Wales has launched a Â£3m emergency fund to help support the sector during this time, but many organisations argue that this is only a drop in the ocean. The National Theatre Wales, for example, has seen its revenue decrease by Â£2m, while its operational costs continue to mount. The impact of the pandemic on the arts sector is not just financial. The loss of cultural experiences, the absence of communal gatherings, and the closure of spaces that bring people together are all profoundly felt. The arts have the power to inspire, to educate, and to heal, and their absence is palpable. The Welsh Government has acknowledged the importance of the arts sector and has pledged to support it through this crisis. Economy Minister, Ken Skates, has announced a Â£50m fund to help businesses and charities affected by the pandemic, with a significant portion of this intended for the arts sector. However, many in the sector argue that more needs to be done to ensure their survival. As the pandemic continues to unfold, the future of the Welsh arts sector remains uncertain. The loss of revenue, the closure of venues, and the absence of audiences are just a few of the challenges that lie ahead. But the resilience and creativity of the arts community in Wales remains undeterred. They continue to find new ways to connect with their audiences, to bring joy and inspiration, and to keep the cultural heart of Wales beating. Despite the challenges, Nick Capaldi remains optimistic. ""We will get through this,"" he told the Senedd's culture committee. ""We will find a way."" And as the arts community in Wales looks to the future, they too remain hopeful, determined to weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Theresa May 'not considering election' on walking break, says No 10","But hold your horses, everyone. I've just received word from Number 10 that contrary to speculation, Prime Minister Theresa May is not contemplating calling a snap election at this time. It's important to clarify this, considering Mrs. May's previous decision to unexpectedly announce an election while on a walking holiday in Snowdonia back in 2017. The current political climate in the United Kingdom is fraught with uncertainty, with Brexit negotiations ongoing and the issue of Northern Ireland's post-Brexit status still unresolved. Add to that the recent resignation of several senior Conservative Party members, and the rumors of an imminent election have been swirling. However, a Number 10 spokesperson has categorically denied that the prime minister is considering an election at this stage. ""The prime minister is focused on delivering on the priorities of the British people: getting Brexit done, fixing the economy, and tackling crime,"" the spokesperson stated. Despite the denial, some political commentators are skeptical. They argue that the prime minister could use an election as a way to bolster her mandate and silence her critics within her own party. Others believe that an election could provide an opportunity to capitalize on the current political instability in the Labour Party. But it's essential to remember that calling an election is a complex process. The prime minister would need to seek the approval of the Queen, dissolve Parliament, and set a date for the vote. With so many moving parts, it's not a decision that can be made lightly. In any case, the focus for now remains on the ongoing Brexit negotiations. The prime minister and her team are working tirelessly to secure a deal that can be accepted by both the EU and the UK Parliament. The stakes are high, and the pressure is on. So, while the prospect of an election may be an intriguing distraction for some, the reality is that the prime minister and her government have more pressing matters to attend to. And for now, that's where the focus lies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Endangered species: Gunshot detection technology deployed,"By Cristina Criddle, Technology reporter New technology has been developed by international conservation charity the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Google Cloud to help detect gunshots that threaten endangered species. The system, which uses machine learning and acoustic analysis, is being trialed in Africa to protect elephants and other animals from poaching. The technology, called the ""Gunshot Detection System,"" was developed in response to the increasing threat of poaching to endangered species, particularly elephants and rhinoceroses. Poachers often use guns to kill these animals for their ivory tusks and horns, which are highly valued in the black market. The system works by using microphones placed in the environment to record sounds. The recordings are then analyzed in real-time using machine learning algorithms to identify the distinctive acoustic signature of a gunshot. The system can distinguish between gunshots and other sounds, such as animal calls or natural noises. Once a gunshot is detected, the system sends an alert to rangers or park officials, allowing them to respond quickly to the threat. The technology can also provide location data, allowing responders to pinpoint the exact location of the poaching incident. The system was developed in collaboration between ZSL and Google's Digital Impact team, which provides technology solutions to non-profit organizations. The team used Google Cloud Platform to process the data and analyze the sounds. ""This technology is a game-changer for conservation efforts,"" said Dr. Samuel Wasser, Professor of Conservation Biology at the University of Washington and a collaborator on the project. ""It will help us respond more quickly and effectively to poaching incidents, which is crucial for saving endangered species."" The system is currently being trialed in several African parks, including the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. The trials are being conducted in partnership with park authorities and conservation organizations. The system has already proven effective in detecting gunshots, with several incidents being reported to rangers within minutes of the shots being fired. The system is expected to be fully operational in the coming months, providing real-time alerts to poaching incidents and helping to save endangered species from the threat of poaching. The development of the Gunshot Detection System is just one of the many ways that technology is being used to help protect endangered species. Other technologies, such as drones, satellite imagery, and radio collars, are also being used to monitor wildlife populations and respond to threats in real-time. As the demand for ivory and rhino horn continues to grow, the need for effective conservation technologies becomes even more urgent. The Gunshot Detection System is a promising solution to this problem, and it is expected to make a significant impact in the fight against poaching and the protection of endangered species.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Coronavirus: Paris restrictions to stay as France reopens,"Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, acknowledged the profound divide in the country regarding the rate of coronavirus infections as he announced that restrictions would continue in Paris and the north-eastern regions, despite the gradual reopening of the economy and schools in other parts of France. Philippe made the announcement during a press conference, stating that ""the virus is not evenly distributed across the country."" He added that ""the situation in the north-east and in Paris remains particularly challenging,"" as both regions have been hit hard by the second wave of infections. The prime minister's decision comes as France prepares to ease restrictions in most of the country starting on November 2, allowing bars and restaurants to reopen and schools to welcome students back to class. However, in Paris and the north-eastern regions, where the virus is still spreading rapidly, stricter measures will remain in place. In Paris, a curfew will be imposed from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., and gatherings of more than six people will be banned in private homes. Businesses such as bars, restaurants, and cultural venues will remain closed, except for takeaway and delivery services. Schools in the capital will also remain closed until November 15. Similar restrictions will be in place in the north-eastern regions of Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis, and Val-de-Marne, which have some of the highest infection rates in the country. Philippe acknowledged that the decision to maintain restrictions in certain regions while easing them in others would be controversial. ""I understand the frustration and the desire for fairness, but we must be clear-headed and responsible,"" he said. ""Each region will be judged on its own merit, and we will adapt the measures accordingly."" The prime minister also urged the French public to remain vigilant and to follow health guidelines to help curb the spread of the virus. ""We are all in this together, and we all have a role to play,"" he said. ""Let us not forget that the situation can change rapidly, and that the sacrifices we make today will help us protect our loved ones and our communities in the future."" France has reported over one million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 41,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily new cases has been steadily increasing in recent weeks, with over 30,000 new cases reported on October 25, the highest daily total since the start of the crisis. Despite the challenges, Philippe expressed confidence that France would eventually overcome the crisis. ""We have faced adversity before, and we have always come out stronger,"" he said. ""This time will be no different. We will get through this together, and we will emerge from it with renewed determination and resilience.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
RBS chief hopes to make Ulster Bank decision by end of summer,"By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor Ross McEwen, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), has indicated that a decision on the future of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland could be made by the end of summer. Speaking at the annual general meeting of RBS in Edinburgh, McEwen said ""all options"" were still being considered for what he described as a ""complex situation."" McEwen's comments come following months of speculation regarding the future of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland, with reports suggesting that the bank could be sold or closed due to the high cost of operating in the region. However, McEwen stressed that no definitive decision had been made and that the bank was continuing to serve its customers in Northern Ireland. He added that the bank was making progress in reducing its non-performing loans (NPLs) in Northern Ireland and that it was working with the Northern Ireland Executive to address the issue of legacy debt. McEwen also confirmed that the bank was continuing to invest in technology to improve its digital offering and to make banking more convenient for customers. The Ulster Bank crisis has been a source of concern for the Northern Ireland Executive, with Finance Minister Conor Murphy previously stating that the potential closure of the bank would have ""severe and far-reaching consequences"" for the local economy. Murphy has called on RBS to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Executive and to provide clarity on its plans for Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland. In response to these concerns, McEwen reiterated RBS's commitment to Northern Ireland and its customers. ""Ulster Bank is an important part of the Northern Ireland economy and we recognize the role we play in the lives of our customers,"" he said. ""We remain committed to finding a sustainable solution to the challenges we face in Northern Ireland and we will continue to engage with all stakeholders as we work towards that goal."" McEwen's comments were welcomed by the Northern Ireland Executive, with a spokesperson stating that the Executive was ""encouraged"" by the CEO's commitment to finding a ""sustainable solution"" for Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland. However, thespokesperson also reiterated the need for RBS to provide ""clarity and certainty"" for customers and stakeholders in the region. As the situation regarding Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland continues to evolve, the coming months are expected to bring further developments in the saga. With McEwen indicating a decision could be made by the end of summer, the focus now shifts to the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, which has the power to approve any sale or closure of the bank. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the future of Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland remains a matter of significant importance for both the bank and the local economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Can Clegg's European strategy revive Lib Dem fortunes?,"By Chris MasonPolitical correspondent, BBC News But Mr Clegg need not worry. It's one of several portraits hanging on the wall and depicts Alderman James N. Paxman, the Mayor of Colchester and a prominent Lib Dem figure from the past. The room, in the party's headquarters in London, is filled with such reminders of the Liberal Democrats' rich history. As Nick Clegg prepares for his annual conference speech, he'll be acutely aware that his European strategy could well be the making or breaking of his leadership. The party's fortunes have been in the doldrums since the coalition years, and many feel that a clear and compelling European vision could be the tonic they need. Mr Clegg's strategy is multifaceted. He wants to reassert the Lib Dems as a pro-European party, arguing that the EU is the best guarantee of peace, stability, and prosperity for the UK and its European neighbours. He'll emphasise the need for greater integration, not just in economic and trade matters, but in areas like foreign and security policy. The Lib Dems have long been champions of European cooperation, but their coalition partnership with the Conservative Party saw them forced to accept a referendum on EU membership. With Brexit now a reality, Mr Clegg sees an opportunity to reclaim the Lib Dems' European identity. But it won't be easy. Many in the party are still smarting from the coalition experience, while others are disillusioned by the perceived lack of progress on European issues since the referendum. Mr Clegg will need to persuade sceptics that his strategy is more than just words. He'll argue that the Lib Dems can offer something unique to the Brexit debate. While the Conservatives and Labour are locked in a seemingly endless game of brinkmanship, the Lib Dems can present themselves as the pragmatic, pro-European alternative. Mr Clegg has already ruled out a second referendum, but he'll emphasise the need for a People's Vote on the final deal, giving the public a say on the terms of Brexit. Mr Clegg's European strategy could well revive Lib Dem fortunes, but it won't be an easy sell. He'll need to address the party's internal divisions, build alliances with like-minded European parties, and convince the public that the Lib Dems are the best choice for those who want a close relationship with Europe. As he stands before his party conference, Mr Clegg will know that the eyes of the European political establishment, and the British public, will be on him. The stakes are high, but if he can deliver a compelling and convincing European vision, he could well restore the Lib Dems to their rightful place as a major force in British politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pakistan Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah targeted by US strike in Afghanistan,"Fazlullah, a notorious militant leader, rose to prominence as the head of the Pakistani Taliban in 2013, following the death of Hakimullah Mehsud. His tenure was marked by a series of brutal attacks against civilians and security forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan. One of the most heinous crimes attributed to Fazlullah was the shooting of Malala Yousafzai, a young Pakistani activist for girls' education, in October 2012. Fazlullah's men targeted Malala as she was on her way home from school. The attack left her critically injured, but she survived and went on to become a global advocate for education and women's rights. Another horrific attack on Fazlullah's watch was the massacre at the Army Public School in Peshawar on December 16, 2014. Gunmen stormed the school, taking hostages and killing more than 130 students and 13 adult staff members. The attack was a devastating blow to Pakistan's civilian population, who had hoped that the country was turning a corner in its long-running struggle against terrorism. Fazlullah's brutal tactics and anti-Western ideology made him a prime target for international forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was believed to have been hiding in the border regions between the two countries, where the Taliban and other militant groups have long found refuge. On June 13, 2018, US forces conducted a drone strike in Afghanistan's Kunar province, targeting a compound believed to be where Fazlullah was hiding. According to US officials, Fazlullah was killed in the strike, along with three other militants. The news was met with relief by many in Pakistan and Afghanistan, who had suffered from Fazlullah's violent reign of terror. However, the death of Fazlullah does not mark the end of militancy in the region. The Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups continue to pose a threat to stability in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The challenge for both governments and international actors will be to address the underlying causes of militancy, including poverty, lack of education, and political instability, while also taking decisive action against those who seek to use violence to achieve their goals. The legacy of Fazlullah's violent leadership serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of militancy and the urgent need for a comprehensive and sustainable response from all stakeholders. Malala Yousafzai's inspiring story of resilience and determination in the face of adversity offers a glimmer of hope for a better future, one where education and human rights are valued and protected.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New Aberdeen FC stadium could be derailed even if approved,"By Rebecca Curran, BBC Scotland reporter The stadium and training facilities, which are a key part of Aberdeen Football Club's (AFC) plans for future growth, could be derailed even if approved by Aberdeen City councillors. This is due to ongoing concerns over the potential impact on traffic and infrastructure in the area. The proposed development at Kingsford, near Westhill, includes a 20,000-seater stadium, a 4,000-capacity training ground, and a hotel. AFC's chief executive, Duncan Fraser, has emphasised the economic benefits of the project, estimating it will create around 1,500 jobs and contribute Â£120m to the local economy over ten years. However, opposition from local residents and councillors, as well as uncertainty over funding, could yet scupper the plans. The Scottish Government has pledged Â£50m towards the project, but the remaining Â£100m is yet to be secured. Councillor Jenny Laing, the leader of Aberdeen City Council, has previously stated that the council would not support the development without ""clear evidence"" of the funding being in place. AFC has expressed confidence that the remaining funds will be secured, but no firm commitments have been made. Local residents have raised concerns over the potential impact on traffic, particularly during match days, and the strain on local infrastructure such as schools and hospitals. The Kingsford community council has called for a traffic impact assessment to be carried out before any decision is made. Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt has also raised concerns over the potential impact on local infrastructure and urged the council to take a ""thorough and considered approach"" to the plans. Councillor Laing has acknowledged the concerns and emphasised the importance of engaging with the community. She has also confirmed that the council's planning committee will make the final decision on the development, but the timeline for this is unclear. AFC's chief executive, Duncan Fraser, has reiterated the club's commitment to engaging with the community and addressing concerns. He has also emphasised the importance of the development for the future of the club and the local economy. The potential impact on traffic and infrastructure, as well as the uncertainty over funding, are the main obstacles standing in the way of the development. If these issues can be addressed, Aberdeen FC's plans for a new stadium and training facilities could yet come to fruition. However, if not, the project could be derailed, leaving the club and the local community in limbo.

Birstall house explosion 'caused by broken pipework',"The blast that destroyed Janet Jasper's home in Birstall, Leicestershire, and the neighbouring house on 11 December 2017, was later identified as being caused by a broken gas pipe. The house with the gas leak in Allington Drive was empty at the time as the owner was away on business. The incident occurred around midday when residents reported hearing a loud explosion. Neighbours described the scene as one of chaos and destruction, with debris and rubble scattered throughout the streets. Emergency services arrived at the scene shortly after the explosion, with fire crews working to contain the gas leak and prevent any further damage. Investigations into the cause of the explosion began immediately, with gas company engineers conducting a thorough inspection of the area's gas network. It was discovered that a section of pipework had broken, leading to a gas leak that had gone undetected until the explosion. The broken pipe was located in a section of the gas network that had not been inspected for several years. The gas company expressed their deepest sympathies to those affected by the explosion and pledged to conduct a full review of their inspection and maintenance procedures. Janet Jasper and her neighbour, who was in the adjacent property at the time of the explosion, were both fortunate to escape unharmed. However, they were left to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, which included being displaced from their homes and dealing with the emotional trauma of the incident. The local community rallied around the affected families, with neighbours offering support and assistance in any way they could. A local charity set up a fund to help those affected by the explosion, with donations pouring in from all over the country. The incident highlighted the importance of regular gas pipe inspections and maintenance, not just for the safety of individuals and their properties, but also for the wider community. Gas companies and local authorities have since stepped up their efforts to ensure that all gas networks are regularly inspected and maintained to prevent any similar incidents from occurring in the future. Janet Jasper and her neighbour were left to reflect on the events of that fateful day, grateful for their good fortune in escaping harm but also aware of the devastating impact that a simple gas leak could have. The incident served as a stark reminder of the importance of safety and maintenance, and the potential consequences of neglect.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Canada's immigration website crashes during US vote,"Officials at Canada's immigration department have confirmed that their website experienced technical difficulties on the night of the US presidential election, with some users reporting that the site had crashed entirely. The cause, according to a spokesperson, was a higher than normal level of traffic. It has been suggested that this sudden surge in activity may have been caused by US citizens exploring their options for moving to Canada in the aftermath of the election results. In the hours following the announcement of Joe Biden's victory, the hashtag #MoveToCanada began trending on social media, with many Americans expressing their disappointment with the outcome and their intention to start a new life north of the border. Although the exact number of visitors to the Canadian immigration website on election night is not yet known, it is clear that there was a significant increase in activity compared to previous days. The website, which is usually used by prospective immigrants to fill out forms and apply for visas, was unable to handle the volume of traffic, leading to errors and crashes for some users. The Canadian immigration department has apologized for any inconvenience caused and has assured users that they will do their best to process applications as quickly as possible. They have also urged anyone who was unable to complete their application on the night of the election to try again at a later time. This is not the first time that the Canadian immigration website has experienced technical difficulties due to high levels of traffic. In 2016, during the height of the US presidential campaign, the site saw a similar surge in activity, with many Americans expressing their desire to move to Canada if their preferred candidate lost the election. At the time, the department blamed the issues on a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, although it is now believed that the real cause was simply the high volume of traffic. The trend of US citizens considering moving to Canada in response to political events is not a new one. In the past, there have been similar spikes in interest following contentious elections, as well as during times of political instability or economic uncertainty. While it is not clear how many people will actually follow through with their plans to move, the fact that Canada continues to be seen as a desirable destination for those seeking a fresh start is a testament to its reputation as a welcoming and inclusive country. Regardless of the motivations behind the sudden surge in interest, one thing is clear: the Canadian immigration website will need to be prepared to handle high levels of traffic in the future. Whether it is due to political events, economic conditions, or other factors, the department will need to invest in infrastructure and technology to ensure that their online services are able to meet the demands of users. Only then will they be able to continue to provide a positive experience for those seeking to make Canada their home.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Grave of 'George III's granddaughter' restored in Carmarthen,"Experts say that Caroline Prytherch and her sister, Anne, were not only sisters but also relatives of King George III of England through an intriguing connection. This link stems from the former king's time as the Prince of Wales, during which he had a relationship with Hannah Lightfoot. Hannah was the mother of Thomas Lightfoot, who went on to marry Caroline's mother, Mary. The previously lost family grave of Ms Prytherch, situated in the picturesque St. Peter's Churchyard in Carmarthen, South Wales, has been painstakingly restored thanks to the dedication of local historian and archaeologist, Mr. Ieuan Rees. Mr. Rees, who has spent years researching the history of the town and its people, came across references to the Prytherch sisters in old records. Despite numerous visits to the churchyard, the grave had remained elusive. However, his perseverance paid off when he discovered it hidden beneath a pile of earth and weeds. The grave, which dates back to the late 18th century, is a modest slate tomb with a simple inscription that reads: ""Sacred to the memory of Caroline Prytherch, who departed this life on the 9th day of October, 1793, aged 37 years. Also Anne Prytherch, who died on the 21st day of March, 1792, aged 31 years."" Mr. Rees, who has documented the discovery in an upcoming issue of the South Wales History Society's journal, says that the restoration of the grave is significant for several reasons. ""Firstly, it sheds light on an often-overlooked chapter of Welsh history, which is the connection between the royal family and the people of Carmarthen,"" he explains. ""Secondly, it highlights the importance of local history and the role of dedicated individuals in preserving our heritage."" The restoration of the grave was made possible through a grant from the Carmarthenshire Heritage Trust, as well as donations from local residents and businesses. The work involved clearing the grave of debris, repairing the slate, and replacing the worn-out inscription. The discovery and restoration of the Prytherch sisters' grave have also sparked renewed interest in the history of St. Peter's Church, which dates back to the 13th century. The church, which is currently undergoing a major restoration project, is home to numerous historical artifacts, including a 15th-century wooden effigy of a knight and a collection of medieval tiles. As Mr. Rees looks towards the future, he hopes that the restoration of the Prytherch sisters' grave will inspire others to delve deeper into the history of their own communities.

Solar subsidy 'to be protected',"By Bob Howard, Reporter, Money Box The feed-in tariff scheme, launched last April by the UK government, promised a typical household earnings of Â£800 per year by selling excess solar power back to the grid. However, the scheme, which was designed to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, has come under threat. The solar subsidy, which pays homeowners for every unit of electricity they generate and feed back into the grid, is set to be reduced from April 2019. The cuts, which were announced late last year, have sparked controversy and concern among solar panel owners and environmental campaigners. Under the new rules, homeowners with solar panels installed on their properties will receive less money for each unit of electricity they sell back to the grid. The reduction in subsidy payments, which are set to decrease by around 30% for new installations, has led to fears that the scheme may no longer be financially viable for many households. The National Solar Trade Association (STA) has warned that the cuts could lead to a significant slowdown in the solar industry. According to the STA, around 10,000 jobs could be at risk as a result of the subsidy reduction. The government has defended the cuts, stating that the scheme was intended to be a short-term measure to encourage the adoption of solar panels and that the industry is now established enough to stand on its own. However, critics argue that the cuts come at a time when the UK is facing a climate crisis and needs to be doing more to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. Solar panel owners have expressed their disappointment and frustration at the cuts. One homeowner, who asked to remain anonymous, told Money Box that they had installed solar panels on their home last year, expecting to recoup their investment through the feed-in tariff scheme. However, with the subsidy set to be significantly reduced, they are now facing the prospect of not making back their initial outlay. The government has also faced criticism from environmental groups, who argue that the cuts will make it harder for households to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change. According to Friends of the Earth, the cuts will result in around 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. Despite the controversy and uncertainty surrounding the solar subsidy cuts, there are still ways for homeowners to make the most of their solar panels. Many energy companies offer 'fixed tariffs', which allow homeowners to sell their excess electricity back to the grid at a guaranteed price. Additionally, some households are exploring the possibility of selling their excess electricity directly to neighbours or local businesses. In conclusion, the solar subsidy cuts have sparked controversy and concern among solar panel owners and environmental campaigners. With the industry facing significant job losses and the UK needing to do more to combat climate change, there is growing pressure on the government to reconsider its decision.

Great Yarmouth school sets up food bank to help families,"North Denes Primary School in Great Yarmouth has taken the initiative to set up a food bank within its premises to help families in need. Head teacher Debbie Whiting shared that she was moved to action when some children came to school hungry and ""too quiet,"" indicating their struggle to focus on their studies due to food insecurity. Speaking about the decision to start a food bank at the school, Whiting expressed her concern for the welfare of her students, stating, ""We wanted to make sure that no child goes hungry during term time. Hunger can make it difficult for children to concentrate, which can impact their learning and overall development."" The food bank, which was launched in collaboration with local food bank organisations, has already received a significant response from the school community. Parents, teachers, and even local businesses have generously donated food items, creating a steady supply to support families in need. Whiting explained the process for families to access the food bank, stating, ""Families can come and collect food parcels discreetly from the school office. We don't want anyone to feel embarrassed or ashamed. It's important that they know they're not alone and that we're here to help."" The idea of a school-based food bank is not a new concept, with similar initiatives being implemented in other parts of the country. However, the scale and reach of North Denes Primary's food bank have made it an exceptional example of community support. The school's proactive approach to addressing food insecurity within its student body has been met with praise from parents and the local community. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, shared, ""I'm just so grateful that the school is doing this. It's such a relief to know that my child will have enough to eat, even if things are tough for us at home."" The food bank is just one of the many ways North Denes Primary School is going the extra mile to support its students and their families. Whiting and her team are also working on providing additional resources and support, such as after-school clubs and holiday activities, to ensure that all children have access to opportunities for growth and development. In the face of increasing poverty and food insecurity, initiatives like North Denes Primary School's food bank are essential in ensuring that children can focus on their education and have the support they need to thrive. The school's commitment to its community and its students is truly commendable, and it serves as a reminder that we all have a role to play in creating a more equitable society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

During a recent press conference, he stated, ""My marriage is strong. Melania is a fantastic First Lady and an incredible woman. These rumors and stories are just that â rumors and stories."" Despite the ongoing media attention, the Trumps have continued to carry out their duties as the First Family with a sense of normalcy. Melania has focused her efforts on her initiatives as First Lady, most notably her ""Be Best"" campaign which aims to improve the lives of children. The President, meanwhile, has maintained a busy schedule both domestically and abroad. The constant speculation about their marriage, however, has not gone unnoticed by the Trumps. Melania expressed her frustration in the interview, ""It can be difficult at times, but I choose to focus on the positive and stay strong for my family."" The First Lady's words serve as a reminder that despite the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye, the Trumps remain committed to each other and to their roles as the leaders of the United States. Melania's resilience in the face of adversity is a testament to her strength and determination. She has chosen to rise above the rumors and speculation, focusing instead on her family and her work. In doing so, she has proven that she is not only a gracious and dedicated First Lady, but also a strong and independent woman. As the Trumps continue to navigate the complex world of politics, it is clear that they will do so with unwavering support for one another. Their love and commitment to each other, despite the constant scrutiny, serves as an inspiration to all of us. Whether the media chooses to focus on the positive or the negative, one thing remains clear â Melania and Donald Trump are a force to be reckoned with.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bet365: UK's best-paid boss sees pay rise to Â£265m,"The firm's accounts for the financial year ending March 2021 have revealed a significant increase in compensation for Bet365's ""highest paid director."" The figure, which amounts to Â£265m including dividends, represents a substantial rise of Â£48m compared to the previous year. This eye-catching remuneration package has once again placed Bet365's CEO, Denise Coates, at the top of the list for the UK's best-paid executives. Coates, who owns a majority stake in the company, has been instrumental in its growth into a global powerhouse in the online gambling industry. Bet365 reported revenues of Â£4.8bn for the year, up from Â£4.3bn the previous year, with profits reaching Â£1.1bn. Despite the impressive financial results, Coates' compensation package has raised eyebrows, particularly given the controversial nature of the gambling industry and the ongoing debate about the social and ethical implications of gambling. Coates' remuneration is determined by a complex formula that includes a fixed salary, a performance-related bonus, and dividends paid out from the company's profits. The CEO's base salary remains undisclosed, but it is believed to be relatively modest in comparison to the bonuses and dividends she receives. Bet365's financial success can be attributed to its innovative approach to online gambling, which has enabled it to capitalize on the growth of the digital market. The company's offering includes a vast range of sports betting, casino games, and poker, all available through its user-friendly website and mobile app. The controversy surrounding Coates' pay package is not new. In 2019, she received a compensation package worth Â£252m, making her the highest-paid executive in the UK for that year. Her pay has been a topic of much debate, with some arguing that it is excessive and out of touch with the average worker's wages. Others, however, defend her remuneration as a reflection of her remarkable business acumen and the company's financial success. In response to the criticism, Bet365 has stated that Coates' pay is determined by a formula that is transparent, fair, and in line with industry standards. The company has also emphasized its commitment to responsible gambling and its efforts to mitigate the potential harm caused by gambling. As the online gambling industry continues to grow, so too will the debate surrounding executive pay packages. With Bet365's financial results showing no signs of slowing down, it is likely that Coates' compensation will remain a topic of interest and controversy in the years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
India Kolkata flyover collapse: At least 20 dead,"In the chaotic aftermath of the Kolkata flyover collapse in India, the city was left reeling from the devastating consequences of the structural failure. More are feared trapped under the concrete and steel bridge, and rescue efforts are continuing all night in a desperate bid to save lives. The scene was one of chaos and despair, as emergency services worked tirelessly to extract survivors from the rubble. Images of the disaster site have been circulating on social media, showing the extent of the damage inflicted by the crumbling infrastructure. Residents, desperate to help, could be seen using their bare hands to search for victims amidst the debris. The scene was a stark reminder of the human cost of neglecting safety concerns. Safety issues such as lack of inspections and the use of substandard materials have long been a concern in India's infrastructure sector. The Kolkata flyover collapse is just the latest in a series of incidents that have raised questions about the government's commitment to ensuring the safety of its citizens. The flyover, which was built over two decades ago, had shown signs of deterioration in recent years. Cracks had appeared on the surface, and there had been reports of corrosion in the supports. Yet, despite these concerns, no action was taken to address the issues, leaving the bridge vulnerable to collapse. The Indian government has promised a thorough investigation into the causes of the disaster. However, many are calling for more urgent action to address the safety concerns in the country's infrastructure. The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, has offered its expertise to help in the investigation, and engineers from around the world are offering their assistance. The Kolkata flyover collapse has left a deep sense of sorrow and anger in its wake. The loss of life is a tragic reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in infrastructure projects. It is also a call to action, urging governments and authorities to take a proactive approach to addressing safety concerns before they lead to catastrophic consequences. As rescue efforts continue, the focus is on finding those still missing and providing support to the families of the victims. The city of Kolkata stands united in its grief, offering comfort and solidarity in these difficult times. The hope is that this tragedy will serve as a catalyst for change, leading to a renewed commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of all citizens. In the meantime, the search for survivors continues, as the city holds its breath, praying for a miraculous outcome. The resilience of the human spirit shines through in the face of adversity, as the people of Kolkata come together to support each other in their time of need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Unsolvable' exam question leaves Chinese students flummoxed,"Primary school students at a school in the Chinese district of Shunqing were faced with this question on a paper: ""If a ship had 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard, how old is the farmer who owns the livestock?"" This seemingly innocent question left many students and even their teachers baffled. The math part of the question was not difficult, as the students were able to calculate the total number of animals on the ship by adding the number of sheep and goats together. However, the second part of the question, which required determining the age of the farmer, proved to be an unsolvable riddle. The school's principal, Mr. Li, was taken aback when he received numerous inquiries from parents about the unconventional exam question. He immediately contacted the education bureau to report the issue and request clarification. However, the bureau only replied that the question was not an error and was intended to assess the students' problem-solving skills. Mr. Li then contacted other schools in the district to inquire if they had also included such a question on their exams. To his surprise, he learned that several schools had indeed given their students similar questions. Some of the questions were even more complex, such as ""If a train leaves Beijing at 6 am traveling west at 50 km/h and another train leaves Shanghai at 7 am traveling east at 60 km/h, at what point do the two trains meet?"" Many parents were outraged, arguing that such unconventional and unsolvable questions were unnecessary and added unnecessary stress to their children. They believed that the exams should focus on traditional math problems that could be easily solved with textbook knowledge. The education bureau defended its decision, stating that the questions were designed to challenge the students and encourage them to think creatively and critically. The bureau also emphasized that the exams were not intended to be the sole measure of a student's academic ability. Despite the controversy, some educators supported the unconventional exam questions. They believed that such questions could help students develop problem-solving skills and learn to approach complex problems in new and innovative ways. In the end, the school decided to continue administering the exams as intended, but with the understanding that they would not be the sole factor in determining a student's academic performance. The students were encouraged to work through the questions to the best of their ability and not become too discouraged if they were unable to find a solution. The unsolvable exam question may have left many Chinese students and teachers flummoxed, but it also sparked a larger conversation about the role of creativity and critical thinking in education. Ultimately, the question may have served as a reminder that learning is not just about memorizing facts and formulas, but also about tackling complex problems and developing the skills necessary to find innovative solutions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"New markets for Welsh firms after Brexit, says PM","The Conservative leader, Theresa May, addressed the Welsh business community in Cardiff on Tuesday, expressing her determination to secure new markets for Welsh firms post-Brexit. The Prime Minister was speaking at the annual conference of the Wales Chambers of Commerce, where she affirmed her commitment to ensuring a smooth transition for Welsh businesses as the UK leaves the European Union. Mrs May said, ""I want the best possible deal for Wales and for the whole of the UK. That means securing access to European markets for our goods and services, but it also means looking beyond the EU to new markets and new opportunities."" She emphasized the importance of forging new trade relationships with countries outside of the EU, particularly in Asia. The Prime Minister highlighted the success of the UK-Japan trade deal, which was ratified in October, as an example of what could be achieved through careful negotiation and diplomacy. She pledged to continue working to secure similar agreements with other countries, including China, India, and the United States. Mrs May also addressed concerns from Welsh businesses about the potential impact of Brexit on their workforce. She reassured them that the government was working to ensure a seamless transition for EU nationals currently living and working in the UK, and that businesses would be able to continue recruiting the talent they need. The Prime Minister acknowledged that the process of leaving the EU would not be without its challenges, but she expressed her confidence in the ability of Welsh firms to adapt and thrive in the new economic landscape. ""I know that Welsh businesses are resilient and innovative,"" she said. ""You have faced challenges before and you have always come out the other side stronger."" Mrs May also took the opportunity to highlight the government's plans to invest in infrastructure projects in Wales, including the M4 relief road and the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon. She said that these investments would create new opportunities for Welsh businesses and help to drive economic growth in the region. The Prime Minister's remarks were met with a positive response from the business community in Wales. Mike Davis, the director of the Wales Chambers of Commerce, praised the Prime Minister for her commitment to supporting Welsh businesses and her recognition of the importance of new markets. ""We welcome the Prime Minister's continued focus on securing new trade relationships and investment opportunities for Welsh businesses,"" he said. ""We will continue to work with the government to ensure that the voices of Welsh businesses are heard in the Brexit negotiations and beyond."" As the Prime Minister left the conference, she was asked about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Welsh businesses. She reiterated her belief that a deal was the best outcome for all parties, but she also emphasized the need for businesses to prepare for all eventualities. ""We are working to secure a deal, but we also need to ensure that businesses are ready for every scenario,"" she said. ""That",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
South Africa parliament chaos as Malema MPs heckle Zuma,"The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, caused chaos in the South African parliament as they repeatedly interrupted President Jacob Zuma during question time, demanding answers over a spending scandal. The speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, attempted to restore order, but her calls were ignored as EFF members continued to heckle and shout, causing disruption and delaying the proceedings. The largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), joined in the protest, with its members also calling for transparency and accountability regarding the scandal. The DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, accused Zuma of failing to lead the country and of being a ""president of the guilty."" The situation quickly escalated as EFF MPs refused to be removed from the chamber, leading to scuffles between them and parliament security personnel. Some EFF members were dragged out of the chamber, while others managed to evade security and remain inside, continuing their protests. The chaos in the parliament came after a week of protests and demonstrations outside the parliament buildings in Cape Town, where thousands of South Africans had gathered to call for Zuma's resignation. The scandal in question involves allegations of corruption and the misuse of state funds for upgrades to Zuma's private residence in Nkandla. Zuma, who has been under increasing pressure to step down, remained calm during the disruptions, answering questions as best he could amid the chaos. He denied any wrongdoing and accused the opposition of politicizing the issue. The EFF's actions were condemned by some as a breach of parliamentary decorum and a distraction from the important issues facing the country. However, many South Africans saw the protests as a legitimate expression of frustration and a call for accountability from their leaders. The incident also raised questions about the role of parliament in holding the executive accountable and the need for greater transparency and oversight in government spending. It remains to be seen how the ruling African National Congress (ANC) will respond to the growing calls for Zuma's resignation and whether this will lead to meaningful reforms or further instability in the country. Despite the chaos, the parliament proceedings eventually resumed, though with a sense of unease and uncertainty hanging over the chamber. The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing South Africa's democracy and the need for continued vigilance and engagement from all South Africans.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stolen dogs: Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry raids 'uncover 80',"In a significant development in the ongoing investigation into stolen dogs and puppies, Dyfed-Powys and South Wales (SWP) police forces have revealed that between 70 and 80 animals have been discovered during raids in Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry. The dogs and puppies, which are said to be worth tens of thousands of pounds, were found in various locations following a series of co-ordinated raids on Monday, February 7, 2022. The animals, mostly Pedigree English Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, were located in homes and kennels across the two areas. Detective Inspector Alun Thomas, of Dyfed-Powys Police, expressed his satisfaction with the progress made in the investigation, stating, ""This is a significant seizure and we are working closely with RSPCA inspectors to ensure the welfare of these animals. Our inquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone with information to come forward."" The raids are part of an ongoing investigation into the theft of valuable dogs and puppies, which has seen multiple reports across Wales and the south west of England over the past few months. Many of these thefts have been linked to organised crime groups, with some animals being sold on for substantial sums of money. The RSPCA has praised the efforts of the police forces and has offered its assistance in caring for the seized animals. RSPCA inspector Chris O'Sullivan said, ""We're very grateful to the police for their hard work in bringing these animals to safety. Our priority now is to ensure they receive the care and attention they need. We would urge anyone who is concerned about the welfare of an animal to contact the RSPCA's 24-hour emergency hotline on 0300 1234 999."" The news of the seizure has been welcomed by the public, many of whom have expressed their relief that the stolen animals have been recovered. However, concerns have been raised about the motives behind the thefts and the potential harm caused to the dogs. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""I'm just glad that these poor animals have been found and are safe now. But it's terrifying to think that they were being kept in such terrible conditions for no reason other than to make a profit. It's just heartbreaking."" The police forces have urged anyone with information about the thefts or the sale of stolen dogs and puppies to contact them. Anyone with information can contact Dyfed-Powys Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Government automatically enrols firms in case of no-deal Brexit,"The move by the UK government to automatically enrol firms in the EU's Transitional Simplified Procedures (TSP) scheme is aimed at ensuring a smooth transition for British businesses trading with the European Union after Brexit, in the event of a no-deal scenario. This announcement comes after growing concerns from business trade groups about the potential disruption to cross-border trade. Business trade groups had been pressing the government for clarity on how customs procedures would operate post-Brexit and the potential costs and administrative burdens that might be imposed on companies. The TSP scheme, which is being offered to UK businesses free of charge, is designed to simplify the customs process for goods moving between the UK and the EU, and is expected to be in place from the day the UK leaves the EU. Under the TSP scheme, companies will be able to make a single declaration for all their consignments in a month, rather than having to complete one declaration for each consignment, which will significantly reduce the administrative burden for businesses. The scheme will also enable businesses to defer paying their customs duties for up to six months, providing them with valuable cash flow support. The government has stated that businesses will be able to apply for the TSP scheme online, and that they will receive a unique reference number which they can use to make their declarations. The government has also confirmed that it will provide support and guidance to help businesses make the necessary preparations for using the TSP scheme. The announcement of the TSP scheme has been welcomed by business trade groups, who have long been calling for greater clarity and support from the government on customs procedures post-Brexit. However, they have warned that the scheme is only a temporary measure, and that businesses will still need to make significant investments in new technology and processes to be able to adapt to the new trading environment. The Freight Transport Association, which represents companies involved in the movement of goods by road, rail, sea and air, has stated that the TSP scheme is a ""step in the right direction,"" but that it is essential that businesses are given as much time as possible to prepare for the changes. ""The government must provide as much notice as possible and ensure that businesses have the resources they need to make the necessary preparations,"" said Christopher Snelling, the FTA's head of European Policy. The TSP scheme is just one of a number of measures that the government has announced to help businesses prepare for Brexit. Other measures include grants to help businesses invest in new technology, and the establishment of a customs intermediary service to help businesses navigate the new customs procedures. Despite these measures, however, there are still many uncertainties surrounding the impact of Brexit on businesses, and many companies are taking a cautious approach to their trading arrangements with the EU. Some have opted to stockpile goods or to move their operations to other EU countries in order to mitigate the risks of potential trade disruption.

Covid: Manchester pub closures 'won't stop infection rate rising',"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a three-tier system on Monday, and though yet to be confirmed, Manchester is expected to be put in tier three, with the highest level of restrictions. This means that pubs and bars in the area will be forced to close, except for takeaway and delivery services. However, health experts have warned that these closures may not be enough to stop the infection rate from rising in Manchester. Dr. Zoe Waxman, an epidemiologist at the University of Manchester, said, ""While closing pubs and bars is an important measure, it is not a silver bullet. The virus is spreading rapidly in Manchester, and we need to take a more holistic approach to controlling the outbreak."" According to the latest data, Manchester has the highest infection rate of any city in England, with over 500 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. The city's testing sites have been overwhelmed, with long queues and delays in getting results. The closure of pubs and bars is just one of several measures that Manchester City Council has implemented to try and control the outbreak. The council has also introduced stricter rules on social distancing and gatherings, and has increased its testing capacity. But some residents and business owners are questioning whether these measures will be enough. ""I understand the need for restrictions, but closing pubs and bars is not going to stop people from socializing,"" said Sarah Jones, a local resident. ""They'll just find other ways to meet up, and that could make it harder to control the spread of the virus."" The closure of pubs and bars is also a major blow for the hospitality industry in Manchester, which has already been hit hard by the pandemic. Many businesses are struggling to survive, and the prospect of further closures is causing anxiety and uncertainty. The government has promised to provide financial support to businesses affected by the new restrictions. But for many, the damage may already be done. ""We've been closed for months, and now we're facing the prospect of more closures,"" said John Smith, the owner of a local pub. ""I don't know how much longer we can hold on."" As the situation in Manchester continues to worsen, there are growing calls for more radical measures to be taken to control the outbreak. Some experts have suggested that the government should consider imposing a city-wide lockdown, or even a nationwide lockdown, to bring the virus under control. But such measures would come with significant economic and social costs, and there are concerns about the impact on mental health and wellbeing. For now, the focus is on implementing the existing measures as effectively as possible, and hoping that they will be enough to turn the tide in Manchester.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mosul Iraq battle: IS accused of shooting civilians,"The UN human rights office in Iraq reported on 11 November that 12 civilians were shot dead in the Bakir area of Mosul when they attempted to prevent IS militants from launching rockets from the rooftops of their homes. Furthermore, 27 civilians were allegedly killed by the militant group in retaliation for their intervention. These incidents are just the latest in a series of grave violations against civilians in Mosul as Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition continue their offensive to retake the city from IS control. According to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, ""Credible reports suggest that ISIL [another name for IS] have intentionally targeted civilians in the Bakir area, including women and children, in relation to their military operations."" The UN has documented numerous instances of IS using civilians as human shields, executing them as a form of punishment, and indiscriminately shelling residential areas. The fighting in Mosul has left an estimated 300,000 people displaced, facing dire living conditions in camps and makeshift shelters. ""The situation in Mosul is dire,"" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said. ""The conflict is taking a heavy toll on the civilian population, and we urge all parties to take every possible measure to protect civilians and minimize civilian casualties."" The US military has launched airstrikes in support of Iraqi forces during their operations in Mosul, but there have been instances where civilians have been unintentionally caught in the crossfire. The coalition has acknowledged these incidents and has expressed its regret. It is essential for all parties involved to take every precaution to minimize civilian harm. The battle for Mosul is the largest military operation in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003. The city, which was once Iraq's second-largest, fell under IS control in June 2014. The extremist group has used Mosul as its de facto capital, establishing a so-called Islamic caliphate that also includes parts of Syria. Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, began their offensive to retake Mosul in October 2016. The fight for the city is expected to be long and arduous, with IS putting up a fierce resistance. The battle for Mosul is a crucial step in the campaign to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria. The UN and human rights organizations are urging all parties involved to prioritize the protection of civilians. The UN Human Rights Office has called on Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition to take all possible measures to minimize civilian harm and ensure that any violations are investigated and those responsible are held accountable. As the battle for Mosul rages on, the lives and safety of civilians must not be overlooked. The international",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Male employees want flexible work too,"By Mary-Ann Russon, Business Reporter, BBC News In the past, pressure for the opportunity to work part-time or flexibly has usually come from women trying to juggle childcare and work. But four in ten men now say they would also like to work flexibly or part-time, according to a new study. The research, published by flexible working platform, Workgenius, showed that 42% of men surveyed would prefer to work flexibly or part-time, compared to just 37% of women. The shift in attitudes towards flexible working among men can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing recognition of the importance of work-life balance and the changing nature of employment. The pandemic has also accelerated this trend, with many employers adopting remote working policies to keep their businesses running during lockdowns. According to a recent survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 62% of employers said they planned to offer more flexible working options in the future. For men, the flexibility to work from home or adapt their hours can be particularly beneficial when it comes to caring for elderly relatives or dealing with other personal commitments. The study found that over a third (35%) of men with caring responsibilities would like to work flexibly or part-time, compared to 25% of women in the same situation. However, despite this growing demand, there are still barriers to flexible working for men. The study found that 52% of men felt that their employer did not offer enough flexible working options, compared to 39% of women. And while 51% of women felt that flexible working was important to them, only 43% of men agreed. One reason for this difference in attitude may be the perceived stigma surrounding men who take on caring responsibilities or who prioritize work-life balance over long hours in the office. There is a cultural expectation that men should be the primary breadwinners and providers, which can make it difficult for them to request flexible working arrangements. To address this issue, there needs to be a shift in attitudes towards flexible working and caregiving among men and employers. Surveys suggest that men are increasingly taking on more caring responsibilities, with one in ten now the primary carer in their household. Employers need to recognize this change and offer flexible working options that meet the needs of all their employees, regardless of gender. In conclusion, the trend towards flexible working is not just about women and childcare. Men are also demanding more flexibility in their work arrangements, and employers need to adapt to meet this demand. By offering flexible working options, employers can attract and retain a more diverse workforce, improve employee morale, and create a better work-life balance for all their staff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Defence review under way says Michael Fallon,"Addressing MPs in Parliament, Michael Fallon, the Secretary of State for Defence, acknowledged the commencement of a new defence review process. The announcement came amidst growing concerns over national security and the evolving threat landscape. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), Mr Fallon reminded his audience, was criticised by many for failing to anticipate uprisings and subsequent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. ""We cannot afford to make the same mistakes,"" he asserted, emphasising that the current review would be comprehensive and forward-looking. The aim, he stated, was to ensure the Armed Forces were equipped to deal with current and future threats, both in their traditional roles and in the complex, hybrid warfare environments that have emerged in recent years. Mr Fallon acknowledged that the defence budget would remain under pressure, but reiterated the government's commitment to maintaining a strong and capable military. He emphasised the need for greater efficiency and value for money, stressing that every pound spent would be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. Turning to specific areas, Mr Fallon hinted at renewed focus on cybersecurity and space capabilities, reflecting the growing importance of these domains in modern warfare. He also alluded to the need to enhance the UK's nuclear deterrent, in light of the growing assertiveness of potential adversaries. Moreover, Mr Fallon underlined the importance of international cooperation and partnerships, particularly in the context of countering terrorism and dealing with the refugee crisis. He called for a renewed emphasis on NATO and the European Union, as well as strengthening ties with key partners like the United States and Australia. Throughout his statement, Mr Fallon emphasised the need for a robust and flexible defence posture, capable of adapting to an increasingly complex and uncertain world. He acknowledged that the review would not provide all the answers, but expressed confidence that it would serve as a solid foundation for the UK's defence and security in the years to come. In conclusion, Mr Fallon's statement marked the beginning of a critical process that will shape the UK's defence and security landscape for the foreseeable future. The review, he insisted, would not be driven by ideology or dogma, but by a clear-eyed assessment of the risks and challenges facing the country. And while the outcome remains to be seen, one thing was clear: the UK's defence and security priorities will continue to evolve in response to an ever-changing world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Â£5.6m Newbridge Memo makeover gets under way,"Scaffolding is set to go up at the Grade II listed Newbridge Memorial Hall, known as the Memo, in Caerphilly county. It follows an eight-year fundraising campaign by the hall's trustees and will mark the beginning of a significant makeover for the much-loved community venue. The Memo, which was built in 1928, has been a hub of arts, culture, and social activity for Caerphilly and the surrounding areas. However, the passage of time and the increasing demands of a growing user base have taken their toll on the building's infrastructure. With a total cost of Â£5.6m, the refurbishment project will see the Memo's exterior restored to its former glory, as well as significant internal upgrades. These improvements will include the installation of a new sprinkler system, the replacement of the roof, and the modernisation of the building's electrical and plumbing systems. In addition, the hall's auditorium will undergo a major overhaul. This will involve the installation of new seating, as well as the upgrade of the sound and lighting systems. The goal is to provide a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the thousands of people who attend events at the Memo each year. The project has been made possible by the tireless efforts of the Memo's trustees, who have spent the last eight years fundraising to make the renovation a reality. They have organised countless events, appeals, and community initiatives to raise the necessary funds. One of the trustees, Ann Jones, expressed her excitement about the upcoming renovation. ""The Memo is at the heart of our community, and we are thrilled to finally be able to begin this important work,"" she said. ""We know how much this building means to so many people, and we are determined to ensure that it continues to thrive for generations to come."" The work is expected to take around two years to complete, during which time the Memo will remain open for certain events and activities. However, some parts of the building will be closed to the public for safety reasons. Despite the disruption, the trustees are confident that the community will rally behind the project and support the Memo during this time. ""We understand that there will be some inconvenience during the renovation,"" said Jones. ""But we also know that our supporters are passionate about the Memo and will do what they can to help us through this period."" As the scaffolding goes up and the renovation gets underway, the Memo's trustees and supporters can look forward to a brighter future for their beloved community venue. With its restored exterior, modernised facilities, and continued commitment to arts and culture, the Newbridge Memorial Hall is poised to remain an essential part of Caerphilly and beyond for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus funeral restrictions: 'Other families shouldn't have to go through this',"Iolo Cheung, BBC News Only 12 people were allowed to attend Bernard Lawrence's funeral last week. His granddaughter Ffion Evans described the experience as frustrating, as many other Covid-19 measures have been eased in recent months. Bernard, who was 71, had spent the last few weeks of his life in a hospital, where he contracted the virus. Ffion explained that due to the current regulations in place, she and her family could not have a proper send-off for their beloved grandfather. ""It was heart-wrenching to know that we couldn't have more than a handful of people there to mourn with us,"" Ffion said, her voice filled with emotion. ""Bernard was a larger-than-life figure in our community. He had so many friends and loved ones, and it just didn't seem fair that only a select few could be there to say their goodbyes."" Ffion went on to explain that the funeral home had strict guidelines in place, and that these rules applied regardless of the size of the venue. She also shared that some of Bernard's closest friends and colleagues had been unable to attend due to having to self-isolate or living abroad. As the funeral service began, Ffion and her family watched as their loved ones were unable to join them due to the restrictions. They could only watch on as the service was livestreamed, feeling a sense of loss and sadness that they simply couldn't be there in person. Ffion is not alone in her experience. Many families across the UK have faced similar situations during the pandemic, with funerals being limited to a certain number of attendees. And while the rules have been eased in some areas, such as social distancing and the wearing of masks, the restrictions on funeral attendance have remained in place. The government has defended the restrictions, stating that they are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. However, many families feel that the rules are unfair and have called for them to be reconsidered. Ffion and her family are left to grieve the loss of their beloved grandfather in their own way, with the knowledge that they were unable to provide him with the send-off he deserved. ""It's just not fair that other families have to go through this,"" Ffion said. ""Bernard was a kind and generous man who would have wanted to see all of his friends and loved ones there to celebrate his life. It's a terrible feeling to know that we couldn't give him that."" As the pandemic continues, it is hoped that the government will reconsider the funeral attendance restrictions, allowing families to come together to mourn their loved ones in a more meaningful way.

Tinder to introduce in-app background checks,"By Cody Godwin, BBC News, San Francisco Later this year, Tinder will allow users to conduct background checks on potential matches using the app, making it the latest in a series of moves by dating platforms to prioritize safety and security. The move comes amid growing concerns over online safety and the prevalence of fake profiles and catfishing on dating apps. The background checks will be facilitated through a third-party service called TenantScreen, which specializes in providing public records information. Users will be able to access this information by entering the name or mobile number of their prospective dates. ""Safety is a top priority for us at Tinder, and we understand that our users want to feel secure when they're using our app,"" said Elie Seidman, CEO of Tinder. ""Background checks are an important tool in helping our users make informed decisions about who they choose to connect with."" The background checks will include criminal records, sex offender registries, and civil records such as eviction notices, liens, and judgments. The information will be presented in a clear and easy-to-understand format within the Tinder app. Tinder is not the first dating app to introduce background checks. In 2018, Bumble announced that it was partnering with the background check company Checkr to offer users the ability to run background checks on their matches. Other apps, such as OkCupid and Plenty of Fish, have also offered background check services for some time. However, the implementation of background checks on Tinder, which has over 50 million users, is likely to have a greater impact on the broader dating app landscape. Some privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the potential for misuse of this information, particularly if it falls into the wrong hands. Tinder has said that it will take steps to protect user privacy, including encrypting the data and limiting access to authorized users only. ""We take user privacy very seriously, and we have implemented strict security measures to ensure that this information is only accessible to the intended users,"" said Seidman. Despite these concerns, many users have welcomed the move. A recent survey conducted by the dating app Hinge found that over 50% of respondents said they would be more likely to use a dating app if it offered background checks. ""It's important for me to feel safe when I'm using a dating app, and background checks are a crucial part of that,"" said Sarah Johnson, a Tinder user from San Francisco. ""I think it's a great step forward for the industry as a whole."" The introduction of background checks on Tinder is just the latest in a series of measures the company has taken to prioritize user safety. In 2019, Tinder introduced a feature that allows users to report inappropriate behavior and block contacts, and it has also partnered with organizations such as the National Center",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday. They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky to protect the health and safety of cast and crew as they resume filming in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. One of the most notable aspects of the new guidelines is the extensive use of green screens and virtual production. These techniques allow for scenes to be filmed with minimal or no physical interaction between cast and crew, greatly reducing the risk of transmission. Green screens are not a new concept to the TV industry, but their use is expected to increase significantly in the coming months. The broadcasters have also implemented strict social distancing guidelines on set. This includes maintaining a two-metre distance between individuals where possible, limiting the number of people present at any one time, and organising workspaces to ensure adequate spacing. Crew members have been advised to wear masks and gloves when necessary, and regular temperature checks will be carried out. Another key element of the back-to-work plan is the implementation of a comprehensive testing regime. Regular testing for COVID-19 will be carried out on all cast and crew, with results being recorded and monitored to ensure the safety of the production as a whole. Testing will also be available for any visitors to the set, such as agents or agents. Productions will be required to carry out a detailed risk assessment before filming begins, and regular updates will be provided to cast and crew to keep them informed of any changes or developments. The broadcasters have also pledged to be flexible and adaptable in their approach, and to review and update their guidelines as necessary. The new guidelines will apply to all BBC productions, both in the UK and abroad. The corporation's director-general, Tim Davie, said: ""These guidelines are an essential step in enabling us to resume filming safely. Our priority is the wellbeing of our staff, freelancers, contributors and the public. We will continue to work closely with the industry, the government, and unions to develop and adapt our approach as the situation evolves."" ITV's director of television, Kevin Lygo, added: ""These guidelines provide a framework for the safe return to production, while also taking account of the need to be flexible and adaptable in the face of ongoing uncertainty. Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of our staff, freelancers, contributors and the public, and to protect the integrity of our programmes."" The new guidelines represent a significant shift for the TV industry, which has been largely shut down since lockdown measures were introduced in March. While the return to production will bring welcome news to many, it is important that all involved remain vigilant and continue to follow the guidelines to ensure the safety of all concerned.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Merthyr baby's death 'could have been avoided',"Tiffany Gillard's son Jenson James Francis took his last breath at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on 21 June 2018. The inquest at Pontypridd Coroner's Court, which commenced on 22 March 2023, seeks to unravel the circumstances surrounding the 11-month-old's tragic demise. The hearing comes after Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board was criticized for the standard of care Jenson received in the hospital. The court heard that Jenson, who was born prematurely, had been admitted to the hospital on 19 June 2018 due to respiratory problems. His condition worsened over the next few days, and he was placed on a ventilator to assist his breathing. However, the ventilator was not set up correctly, according to the evidence presented at the inquest. The court heard testimony from health professionals who admitted that they had failed to follow proper procedures in setting up the ventilator. The ventilator settings were not checked regularly, and when they were, it was discovered that the oxygen levels were not being maintained at the required level. This resulted in Jenson receiving insufficient oxygen, leading to brain damage and eventual death. The inquest also revealed that Jenson had not been given the appropriate medication to manage his seizures effectively. The health board admitted that the medication was not administered on time and that there were errors in the recording of Jenson's medication administration. The Coroner, Mr. Stewart Varley, expressed his disappointment and concern over the standard of care Jenson received in the hospital. He stated that had the correct procedures been followed, Jenson's death could have been prevented. Mr. Varley also stated that he would be writing to the Health Care Professions Council to consider whether any disciplinary action was necessary against the health professionals involved in Jenson's care. Tiffany Gillard, Jenson's mother, who was present at the inquest, broke down in tears as she listened to the evidence. She described the pain and heartache her family had gone through since Jenson's death. She called for better training and resources for health professionals to ensure that such tragedies do not occur again. The inquest continues, and it is expected that the health board will be called upon to explain how they plan to improve the standard of care at the hospital and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The family of Jenson James Francis hopes that the inquest will provide some closure and bring about positive changes to ensure the safety and wellbeing of other children in their care.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
MoT changes come into force in Northern Ireland,"Under the new rules, more than 20 extra checks will be carried out on vehicles during their MoT tests in Northern Ireland. These modifications, which come into effect from today, are primarily focused on electronic warning systems to ensure the roadworthiness and safety of vehicles. The checks will mostly concern headlamp and airbag indicators, requiring testers to examine the status of these crucial safety features. If a warning light is illuminated, the vehicle will fail its MoT test until the issue is resolved. Tyre pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) will also undergo rigorous assessment. With the increasing prevalence of TPMS in modern vehicles, this change ensures that under-inflated or faulty tyres do not pose a risk to drivers and passengers. Power steering monitoring systems have been added to the list. These systems aid in the safe manoeuvring of vehicles, particularly in parking situations and at low speeds. A fault in this system can make controlling a vehicle challenging, leading to potential accidents. The changes will only apply to vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 2012. For older vehicles, the existing MoT test requirements will remain in place. This distinction is essential to clarify, as older vehicles may not have these advanced safety features. The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has stated that these updates are part of a continuous effort to improve road safety in Northern Ireland. The DfI's Roads and Transportation Service (RTS) has also emphasised that these modifications will not result in a significant increase in MoT test fees. According to the RTS, the adjustments will not apply to vehicles undergoing their initial MoT test, known as the First MoT Test. This test, which is mandatory for vehicles three years after their registration or when they are ten years old, will continue to follow the existing MoT test criteria. The new rules are expected to impact approximately 140,000 vehicles in Northern Ireland. The RTS has urged vehicle owners to familiarise themselves with these test requirements and to ensure that their vehicles are ready for the MoT test. This advice is particularly important for those with vehicles that may require additional safety modifications or repairs before their next test date. In conclusion, the new MoT test changes in Northern Ireland underline the commitment to enhancing road safety through rigorous vehicle inspections. By introducing more stringent checks on electronic warning systems, the DfI aims to minimise risks and prevent accidents on Northern Ireland's roads.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Salisbury city best performing in GB shop vacancy table,"I. Salisbury's Thriving Business Environment: lowest shop vacancy rate in the UK (300-330 words) Salisbury, a historic city located in Wiltshire, England, has long been renowned for its picturesque beauty and rich heritage. However, in recent years, this ancient city has gained another distinction - it boasts the lowest shop vacancy rate in the country. According to the latest report by the Local Data Company, Salisbury's vacancy rate stands at 7.7%, making it the most desirable location for retailers and businesses in the United Kingdom. Cambridge and Chesterfield follow closely behind with vacancy rates of 8.5% and 8.7% respectively. These figures represent a significant improvement for Salisbury, which has seen a steady decline in its vacancy rate over the past few years. This trend is particularly noteworthy given the challenges that many high streets across the UK have faced due to increasing competition from online retailers and changing consumer behavior. Lucinda Boddy, a local businesswoman who recently closed her shop in Salisbury, was among those who expressed concerns about the city's future. In an interview with the BBC, she claimed that the city was ""dying"" and that she had been forced to shut her doors due to lack of footfall. However, the latest data seems to contradict her sentiments, painting a rosy picture of the city's commercial landscape. II. Driving Factors Behind Salisbury's Success (330-360 words) So, what is driving this positive trend in Salisbury? One factor is the city's strong economy. Salisbury benefits from a diverse and prosperous local economy, with a significant number of businesses operating in sectors such as technology, education, and tourism. This economic vitality translates into a strong consumer base, which in turn attracts retailers and businesses to the city. Another factor is the city's commitment to regeneration and development. Salisbury City Council has implemented several initiatives to revitalize the city center, including the creation of new public spaces, the installation of modern street furniture, and the restoration of historic buildings. These efforts have helped to create a vibrant and attractive environment, which in turn draws visitors and businesses to the area. III. Challenges Ahead (360-400 words) Despite its success, Salisbury is not without its challenges. One major issue is the impact of online retail on traditional high street businesses. Salisbury, like many other cities, has seen a rise in the number of empty units as retailers struggle to compete with the convenience and lower prices offered by e-commerce giants. To address this issue, the city council has launched a number of initiatives to support local businesses, including the creation of a business improvement district and the provision of grants to help businesses adapt to",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The device was subjected to waves with heights of up to 10 meters, which allowed engineers to assess its performance under extreme conditions. Aquamarine Power's Oyster wave energy converter uses a floating body that moves up and down in response to wave motion. The device's hinged flaps, known as 'droplets,' open and close in response to wave action, generating electricity as they move. The company's CEO, Maf Smith, expressed his excitement about the test results, stating that ""the successful testing of the Oyster phase 3 device at EMEC marks a significant milestone in the development of our technology. We've proven that our device can generate consistent and reliable power in some of the world's toughest wave conditions."" Aquamarine Power's Oyster wave energy converter has the potential to revolutionize the renewable energy sector. Wave energy is a promising source of clean, renewable energy, but currently, only a small fraction of the world's wave resources are being harnessed. The Oyster device's ability to generate power in even the most challenging wave conditions could make it a game-changer in the industry. The company is now focusing on the next stage of development, which involves scaling up the technology and preparing it for commercial deployment. Aquamarine Power is currently in discussions with potential partners and investors, with the aim of bringing the Oyster device to market as soon as possible. In conclusion, the successful testing of Aquamarine Power's Oyster wave energy converter at EMEC is a significant step forward in the development of this promising technology. The device's ability to generate consistent and reliable power in even the most challenging wave conditions could make it a game-changer in the renewable energy sector.

A third of domestic abuse victims 'cannot get legal aid',"The Justice Select Committee, in its recent report, voiced grave concerns about the impact of the government's legal aid changes on domestic abuse victims. The committee, comprised of 11 members of Parliament, found that nearly a third of domestic abuse victims are unable to access legal aid, leaving them at a significant disadvantage when seeking to leave abusive partners. Without the support of a lawyer, victims found themselves in a precarious position. The committee heard harrowing testimonies of individuals who, despite their desire to leave, were unable to do so due to financial constraints. The absence of legal representation made it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system, and left them vulnerable to intimidation and further abuse. The committee's report criticised the government's legal aid changes and said they had ""harmed the most vulnerable in our society."" The cuts, implemented in 2013, reduced the scope of legal aid for cases involving domestic violence and child contact disputes. The changes meant that victims who did not meet certain financial criteria were no longer eligible for legal aid, leaving them to represent themselves in court. The report highlighted the disproportionate impact of the changes on women. According to the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 98% of their callers were women. The committee acknowledged that ""women are more likely than men to be victims of domestic abuse, and the legal aid changes have disproportionately affected women."" The committee also raised concerns about the impact of the changes on children. It found that ""children who are witnesses to domestic abuse are significantly more likely to suffer harm, both in the short and long term."" The absence of legal aid for parents seeking contact with their children in the context of domestic abuse was a matter of great concern. The committee recommended that the government reinstate legal aid for all domestic abuse cases, including those involving child contact disputes. It also called for the introduction of a presumption of legal aid for victims of domestic abuse in all family proceedings. The report's findings were echoed by various charities and organisations working to support domestic abuse victims. Women's Aid, a leading charity in the field, described the legal aid changes as ""a disaster for survivors of domestic abuse"" and called for the government to take urgent action. As the committee's report was released, it was clear that the issue of legal aid for domestic abuse victims was one that required urgent attention. The government's changes had left many victims without the support they needed to leave abusive partners and rebuild their lives. It was hoped that the report's recommendations would lead to much-needed reforms and ensure that victims of domestic abuse were no longer denied access to justice.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
BCP Council leader Vikki Slade ousted in second confidence vote loss,"Lib Dem Vikki Slade failed to win support over a Tory motion stating ""a high level of public frustration and mistrust"" in her administration during a dramatic full council meeting at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council on Wednesday. The vote of no confidence, which was called following a series of controversies and perceived mismanagement, marked the second time the leader has faced such a challenge since taking office in May 2019. Despite her efforts to reassure councillors and the public that her administration was making progress, the motion gained significant momentum in the days leading up to the vote. The Tories, who have long been critical of the Lib Dem-controlled council, were joined by several independents in their call for change. Tory group leader, Cllr Peter Finney, spoke passionately during the debate, urging colleagues to consider the impact on local residents. ""This council has lost its way,"" he said. ""We cannot continue with the current leadership, which has demonstrated a lack of transparency, accountability and effective decision-making."" Cllr Slade, who had earlier defended her record, acknowledged the concerns raised but argued that the council was making progress. ""I understand the frustration and mistrust some residents feel, but I believe we are moving in the right direction,"" she told the chamber. ""We have delivered on many promises and are working to address the remaining challenges."" However, her words did little to sway the opposition. The motion was carried by a significant majority, with 42 votes in favour, 19 against, and 15 abstentions. Cllr Slade, who had led the council through some of its most turbulent times, including the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of the devastating fires, was visibly shocked and emotional as she left the chamber. The council now faces an uncertain future, with the Tories set to form a new administration. Cllr Finney, who is expected to take on the role of leader, has pledged to restore trust and confidence in the local authority. ""We will work tirelessly to put things right and get Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole back on track,"" he said. The result of the vote has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some expressing relief that change is on the horizon, while others fearing the unknown.

Kent MPs lobbied to support Thames estuary airport,"Sittingbourne and Sheppey's Gordon Henderson, Dartford's Gareth Johnson, and Gravesham's Adam Holloway, all Tory MPs from the Thames estuary area, have recently met with Daniel Moylan, the man spearheading the campaign for a new Thames estuary airport. The trio of parliamentarians have expressed their support for the project in the past, but following their meeting with Moylan, they have come under criticism from some local residents and environmental groups. At a recent press conference, Henderson, Johnson, and Holloway reiterated their stance on the airport, stating that they believe it will bring significant economic benefits to their constituencies. ""We've seen first-hand the potential that this airport could bring,"" Henderson said. ""It will create thousands of jobs, both during construction and once the airport is up and running. It will also provide a much-needed boost to the local economy and make the area more attractive to businesses."" Johnson added that the airport would also improve transport links in the area, making it easier for people to travel to and from Europe. ""The Thames estuary airport would provide a much-needed alternative to the congested airspace around Heathrow and Gatwick,"" he said. ""It would also make it easier for people to travel to Europe without having to face the long queues and delays at other airports."" However, not everyone is convinced by the arguments in favour of the airport. Local residents and environmental groups have raised concerns about the potential impact on the environment and the health of local people. Some have also expressed concerns about the cost of the project and whether the economic benefits will outweigh the costs. Moylan, who is the Thames Estuary Airport Ltd chairman, has acknowledged these concerns but remains optimistic about the project. ""We understand the concerns that have been raised, but we believe that we can address them through careful planning and consultation with local communities,"" he said. ""We believe that the airport will bring significant economic benefits to the area, and we are committed to working with local stakeholders to ensure that any negative impacts are minimised."" Despite the criticism, Henderson, Johnson, and Holloway remain steadfast in their support for the airport. ""It didn't change my mind. I still feel that an airport in the Thames estuary is the best solution for the region,"" Henderson said. ""We need to look at the long-term benefits, not just the short-term concerns. I believe that this airport will be a game-changer for our area.""

"Unilever: Ice cream in, personal hygiene out in lockdown","The firm, Unilever, reported a significant shift in consumer behavior during the lockdown period, with sales of ice cream experiencing a substantial surge while demand for personal hygiene products took a hit. In the three months leading up to June, Unilever witnessed a remarkable 26% increase in ice cream sales. This trend was observed across all markets, with consumers turning to comforting treats to brighten their days amidst the uncertainty and upheaval brought about by the pandemic. The company attributed this growth to the rise in home consumption, as people spent more time at home and sought to recreate the pleasurable experiences of eating out in the comfort of their own homes. Ice cream, with its ability to transport consumers to happier times, became a popular choice for many. Unilever's ice cream brands, including Magnum, Ben & Jerry's, and Wall's, benefited significantly from this trend. However, it was a different story for Unilever's personal care division. Sales of shampoo, conditioner, and deodorant all saw a decline, with some markets reporting drops of as much as 20%. The company attributed this decrease to the closure of salons and barbershops, which forced consumers to delay their usual grooming routines. Moreover, with many people working from home and opting for casual attire, there was less of a need for deodorant. Despite these challenges, Unilever remains confident about its prospects. The company's size and diversity have allowed it to weather various economic downturns in the past, and it is well-positioned to adapt to the current situation. Additionally, Unilever has been quick to respond to the changing market conditions, expanding its ice cream production capacity and investing in digital marketing to reach consumers at home. The pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted traditional consumer habits, leading to unprecedented shifts in demand across various industries. Unilever's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of staying agile and responsive in the face of uncertainty. As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, companies like Unilever will undoubtedly play a crucial role in helping consumers navigate these challenging times. Unilever's success in the ice cream market is not just limited to the current situation, though. The company has been investing in the category for years, with a focus on innovation and sustainability. In recent times, it has introduced new product lines, such as plant-based ice creams and low-calorie options, to cater to evolving consumer preferences. It has also taken steps to reduce the carbon footprint of its ice cream production processes, aligning with the growing demand for environmentally responsible products. As the world gradually begins to return to a semblance of normalcy, it will be interesting to see how consumer behavior evolves.

He concluded, ""It's clear that Grimshaw is a talented and dedicated presenter, and his appointment to Radio 1 is a much-needed breath of fresh air in a sea of samey morning shows."" The Daily Mirror's Susan Griffiths agreed, stating that Grimshaw's ""youthful energy and enthusiasm was exactly what Radio 1 needed."" Griffiths went on to praise Grimshaw's interviewing skills, saying, ""His ability to draw out the best in his guests and keep the conversation flowing made for engaging and insightful interviews."" She concluded, ""Grimshaw's debut was a triumph, and he has proven himself to be a worthy addition to the Radio 1 family."" The criticism was not all positive, however. The Mail on Sunday's Quentin Letts took issue with Grimshaw's style, stating that his ""chatty, off-the-cuff approach was disorganized and distracting."" Letts went on to criticize Grimshaw's use of pop culture references, saying, ""They felt forced and out of place on a radio show, and detracted from the overall listening experience."" Despite these criticisms, Letts conceded that Grimshaw's ""energy and enthusiasm was undeniable,"" and that he ""showed great potential for growth and improvement."" Overall, Nick Grimshaw's debut on Radio 1 was met with largely positive reviews from critics. His youthful energy, enthusiasm for new music, and ability",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lancashire County Council election: Tories gain control,"The authority had been under no overall control, with Labour the biggest party holding 36 seats, four more than the Conservatives. Nationally, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) had made significant gains in the 2013 local elections, but in Lancashire, they failed to make a dent, securing only one seat. The election results on Friday, May 3, 2013, marked a turnaround for the Conservatives. They managed to gain six seats from Labour, and the Liberal Democrats lost all but two of their seats. The Tories now held 38 seats, enough to form a minority administration. Richard Walsh, the new Conservative leader of the council, expressed his delight at the outcome. ""We are delighted to have been given the opportunity to lead Lancashire County Council,"" he said. ""We have a clear mandate from the electorate to deliver on our manifesto promises."" Walsh pledged to focus on improving services for residents, following years of austerity measures imposed by the central government. ""We will prioritise investment in our schools, roads, and care services,"" he added. ""We recognise the challenges facing local government, and we are committed to working collaboratively with our partners to find solutions."" Labour leader, Azhar Ali, conceded defeat, but vowed to hold the new administration accountable. ""I would like to congratulate the Conservatives on their victory,"" he said. ""However, we will be holding them to account for their promises and ensuring they deliver for the people of Lancashire."" The result was seen as a significant victory for the Conservatives, who had been struggling to regain ground after the 2010 general election. The party had made gains in other areas, such as Essex and Surrey, but Lancashire was a crucial win, given the previous control of Labour. The election also marked a significant decline for the Liberal Democrats, who had been the junior partner in the previous coalition administration. They now held only two seats, a stark reminder of their loss of influence following the 2010 coalition government. The UKIP's failure to make any real impact in Lancashire was a disappointment for the party, which had been hoping to build on its successes in the European and national elections. However, they remained a significant force in British politics, and many pundits believed that their influence would continue to grow in the years to come. With the new administration in place, the focus now shifted to implementing their manifesto promises and addressing the challenges facing Lancashire County Council. The coming months would be crucial in determining the success of the new administration and its ability to deliver for the people of Lancashire.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Concern at mortality rates at two Lanarkshire hospitals,"Monklands and Wishaw General Hospitals in Lanarkshire, Scotland, have raised concerns after recording higher mortality rates than the national average during the last quarter. Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS), the country's health care regulator, has announced that it will launch investigations into these hospitals, along with Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride. NHS Lanarkshire, the health board responsible for managing these hospitals, confirmed the figures and stated that they were ""working closely with Healthcare Improvement Scotland to understand the causes of these statistics."" According to NHS Lanarkshire, the higher mortality rates were due to various factors, including the complex health conditions of patients and the aging population. However, opposition politicians and patient advocacy groups have called for a more in-depth inquiry, questioning the quality of care and the resources available at these hospitals. They argue that the higher mortality rates are a clear indication of underlying issues that need to be addressed urgently. Mortality rates, or the number of deaths in a given population during a specific time period, are an important indicator of the quality of healthcare services. According to the Scottish Government's Annual Review of Healthcare Statistics, the national mortality rate for acute hospitals was 7.5% during the last quarter. Monklands Hospital recorded a rate of 8.1%, while Wishaw General Hospital reported a rate of 8.3%. The Scottish National Party (SNP), the ruling party in Scotland, has responded to the news by expressing concern and promising to take action. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf stated that the Scottish Government was ""committed to ensuring that all patients receive high-quality, safe and effective care,"" and that an investigation was necessary to identify the root causes of the higher mortality rates. Meanwhile, patient advocacy groups, such as the Scottish Patients' Association, have called for greater transparency and accountability from NHS Lanarkshire and the Scottish Government. They argue that the public deserves to know what steps are being taken to address the underlying issues and improve the quality of care at these hospitals. The investigations by Healthcare Improvement Scotland are expected to focus on various aspects of care, including clinical governance, staffing levels, and patient safety. The findings of the inquiries are likely to be published in the coming months, and will provide valuable insights into the state of healthcare services in Lanarkshire and beyond. In the meantime, NHS Lanarkshire has assured the public that it is taking immediate action to address the issues identified in the mortality rate data. The health board has announced that it will be implementing a number of measures, including additional training for staff, increased funding for resources, and improved communication with patients and their families. The higher mortality rates at Monklands and Wishaw General Hospitals have raised important questions about the quality of healthcare services in Lanarkshire and Scotland as a whole.

UK plans Â£3m no-deal medicine transport,"By Howard Mustoe & Joe Miller, Business reporters The UK government is making plans to spend up to Â£3 million on an ""express freight service"" to transport essential medicines, blood, and transplant tissue in case of a no-deal Brexit. This comes as the deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union quickly approaches. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has issued a tender for a logistics company to provide the service, which would run from October 2021 to March 2022. The contract is intended to ensure the continuity of medicine supplies in the event that the UK and EU fail to reach a trade agreement by 1 September. The DHSC has stated that the service, which would operate between the UK and the EU, would be used ""primarily for chilled and ambient medicines, blood and transplant tissue."" The tender documentation also mentions that the service could be used for ""some frozen and other speciality products."" However, experts have warned that the deadline of 1 September set for the deal could make it difficult to secure the necessary arrangements in time. ""The timeframe for this is extremely tight,"" said Dr. John Smith, a professor of pharmaceutical policy at the University of London. ""Securing a logistics provider and the necessary paperwork to allow the transport of these goods across the EU border will be a challenge."" The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has previously stated that in a no-deal scenario, there could be delays and disruptions to the supply chain for medicines and medical devices. This is due to the need for new customs procedures and regulatory checks. The government's plans to hire an express freight service are not the only measure being taken to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit. The DHSC has also been working with pharmaceutical companies to stockpile six weeks' worth of medicines. Additionally, the UK has been working to secure agreements with individual EU countries to ensure the continued supply of some medicines. For example, the UK and Ireland have agreed to maintain their current arrangements for the exchange of medicines and medical devices. However, Dr. Smith cautioned that these measures may not be enough. ""While these steps are important, they only go so far,"" he said. ""The UK government needs to be preparing for the worst-case scenario, which is a complete breakdown in the supply chain for medicines."" The government has insisted that it is making every effort to secure a trade deal with the EU. However, the lack of progress in negotiations and the tight deadline mean that the risk of a no-deal Brexit remains a real possibility. In the meantime, the tender for the express freight service will close on 19 July. The successful bidder is expected to be announced by the end of",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Russia halts Lithuania dairy imports in trade row,"Russia's consumer watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, announced on Tuesday that it was halting imports of Lithuanian dairy products due to unacceptable levels of yeast and mould. The move comes amidst an ongoing trade dispute between Moscow and Vilnius. Lithuania is already involved in a bitter row with Russia over the transit of Polish and Baltic freight trains to the Kaliningrad region. The Kremlin has imposed a series of retaliatory measures against Lithuania, including restrictions on the import of certain agricultural goods. The ban on Lithuanian dairy imports was announced following inspections of consignments at the Russian border. Rospotrebnadzor said that the products did not meet Russian health and safety standards, with some samples containing excessive amounts of yeast and mould. Lithuanian authorities have disputed the findings, with the country's agriculture minister, Simas Kisielius, describing the Russian inspections as politically motivated. Kisielius has called on the European Commission to intervene in the dispute and to ensure that Lithuanian products are treated fairly in the Russian market. The ban on Lithuanian dairy imports could have significant economic consequences for both countries. Lithuania is a major dairy producer and exports a significant proportion of its output to Russia. In 2020, Lithuanian dairy exports to Russia were worth over â¬150 million. The dispute also risks further damaging already strained relations between Moscow and Vilnius. Lithuania has been a vocal critic of Russian actions in Ukraine and has taken a leading role in efforts to strengthen NATO's eastern flank. Russia, for its part, has accused Lithuania of harbouring anti-Russian sentiments and of seeking to provoke tensions in the region. The European Commission has called on both sides to resolve the dispute through dialogue and to avoid any actions that could undermine the economic integration of the European Single Market. The Commission has also threatened to take action against Russia if the ban on Lithuanian dairy imports is not lifted. Despite the Commission's intervention, it remains to be seen whether the dispute will be resolved anytime soon. With tensions between Moscow and Vilnius continuing to simmer, the future of trade relations between the two countries remains uncertain. In the meantime, Lithuanian farmers and dairy producers are facing an uncertain future. With the Russian market off-limits, they will need to find new buyers for their products if they are to avoid significant financial losses. For many, however, the prospect of finding new markets in the midst of a global pandemic is a daunting one. As the standoff between Russia and Lithuania continues, both sides are digging in their heels, with each accusing the other of bad faith.

Coronavirus: London key workers to star on cover of British Vogue,"In an extraordinary tribute to the unsung heroes of the coronavirus pandemic, British Vogue's July issue will showcase three key workers from London on its cover. A London Overground train driver, an east London midwife, and a King's Cross supermarket worker will all take centre stage, their faces beaming with resilience and determination. Photographer Jamie Hawkesworth captured the trio in a series of powerful images, each one highlighting the essential role they play in keeping the city running amidst the ongoing health crisis. The train driver, dressed in her uniform and wearing a protective face shield, is seen staring intently into the distance, her expression a mix of focus and fatigue. The midwife, holding a newborn baby in one arm and wearing a protective gown and mask, exudes a sense of calm and nurturing strength. The supermarket worker, with a trolley full of groceries and a mask covering his face, cuts an unassuming figure yet conveys the unwavering dedication of those keeping the food supply chain operational. The cover story, penned by editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, celebrates these individuals and the countless others who continue to work tirelessly on the frontlines. Enninful, who has long championed diversity and inclusion in fashion, notes that the cover serves as a reminder of the ""true value of essential workers and the strength of the human spirit."" The train driver, identified as 31-year-old Maria, speaks of the challenges and rewards of her job, revealing the deep connection she feels with her passengers. ""They trust me with their lives every day,"" she says. ""It's a big responsibility, but it's also a privilege to be there for them."" The midwife, 28-year-old Amelia, shares her experiences of delivering babies during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of her role in bringing new life into the world amidst such uncertainty. ""It's a surreal feeling, but it's also incredibly grounding,"" she reflects. ""I want these new parents to know that no matter what, they're not alone."" The supermarket worker, 45-year-old Tom, discusses the immense pressure of keeping up with the demand for essential supplies, all while ensuring the safety of his colleagues and customers. ""We're used to being busy, but this is a whole new level,"" he admits, before expressing his gratitude for the community support he's received during these challenging times. Together, these stories offer a poignant reminder of the human spirit's ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity.

British Steel in talks with government to avert collapse,"Sources close to the owners of British Steel, Greybull Capital, have revealed that the future of the troubled company will be discussed at ministerial level as it faces the real possibility of collapse. The news comes after British Steel admitted that it requires further financial support from the government to help it through its current crisis. The steelmaker, which employs around 5,000 people in the UK, has been grappling with financial difficulties for some time. In recent months, it has been hit by a perfect storm of rising costs, falling prices, and weak demand. The company, which is the UK's second-largest steelmaker, has been trying to secure a new bailout from the government to keep it afloat. According to reports, the discussions between British Steel and the government are at an advanced stage. However, there are still some significant hurdles to overcome before a deal can be reached. One of the main sticking points is the size of the bailout and the conditions attached to it. Greybull Capital, which bought British Steel out of insolvency in 2016, is believed to be seeking a significant injection of cash to keep the business running. However, the government is said to be wary of committing too much money without securing some form of assurance that the company will be able to turn itself around in the long term. The potential collapse of British Steel would be a major blow for the UK steel industry and the communities that rely on it. The company is a key supplier of steel for the construction, automotive, and energy sectors, and any disruption to its operations could have far-reaching consequences. In a statement, a British Steel spokesperson said: ""We continue to engage with the government to discuss the financial support required to secure the future of the business. We remain hopeful that a positive outcome can be reached."" The government, for its part, has yet to comment on the reports of imminent discussions at ministerial level. However, Business Secretary Greg Clark is said to be closely involved in the negotiations and is seen as a key figure in any potential deal. As the talks continue, there is growing uncertainty about the future of British Steel. Workers and local communities are watching developments closely, hoping for a positive outcome that will secure the future of the business and the jobs it provides. However, with the financial situation remaining complex, there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached any time soon. In the meantime, British Steel continues to operate as normally as possible, with workers and management doing all they can to keep production running and meet customer orders. But the looming threat of collapse hangs over the company like a dark cloud, casting a shadow over its future and the future of the UK steel industry as a whole.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lagarde warns UK of pain ahead as Brexit approaches,"Kamal Ahmed: @bbckamal on Twitter Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), told the BBC in an exclusive interview that the Brexit process would be complicated, and the UK economy could face significant challenges as it moves towards leaving the European Union (EU). She acknowledged that the UK economy had performed more strongly than expected in recent years but warned that the country could face ""pain"" as it navigates the withdrawal process. Lagarde explained that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit had already taken a toll on investment and business confidence, which could lead to a slowdown in economic growth. Lagarde emphasised the importance of reaching a deal on the future relationship between the UK and the EU as soon as possible to minimise the disruption to trade and investment. She also urged the UK government to clarify its position on key issues such as the Irish border and the role of the European Court of Justice in regulating trade. The IMF chief expressed concerns about the potential impact of Brexit on the financial sector, which is a vital contributor to the UK economy. She noted that the City of London had been a global financial hub for decades, and its loss of access to the EU single market could result in the relocation of businesses and jobs to other European financial centres. Lagarde also highlighted the potential impact of Brexit on the UK's trade relationships with other countries. She pointed out that the EU was the UK's largest trading partner, and the loss of tariff-free access to the EU market could lead to higher trade costs and reduced competitiveness. The IMF chief also expressed her concerns about the UK's fiscal position, which she said was already stretched due to the significant public debt accumulated during the financial crisis. She urged the UK government to prioritise debt reduction and avoid excessive borrowing to fund public spending. Despite her warning of potential challenges, Lagarde acknowledged that there were opportunities for the UK economy outside the EU. She suggested that the UK could focus on developing its trade relationships with countries beyond Europe, such as the United States, China, and India. She also urged the UK government to invest in infrastructure, education, and research and development to boost productivity and competitiveness. In conclusion, Christine Lagarde's interview with the BBC provided a stark reminder of the economic challenges facing the UK as it moves towards Brexit. While acknowledging the UK's recent economic success, she urged caution and urged the government to take action to mitigate the potential negative effects of Brexit. She emphasised the importance of reaching a deal on the future relationship with the EU as soon as possible and prioritising debt reduction to ensure the long-term sustainability of the UK economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
US 'may free Israel spy Jonathan Pollard',"A US official told the New York Times that no decisions had been made regarding the potential release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, but confirmed that discussions had taken place between the American and Israeli governments on the matter. Pollard, who was born in the United States but holds Israeli citizenship, was arrested in 1985 for providing classified information to Israel. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1987, but has been eligible for parole since 2015. Israeli officials have long called for Pollard's release, arguing that the information he provided was not used for any harmful purposes and that he has served a sufficient prison sentence. The latest round of discussions comes amidst heightened tensions between the United States and Israel over the latter's plans to annex parts of the West Bank. The potential release of Pollard is a highly contentious issue in the United States, with many arguing that he betrayed his country and should serve the full length of his sentence. Others, however, believe that he has suffered enough and that it is time for him to be released, especially given his declining health. The White House has not commented on the issue, but a source close to the administration told the Times that any decision would be made in consultation with the intelligence community and would take into account the potential impact on US-Israeli relations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly raised the issue of Pollard's release during his phone conversations with US President Joe Biden, but it is unclear whether any progress has been made. The Israeli leader has also reportedly discussed the matter with other US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Pollard's case has been a source of tension between the United States and Israel for decades. In 1995, then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly agreed to a deal that would see Pollard released in exchange for the transfer of advanced military technology to the United States. However, the deal fell through when the Israeli cabinet failed to approve it. If Pollard is released, he would likely be sent to Israel, where he would be welcomed as a hero. However, any such move would be highly controversial in the United States, where many view him as a traitor. It would also strain already-tense relations between the United States and Israel, which are currently facing their biggest crisis in decades over the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. As the discussions continue, Pollard remains in prison, serving his sentence in a federal facility in North Carolina. His supporters have launched a campaign to secure his release, arguing that he has paid a heavy price for his actions and that it is time for him to be freed. The fate of Jonathan Pollard remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: his case continues to be a source of tension and controversy between the United States and Israel",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Government says sorry to women 'ignored' by doctors,"By Zoe Kleinman, Reporter, BBC News Nadine Dorries was giving a statement in Parliament, on the Cumberlege review, published on Wednesday. The review, which had heard from about 700 women, focused on vaginal mesh to treat incontinence and prolapse. Dorries, the Minister for Patient Safety, said the government was ""deeply sorry"" for the ""pain and suffering"" caused to thousands of women who had undergone mesh implants. The Cumberlege review, led by Baroness Cumberlege, was set up in response to long-standing concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaginal mesh implants. The review followed a campaign by patients and campaigners, who had been raising awareness of the potential harms of these devices for years. Ms Dorries acknowledged that the review had ""shone a light on the experiences of far too many women who have been ignored, dismissed, or not believed by the NHS."" She pledged that the government would take action to address the issues raised in the report, including improving access to information and support for women, and setting up a fund to support those who have been injured by the implants. The Minister also announced that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) would be conducting a further review of all mesh implants, to assess their safety and efficacy. This review would be carried out in consultation with patient groups and experts in the field. The announcement was welcomed by campaigners, who have been calling for action on this issue for many years. Sarah Brown, founder of the campaign group Sling the Mesh, said that the government's apology was ""long overdue."" She added that ""thousands of women have suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of these implants, and it's important that they are given the support they need to recover."" The Cumberlege review also made recommendations on how to improve the regulatory system for medical devices, to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. Ms Dorries said that the government would be taking these recommendations seriously, and that they would be implementing changes to the regulatory system to ensure that patient safety is a priority. The announcement comes as part of a wider push by the government to improve patient safety and reduce harm in the NHS. The Minister for Patient Safety also announced that there would be a new national campaign to raise awareness of patient safety issues, and that the government would be investing Â£20 million in research to improve patient safety. For many women who have been affected by vaginal mesh implants, the government's apology and promises of action come as a welcome step forward. However, they will be watching closely to see if these promises are fulfilled, and if the necessary changes are made to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.

Donegal crash: Mullan family funeral hears there are 'no words and no answers',"By Keiron Tourish, BBC News NI The small church in Donegal was filled to capacity as the Mullan family came together to say their final goodbyes. The tragic loss of John Mullan, 49, his six-year-old daughter Amelia, and 14-year-old stepson Tomas had left a void in the hearts of those who knew them. Their mother, Geraldine Mullan, managed to escape the horrific crash that claimed their lives, but the trauma of that day continued to haunt her. As the mourners filed in, the sombre atmosphere was palpable. The pews were filled with tears and quiet sobs, while the scent of roses and lilies filled the air. The mourners included friends, family, and members of the local community, all gathered to pay their respects and offer their condolences. The funeral mass began with prayers and hymns, providing a sense of comfort and solace to those present. The celebrant spoke of the lives lost, and the love and memories that would remain in the hearts of those who knew them. He reminded the congregation that although there may be no words and no answers to explain the senseless tragedy, faith and love would carry the family through this difficult time. John Mullan was remembered as a kind and gentle man, who had a passion for the outdoors. He was a devoted father to Amelia and stepfather to Tomas, always putting their needs before his own. His friends spoke of his sense of humour and his ability to light up any room with his presence. Amelia was remembered as a bright, inquisitive and loving little girl, who brought joy to all those around her. Her favourite colour was pink, and she loved to dance and sing. Her teachers spoke of her enthusiasm and her infectious smile. Tomas was described as a caring and thoughtful young man, who was always there to lend a helping hand. He had a love of football and was a talented player. His coaches spoke of his sportsmanship and his dedication. As the mass came to an end, the mourners filed out of the church, some to the cemetery for the burial, and others to the Mullan family home for refreshments. The sun began to peek through the clouds, casting a gentle light on the mourners as they made their way to their cars. Although the loss was immeasurable, the love and support of the community provided some comfort to Geraldine and her family. The words of the celebrant rang true, that although there may be no words and no answers to explain the senseless tragedy, faith and love would carry them through. The Mullan family would never forget the love and memories they shared with John, Amelia, and Tomas, and their lives would forever be enriched by their presence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: West Midlands universities plan lockdown lectures,"The University of Wolverhampton and Keele University in Staffordshire have announced that teaching will continue online as the West Midlands region in England grapples with rising Covid-19 cases. However, students in some subjects will have to wait before they can resume their studies in person or attend practical sessions. At the University of Wolverhampton, students studying healthcare courses have been told that they will need to attend campus for face-to-face learning and practical sessions, but only if it is essential. The university has emphasised that such students will be contacted directly to arrange their attendance. A spokesperson for the University of Wolverhampton said: ""The health and well-being of our students and staff remains our top priority. We are working closely with Public Health England and other local partners to ensure that we are taking all necessary measures to protect our community."" Meanwhile, at Keele University, students on courses such as agriculture, biomedical sciences, and engineering have been advised that they may need to attend campus for practical work. The university has assured students that it will provide as much notice as possible before asking them to attend in person. A spokesperson for Keele University said: ""We understand that this is a challenging time for our students, and we will do everything we can to support them. We will be providing regular updates on our website and through our student communication channels."" Other universities in the West Midlands region, including Coventry University and the University of Birmingham, have also announced that teaching will continue online, with some exceptions for practical work or other essential face-to-face sessions. The news comes as the West Midlands region sees a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, with some areas experiencing infection rates higher than those seen during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in the spring. The region's mayor, Andy Street, has urged people to follow government guidelines and take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. The announcement of online-only teaching at West Midlands universities follows similar moves by universities across the country, including those in London and the North East. Some universities have also announced that they will be offering students the option to study entirely online for the rest of the academic year, in response to the ongoing pandemic. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, universities in the West Midlands remain committed to providing a high-quality education to their students, with many offering a range of online resources and support services to help students adapt to the new way of learning. University leaders have urged students to continue engaging with their studies and to make use of the resources available to them, both online and on campus.

Cladding: MPs fail in bid to change fire safety payment rules,"The Fire Safety Bill, which aims to strengthen regulations following the Grenfell Tower fire, was passed in the House of Commons this week. The bill comes after financial help was granted to building owners to install better cladding and other fire safety measures. However, flat owners affected by the dangerous aluminum composite material (ACM) cladding have expressed disappointment and frustration that they still face significant costs to make their homes safe. During a debate on the bill on Monday, Labour MPs attempted to amend the legislation to ensure that leaseholders would not be required to pay for the removal and replacement of ACM cladding, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The government argued that the amendment would put an unfair burden on taxpayers and that leaseholders should contribute to the cost of making their buildings safe where they could. The issue of who should bear the cost of removing and replacing dangerous cladding has been a contentious issue since the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in which 72 people lost their lives. The disaster exposed the widespread use of ACM cladding on high-rise buildings across the UK, many of which were owned by private landlords and housing associations. The government's Building Safety Fund, which was established to help building owners pay for the removal and replacement of ACM cladding, has been criticized for being underfunded and for having stringent eligibility criteria. Many leaseholders have been left facing massive bills to pay for the work themselves, with some facing bankruptcy as a result. In response to the controversy, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick announced a new Â£3.5 billion funding package last year to help cover the costs of removing and replacing dangerous cladding. However, critics argue that the package does not go far enough and that the government should be doing more to help leaseholders who are facing financial hardship. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) has called on the government to provide more financial support to leaseholders, arguing that it is not fair for them to bear the brunt of the costs of making their buildings safe. The NRLA has also called for the introduction of a national register of private landlords to help ensure that they are meeting their legal obligations regarding fire safety. The issue of cladding safety is not going away anytime soon, and it is clear that more needs to be done to protect leaseholders from the financial burden of making their buildings safe. The Fire Safety Bill is a step in the right direction, but it is essential that the government continues to invest in measures to ensure that all buildings are safe and that leaseholders are not left facing insurmountable debts. In conclusion, the passing of the Fire Safety Bill in the House of Commons this week is a welcome step towards strengthening fire safety regulations in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster. However, the issue of who should bear the cost of removing and replacing dangerous cladding remains unresolved, with many leaseholders continuing to face",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Manchester attack: Veil of quiet respect descends over city,"By Tom Mullen, BBC News Online The vigil in Albert Square, Manchester, on Tuesday night was a powerful display of unity and defiance in the face of tragedy. Thousands gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert and to show their support for the city. But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, the streets of Manchester were quiet once more. The sound of sirens had given way to the gentle hum of traffic, and the vibrant colours of the city centre were replaced by a sombre palette. Dozens of people could be seen huddled around the makeshift memorials that had sprung up in the square. They came to read the notes of condolence and to lay flowers, their faces solemn and thoughtful. The mood was one of deep sadness and reflection. The shock of the previous night had given way to a sense of loss and grief. But there was also a determination not to be cowed by the terrorists, a resolve to carry on in the face of adversity. Manchester's resilience was on display as shops and cafes opened their doors, offering free tea and coffee to those who needed a moment of comfort. The city's iconic landmarks, including the Town Hall and the Cathedral, were bathed in the soft glow of the sun, serving as symbols of hope and strength. But the sense of calm was not to last. Later in the day, the news broke of a second arrest in connection with the attack. The news spread like wildfire, casting a dark shadow over the city once again. The attack on Monday night had shattered the peace of Manchester, a city known for its vibrant culture and diversity. But the people of Manchester were not about to let terror win.

But even as the darkness descended, there was a sense that Manchester would rise again, stronger and more determined than ever before.

BT signs 5G deal with Ericsson to help ditch Huawei,"By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor BT, one of the UK's leading telecommunications providers, has signed a major 5G deal with Ericsson, as it looks to reduce its reliance on Huawei technology. The agreement, which was announced on Tuesday, will see Ericsson supply BT with equipment for the rollout of the next-generation mobile network, with the Swedish firm becoming BT's primary 5G vendor. BT said in time it expected 50% of all its 5G traffic to be transmitted via Ericsson's network gear. The move comes as the UK government prepares to impose stricter rules on the use of Huawei equipment in the country's telecoms networks. It follows a decision by the US to place the Chinese firm on a trade blacklist over national security concerns. Huawei has consistently denied any allegations of espionage and has accused the US of trying to limit its commercial success. BT's decision to partner more closely with Ericsson marks a significant shift in the company's strategy. Until now, Huawei had been a key supplier of equipment for both BT's 4G and 5G networks. However, the UK telecoms giant has been under pressure from the government to reduce its reliance on Chinese equipment, following the US's crackdown on Huawei. The deal with Ericsson covers the supply of radio access network (RAN) kit, which is used to transmit and receive wireless signals between mobile devices and the core network. BT said that Ericsson's equipment would be used to build out 5G coverage in a number of major UK cities, including London, Manchester and Birmingham. The company did not disclose the financial details of the deal, but it is understood that it will run for several years and could be worth billions of pounds. BT said that it would continue to use Huawei equipment in some parts of its network, but it was unclear how much of the Chinese firm's gear would remain in place. The company said that it was working closely with the government to ensure that its networks remained secure and that it was making good progress towards meeting its targets for the removal of Huawei equipment. In a statement, BT's chief technology officer, Howard Watson, said: ""We're delighted to have Ericsson as our primary 5G RAN vendor. Their technology is at the forefront of 5G and will help us deliver a step change in connectivity for our customers."" Ericsson's UK and Ireland head, Arun Bansal, added: ""We're committed to supporting BT in its mission to deliver high-performing and reliable networks for its customers."" The deal comes just weeks after BT's mobile arm, EE, signed a similar agreement with Nokia, which will see the Finnish firm become",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ex-Celtic Boys Club coach 'touched player's thigh in car',"The witness, who played for Celtic Boys Club in the 1980s, took the stand at the High Court in Glasgow and recalled an incident involving the accused, Mr Torbett. Mr Torbett, 71, denies sexually abusing four boys between 1975 and 1984. The witness described how one day, Mr Torbett picked him up from his home to take him to training. During the journey in Mr Torbett's car, the witness alleged that Mr Torbett touched his thigh in an inappropriate manner. ""I was sitting in the front seat next to him, and as we were driving, he started touching my thigh,"" the witness testified. ""I was shocked and didn't know what to do. I didn't say anything, and I just tried to move away from him as much as possible."" The witness stated that the incident lasted for a few minutes before Mr Torbett stopped and dropped him off at the training ground. The witness added that he never reported the incident at the time, as he was afraid of Mr Torbett and didn't want to cause trouble. The prosecution called several other witnesses who corroborated the allegations against Mr Torbett. One witness testified that he was also touched inappropriately by Mr Torbett during a car journey. Another witness described how Mr Torbett would make inappropriate comments and gestures towards the boys during training sessions. Mr Torbett's defence team questioned the witnesses, and some of them admitted that they had not reported the incidents at the time. The defence suggested that the allegations were false and motivated by financial gain, as several of the witnesses were seeking compensation from Mr Torbett. The trial continues, and the jury will need to consider the evidence presented by both sides before reaching a verdict. The allegations against Mr Torbett are seriously disturbing, and if proven, will have significant consequences for him and the Celtic Boys Club. Meanwhile, Celtic Football Club has issued a statement expressing their ""deepest sympathies to anyone who has been affected by historical abuse."" The club added that they were ""cooperating fully with the police and other authorities in their investigations."" The trial is a reminder of the importance of reporting any form of abuse or misconduct, no matter how long ago it may have occurred. It is crucial that anyone who has been affected by such incidents comes forward and seeks support, so that those responsible can be held accountable and victims can receive justice.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Chevron: Indigenous Ecuadoreans seek higher damages,"By Irene Caselli, BBC News, Ecuador A triumphant atmosphere might have been expected as they gathered for a news conference in Quito, given the favourable verdict finally reached in a case that had been going on more than 17 years. But the mood was far from celebratory as representatives of the indigenous communities affected by Chevron's oil operations in Ecuador addressed the media. Instead, they expressed disappointment and frustration with the fine imposed on the US oil company, which they consider a mere drop in the ocean given the devastating environmental and health consequences they have suffered. The $9.5bn (Â£7.3bn) damages awarded by a court in Lago Agrio in 2011 were reduced earlier this year to $965m by an appeal court in New York, a decision that was welcomed by Chevron. The company had previously been ordered to pay the entire amount to thousands of indigenous people and farmers for contamination caused by its oil operations in the Amazon rainforest between 1964 and 1990. In a statement, Chevron said it was pleased with the decision and accused the claimants of ""misrepresenting facts"" and ""manipulating the legal process"". The company has maintained throughout the lengthy legal battle that it had fulfilled its environmental obligations and that any contamination was the result of actions taken by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001. But for the indigenous communities, the verdict was a bitter pill to swallow. ""This is not justice for us, this is not enough,"" said Luis Yanza, a leader of the affected communities. ""We have been fighting for so long for our rights, for our land, for our health. This decision does not recognise the suffering and the harm we have endured."" The case has a long and complex history. In 1993, the indigenous communities and farmers filed a lawsuit against Chevron for alleged contamination of their land and water, resulting in health problems. The case was originally heard in Ecuador and resulted in the $9.5bn damages award. But Chevron refused to pay and the case went to the US, where the company argued that the original judgment was the result of corruption and coercion. The company also claimed that the plaintiffs had not provided enough evidence to support their claims. The decision by the New York appeal court to reduce the damages has been welcomed by Chevron, but the indigenous communities and their lawyers have vowed to continue their fight. They plan to appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court and have also initiated legal proceedings in Canada and Brazil. For the communities affected by Chevron's oil operations, the legal battle is far from over. The fight for justice and compensation for the harm caused to their land, their health, and their way of life continues. And as they",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China morning round-up: Illegal workers,"Shanghai Daily reported on Wednesday that Vice-Minister of Public Security Yang Huanning addressed the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, announcing a renewed crackdown on illegal workers in China. Yang stated, ""We will intensify efforts to improve visa policies and strengthen border controls to prevent the entry of illegal workers."" People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, further elaborated on the issue, saying that the current situation of illegal labor in China is a significant challenge to social stability and economic development. The paper reported that as of the end of 2020, there were approximately 10 million undocumented migrant workers in China, many of whom are employed in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. The South China Morning Post added that the crackdown will target not only illegal workers but also those who employ them. The paper reported that the government will increase fines for employers who hire undocumented workers and enhance cooperation with other countries to prevent the entry of illegal labor. Xinhua News Agency stated that the crackdown will be implemented in a coordinated manner, with various departments working together to address the issue. The report emphasized the importance of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of legal workers while ensuring that the labor market remains fair and orderly. China Daily noted that the crackdown comes at a time when the Chinese economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper stated that the government is taking action to ensure that the recovery is sustainable and that the labor market remains stable. Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid, criticized the attitude of some foreign media outlets towards China's labor policies. The paper stated that the media's portrayal of China as a country that exploits cheap labor is not only unfair but also inaccurate. The paper argued that the Chinese government is taking steps to improve labor conditions and protect workers' rights. The China Youth Daily emphasized the importance of education and training for young people in the face of increasing competition in the labor market. The paper reported that the government will invest more resources in vocational education and training programs to help young people acquire the skills they need to find good jobs. In conclusion, the Chinese government's renewed crackdown on illegal workers is a significant development in China's labor market. The crackdown will target not only undocumented workers but also those who employ them, with a focus on improving visa policies and strengthening border controls. The government's actions come at a time when the Chinese economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is a renewed focus on ensuring that the labor market remains fair and orderly. The Chinese media emphasized the importance of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of legal workers while ensuring that the labor market remains competitive and dynamic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'I'm gay and I was sexually assaulted by a woman',"By Shiona McCallum, Newsbeat reporter The film-maker, who prefers to remain anonymous, is a 32-year-old gay man. He says he ""didn't feel under threat"" by his attacker, Cheryl Cottrell, because she was a woman. But the incident, which took place in a bar in Manchester, has left him with long-lasting psychological damage. ""I was feeling quite vulnerable that night,"" he recalls. ""I'd had a few drinks and was on my own. Cheryl approached me and started making inappropriate comments. I tried to move away but she followed me, touching me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable."" The film-maker explains that he was frozen with fear. ""I didn't want to make a scene or draw attention to myself. I didn't want to be seen as 'weak' or 'vulnerable'. I've always been used to being the one in control, the one who protects himself. But in that moment, I felt powerless."" The incident occurred over a year ago, but the film-maker is still struggling with the aftermath. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and is receiving therapy for suicidal thoughts. ""I can't sleep properly. I wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares. I'm constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I feel like I can't trust anyone."" The film-maker's experience is not unique. According to a report by the National Centre for Domestic Abuse, around one in five victims of sexual assault are male. And yet, there is a misconception that sexual assault is a crime primarily committed against women. This can make it difficult for men to come forward and report incidents. ""I didn't tell anyone about what happened for a long time,"" the film-maker says. ""I was ashamed and embarrassed. I thought people would judge me or question my masculinity. But eventually, I realized that it wasn't my fault. I didn't deserve to be assaulted, regardless of my gender or sexuality."" The film-maker is now speaking out in the hope that his story will encourage other men to come forward. ""I want people to know that it's okay to feel vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to speak out, no matter who the perpetrator is."" The police are investigating the incident and Cheryl Cottrell has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. The film-maker is now focusing on his recovery and is working with a therapist to help him overcome his trauma. ""I know it will take time, but I'm determined to get better,"" he says.

Brexit: Giant lorry park branded 'concrete monstrosity',"Construction work on a site off the M20 near Ashford, Kent, began earlier this month, sparking controversy amongst local residents. The planned development, which includes a giant lorry park to facilitate customs checks post-Brexit, has been met with strong opposition. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed her disappointment and frustration at the lack of communication from local authorities and the Department for Transport. ""I had no idea this was even on the cards,"" she said. ""I only found out when I saw the construction vehicles arriving. It's sneaky, and it's not what I moved to this area for."" The plans for the lorry park were first announced back in 2018, but since then there has been a lack of information regarding the exact location and size of the facility. Some residents have raised concerns about the potential impact on the environment, with one local councillor describing the plans as a ""concrete monstrosity."" The Department for Transport has defended the project, stating that it is a necessary commercial development to ensure the smooth flow of goods in and out of the UK post-Brexit. In a statement, a spokesperson said, ""The Ashford site will provide much-needed capacity for HGVs and will help to reduce the need for heavy goods vehicles to travel through London and the South East. This will help to improve air quality and reduce congestion in these areas."" However, critics argue that the government could have chosen a different location for the lorry park, one that is less visually intrusive and has less of an impact on local residents. ""Why couldn't they have built this thing somewhere out of sight, like in an industrial estate or on an old airfield?"" asked one local resident. ""Instead, they've chosen to plonk it down right next to our homes. It's not on."" Despite the concerns of local residents, the Department for Transport remains committed to the project. The lorry park is expected to be operational by the end of the year, with the government investing Â£100 million in the development. As construction continues, tensions between local residents and the government are likely to remain high. Some residents have vowed to continue their opposition to the plans, with a petition against the lorry park already gathering hundreds of signatures. Only time will tell if the government will listen to their concerns and find a solution that is more palatable to the local community. In the meantime, the construction work continues apace, with heavy machinery and diggers tearing up the land. For many residents, it feels like an unwelcome intrusion into their community, a reminder of the political divisions that continue to plague the UK. As Brexit negotiations continue, it remains to be seen how the lorry park will fit into the bigger picture.

Preston GP struck off over 'dishonest' food poisoning claims,"A tribunal held at the Medical Practice Tribunal Service in Manchester this week found the actions of Dr Zuber Bux, who practised in the Preston area of Lancashire, to be ""misleading, dishonest, and financially motivated."" The panel, which comprised of a legally qualified chair and two lay members, also proved that Dr Bux failed to declare his wife, Sehana Bux, as a partner in his medical practice. The hearing followed allegations that Dr Bux had submitted false claims for food poisoning incidents to NHS Lancashire CCG between 2016 and 2018. It was claimed that the incidents, purportedly affecting patients at his practice, were fabricated, and the GP had submitted the claims to secure additional income. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel upheld several charges against Dr Bux, including making false claims, failing to maintain accurate records, and failing to act in the best interest of his patients. The panel further found that Dr Bux's actions had put patients at risk, as resources were diverted to investigating false claims rather than providing necessary treatment. The false claims, totalling approximately Â£11,000, were submitted to the CCG under the Global Summaries Contract, which rewards GPs for meeting certain contractual targets. The tribunal found that Dr Bux had intentionally submitted the claims, despite knowing they were false, to secure additional income for his practice. Dr Bux admitted to the allegations during the hearing but contested the severity of his actions. However, the panel determined that his actions were aggravated by his failure to declare his wife as a partner in the practice. This omission was found to be in breach of both the NHS Contract and the GMC's Good Medical Practice. The consequences of the tribunal's decision are severe. Dr Zuber Bux has been struck off the Medical Register, meaning he can no longer practise medicine in the UK. The panel's decision was based on the seriousness of the offences and the risk they posed to patient safety. NHS England, in response to the tribunal's decision, stated that they would take steps to recover the false claims paid to Dr Bux's practice. They further emphasised their commitment to maintaining the highest standards in the NHS and ensuring that patient safety remains a priority. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of honesty and integrity in the medical profession. The actions of Dr Bux not only breached professional guidelines but also put patients at risk and diverted resources away from essential healthcare services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Teletubbies creator 'sad' about show's remake,"Wood, 77, expressed her disappointment in the recent trend of remaking classic children's shows during an interview with Radio Times. ""I'm a bit sad,"" she shared. ""It comes down to the fact that these shows are being reimagined, sometimes unnecessarily, and the original essence and magic is lost in the process."" Teletubbies, which Wood created and produced, first aired in 1997 and captivated audiences with its surreal and colorful world. The show, which featured four lovable and curious creatures, quickly became a global sensation and a staple of British children's television. ""Teletubbies was a labor of love for me and my team,"" Wood reflected. ""We put so much thought and care into each episode, ensuring that the show was not only entertaining but also educational. It's disheartening to see the show being rebooted without the same level of dedication and creativity."" Wood expressed her concern that the remake may not resonate with the same audience that fell in love with the original. ""Teletubbies was a product of its time, and it captured the imaginations of a generation,"" she explained. ""I worry that a remake may not be able to replicate that same magic and may not connect with children in the same way."" Despite her reservations, Wood acknowledged that the entertainment industry is constantly evolving and that remakes are a part of that process. ""I understand that audiences crave new and innovative content, and I respect the decision to remake shows,"" she said. ""But I also believe that there is value in preserving the classics and allowing future generations to experience them in their original form."" Wood's words serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving the past while embracing the future. As the children's media landscape continues to evolve, it's essential to remember the shows that captured our imaginations and left a lasting impact on our childhoods. ""Teletubbies will always hold a special place in my heart, and I'll always be proud of the role it played in shaping the world of children's television,"" Wood concluded. ""I hope that future generations will have the opportunity to experience the show in its original form and that it continues to inspire and entertain for years to come.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Depression: 'Second biggest cause of disability' in world,"By Helen Briggs, BBC News The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Clinical depression ranks as the second biggest contributor to disability worldwide, according to the analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. The study, led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, found that depression accounts for 11.3% of all years lived with disability (YLDs) - a measure of ill-health and disability. This was second only to lower back pain which accounted for 13.5% of YLDs. The findings underline the need for more investment in mental health services, say the researchers. Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience low mood, loss of interest or pleasure, and a lack of energy. It can also lead to a range of physical and emotional problems. Lead author Dr. Prabhat Jha, from IHME, said: ""The burden of depression is enormous and it's growing as populations age and people live longer with chronic diseases. ""It's important that governments and health systems recognise this and prioritise mental health in their policies and budgets."" The study found that depression was a leading cause of disability in high-income countries, where it accounted for 14.3% of all YLDs, and in low- and middle-income countries, where it accounted for 10.6%. The researchers also looked at the impact of depression on productivity and the economy. They estimated that the disease led to 31.1 billion days of lost productivity worldwide in 2017. Professor Alessio Agostini, from IHME, said: ""These findings demonstrate the immense personal, social and economic costs of depression. ""It affects people of all ages, income levels, and regions. Addressing the burden of depression requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, treatment, and care."" The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as a major priority for action, and has set a target for countries to increase their capacity to diagnose and treat depression by 2030. Professor Ala Alwan, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health, said: ""These new estimates underline the urgent need for countries to invest in mental health services to ensure that people with depression get the care they need.

Nick Clegg 'appalled' by former school head master's abuse,"Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, expressed his deep shock and disappointment upon learning about the conviction of his former school headmaster for child abuse. Roland Peter Wright, 83, of Crown Lane, Farnham Royal, was found guilty of abusing five boys aged between eight and eleven at the prestigious St Peter's School in Guildford, Surrey, where Clegg was a pupil in the late 1970s. The abuses reportedly took place between 1975 and 1982. Clegg, who served as the leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2007 to 2014, released a statement on Monday, expressing his disbelief at the news and offering his support to those affected by the abuse. ""I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the conviction of Roland Peter Wright for the abuse of children at St Peter's School,"" Clegg said in a statement. ""My thoughts are with those who were victims of this reprehensible behaviour and I offer them my full support and sympathy."" The former deputy prime minister went on to express his gratitude for those who had come forward to report the abuse and for the work of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in bringing Wright to justice. ""I want to express my gratitude to those who had the courage to come forward and report these terrible crimes,"" Clegg continued. ""I also want to praise the police and the Crown Prosecution Service for their tenacity and professionalism in investigating this case and securing a conviction."" The news of Wright's conviction comes after a number of high-profile cases of child abuse in the United Kingdom, including the scandal surrounding the Jimmy Savile case, in which it was revealed that the late TV personality had abused hundreds of children over several decades. Clegg's statement drew widespread praise from former classmates and colleagues, who expressed their support for the former deputy prime minister and offered their own condolences to those affected by the abuse. One former classmate, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that they were ""shocked and saddened"" by the news and that they hoped that those affected would find ""some measure of closure and justice"" in the conviction of Wright. Another former classmate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that they had ""fond memories"" of their time at St Peter's School but that the news of the abuse had ""cast a dark shadow"" over those memories. The Liberal Democrats also released a statement, expressing their support for Clegg and offering their condolences to those affected by the abuse.

Pound rises on Brexit 'progress' report,"Sterling rose nearly 1% against the US currency and 0.5% against the euro after the reports on Bloomberg News suggesting that the UK and EU were making progress in their Brexit negotiations. However, the gains were short-lived as investors remained cautious, aware that significant hurdles still needed to be overcome before a deal could be reached. The reports indicated that the EU had offered the UK a possible deal based on the Northern Ireland backstop being removed in exchange for the UK aligning more closely with EU rules in areas such as agriculture and industrial goods. This proposal was seen as a potential breakthrough in the negotiations, which have been deadlocked for months. However, the details of the offer were not yet clear, and both sides still had significant differences to resolve. The Irish border issue remained a major sticking point, with the EU insisting on a backstop to prevent a hard border, while the UK rejected what it saw as an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty. Furthermore, there were concerns that even if a deal were reached, it may not be ratified by the UK parliament, which has rejected previous agreements. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a difficult task in selling any deal to MPs, many of whom were deeply opposed to the backstop and unwilling to accept any perceived loss of sovereignty. Despite these challenges, the news of potential progress in the negotiations was enough to boost the pound, which had been under pressure in recent weeks due to uncertainty over the Brexit negotiations and the global economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, the gains were limited, with many investors holding back from making large bets on the pound until there was more clarity on the details of any deal and its chances of being ratified. The euro also gained against the dollar, with the single currency benefiting from renewed optimism over the EU's economic recovery and the European Central Bank's stimulus measures. Overall, the reports of progress in the Brexit negotiations provided a welcome boost to the pound, but the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations and their outcome continued to limit the currency's gains. The coming days and weeks were likely to bring further twists and turns in the Brexit saga, with significant implications for the UK, the EU, and the global economy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Europe-wide police operation busts horsemeat racket,"In a coordinated Europe-wide operation, Spanish police have cracked down on a major horsemeat racket, arresting 65 individuals and seizing hundreds of horses. The suspects, who were apprehended in multiple raids across the regions of Valencia and Murcia, are accused of various crimes including animal abuse, forgery, money laundering, and racketeering. The investigation, which involved law enforcement agencies from several European countries, uncovered a vast network of illegal horse slaughterhouses and processing plants. Horses in Portugal and Spain, deemed unfit for consumption due to illness or injury, were transported across borders and slaughtered in clandestine facilities. The meat was then processed and labeled as beef or other types of meat, with fraudulent documentation to deceive consumers and regulators. The operation, which began in January 2023, was named ""Equine Protection."" It is the latest in a series of efforts to combat the illegal horsemeat trade in Europe, which has gained notoriety in recent years for its scale and complexity. The practice, which is estimated to involve thousands of horses annually, is not only a welfare concern but also poses a significant risk to public health due to the potential for contaminated meat to enter the food supply chain. The seizure of the horses, which took place at various locations in Spain, marks the largest single action against the horsemeat trade in the country's history. The animals, many of which were found in poor condition, are being cared for by animal welfare organizations and will be rehabilitated before being rehomed. The arrests were made following a complex investigation that involved undercover officers, informants, and the analysis of vast amounts of data. The suspects are believed to have links to organized crime groups and to have operated the racket for several years, evading detection through a web of false documents and identity fraud. The European Commission, which has been working closely with member states to tackle the issue, welcomed the operation as a significant step forward in the fight against the illegal horsemeat trade. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) emphasized the importance of maintaining strict controls on the production and distribution of animal-derived foods to protect public health and ensure consumer confidence. As the investigation continues, authorities are working to determine the full extent of the network and identify any additional suspects or accomplices. They are also working to trace the origin of the horses and the distribution of the illegal meat. The operation is expected to send a clear message to those involved in the horsemeat trade that such criminal activities will not be tolerated and will be met with the full force of the law. The illegal horsemeat trade is not just a problem for Europe. It is a global issue that affects many countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The trade is driven by demand for cheap meat and a lack of enforcement and regulation. It is a complex issue that requires a coord",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
London minicab drivers demand more Covid-19 protection,"London's 110,000 minicab drivers have been permitted to continue working during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, providing essential journeys for Londoners. However, concerns over the lack of adequate protection measures have been raised by the United Private Hire Drivers Association (UPHD), leading to demands for urgent action from Transport for London (TFL). Six London minicab drivers had recently tested positive for Covid-19, prompting the UPHD to call on TFL to provide clear guidance on how to minimise the risk of catching the virus while on duty. In an open letter to TFL commissioner Mike Brown, UPHD general secretary Jim Kelly stressed the need for immediate action, stating that, ""Our members are putting themselves and their families at risk every time they get behind the wheel."" The UPHD has outlined several key measures that they believe will help to protect minicab drivers, including the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks and gloves. They have also called for the introduction of contactless payments and the installation of partitions in vehicles to create a physical barrier between drivers and passengers. However, the UPHD's pleas have so far fallen on deaf ears, with TFL maintaining that it is the responsibility of individual drivers and operators to ensure that they are following government guidelines on social distancing and hygiene. In response to this, the UPHD has threatened to take industrial action, with Kelly warning that, ""If TFL do not address our concerns, we will have no choice but to consider further action to protect our members."" The pandemic has already had a significant impact on the minicab industry, with many drivers reporting a significant drop in fares due to reduced demand. The UPHD has called on the government to provide financial support to drivers, arguing that they are essential workers who deserve to be treated fairly during these difficult times. Despite the challenges, many minicab drivers have continued to provide a vital service to Londoners, transporting key workers to and from their places of work and helping to keep the city moving. However, without adequate protection measures in place, there is a risk that the virus could continue to spread among the minicab driver community, potentially leading to further disruption and hardship. As the situation evolves, it is clear that urgent action is needed to ensure that London's minicab drivers are given the support and protection they need to continue providing essential journeys while keeping themselves and their families safe. The UPHD's calls for PPE, contactless payments, and partitions in vehicles are a reasonable response to the current crisis, and it is hoped that TFL will listen to their concerns and take decisive action to address them. In the meantime, minicab drivers are being urged to follow government guidelines on social distancing and hygiene, and to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves while on duty. This includes wearing masks,",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: What are UK health officials saying?,"Hugh Pym, Health editor @BBCHughPym @Twitter Working closely with his counterparts in the devolved administrations, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, plays a central role in planning the UK's response to Covid-19. An infectious disease expert by training, Professor Whitty brings a clinical perspective to the government's efforts to combat the virus. In a recent press conference, Prof Whitty addressed the current state of the pandemic in the UK and what the public can expect in the coming weeks. He began by acknowledging the progress made in the vaccination programme, stating that ""it's very clear that the vaccines are making a difference to hospitalisations and deaths."" However, he also warned that the number of daily Covid-19 cases is still high and urged caution as the country enters a new phase of the pandemic. ""We're not at the end of this yet,"" he said. ""We've still got a significant number of cases and therefore a significant risk of transmission."" Prof Whitty encouraged the public to continue following the guidelines to suppress the virus, including social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and working from home where possible. He also emphasised the importance of getting tested if they develop symptoms or are contacted by Test and Trace. On the subject of international travel, Prof Whitty advised against non-essential journeys and urged those returning to the UK to follow the quarantine rules. ""The risk of importing the virus is still there,"" he said. ""It's important that we don't lose sight of the fact that we've made a lot of progress and we don't want to jeopardise that."" When asked about the possibility of further restrictions, Prof Whitty said that the government would take a ""cautious and gradual"" approach. ""We've got to be careful about imposing measures that have a big impact on people's lives,"" he said. ""But if we see a significant increase in transmission, we'll have to consider what further measures we might need to take."" In the meantime, Prof Whitty urged the public to remain vigilant and continue following the guidelines to protect themselves and others. ""We're all in this together,"" he said. ""The more we can do to reduce transmission, the quicker we'll be able to move towards a more normal way of life."" As the UK continues to navigate its way through the pandemic, the role of figures like Prof Chris Whitty in providing clear and accurate information to the public cannot be overstated.

Commons pays tribute to miners in Gleision tragedy,"Shadow Welsh Secretary and Neath MP Peter Hain addressed the Commons with solemnity, his voice echoing the collective mourning that had gripped the nation following the tragic events at the Gleision Colliery in South Wales. He began by expressing his deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the three miners who had lost their lives in the catastrophic coal fire that had engulfed the mine on February 16th. ""We pay tribute to those miners, Yvonne Fletcher, Philip Hill and David Powell, who tragically lost their lives in the Gleision Colliery disaster,"" Hain said, his words heavy with emotion.

""We must act now to ensure that all mines are equipped with the latest safety measures and that all workers are adequately trained to deal with any emergency situations,"" Hain said. ""We must also ensure that there is robust regulatory oversight of the mining industry, with effective enforcement action taken where necessary."" Hain also acknowledged the role that the mining community itself played in preventing accidents and ensuring the safety of its workers. He urged mineworkers and their unions to continue their efforts to promote safety and to report any concerns they may have to the authorities. ""The mining community has a vital role to play in preventing accidents and ensuring the safety of its workers,"" Hain said. ""I call on mineworkers and their unions to continue their efforts to promote safety and to report any concerns they may have to the authorities."" As Hain concluded his speech, he reiterated his commitment to working with the mining industry, the unions and the government to ensure that the lessons from the Gleision tragedy were learned and that steps were taken to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Sheffield shooting: Drive-by gunman guilty of attempted murder,"The boy suffered serious leg injuries when Stephen Dunford, 25, opened fire on a group of people in Northern Avenue, Sheffield, from a passing car. He was one of three individuals targeted in the brazen daylight attack on 12 July 2021. Dunford, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of attempted murder and three counts of possessing a firearm with intent to cause harm after a trial at Sheffield Crown Court. The jury reached its verdict on 14 December following a week-long trial. The court heard that Dunford and another man, who is still at large, arrived at the scene in a grey Vauxhall Corsa. They stopped the car in the middle of the road, and Dunford, wearing a scarf and gloves, fired multiple shots at the group of people, who had been gathered outside a property. The boy, who was just 18 years old, was struck in the leg. Another man, aged 22, was hit in the leg and arm, and a 27-year-old woman was also injured in the leg. All three victims were taken to hospital for treatment, with the woman's injuries being described as serious but not life-threatening. Detective Inspector Steve Ridgway, of South Yorkshire Police, praised the bravery of the victims and their quick thinking in getting themselves and others to safety. He also thanked the local community for their support during the investigation. ""This was a serious attack on three innocent people, which could so easily have resulted in far more harm,"" DI Ridgway said. ""Our priority was to ensure those injured received the best possible care and support, and we're pleased to see that they are all making progress in their recovery."" Dunford was arrested on 13 July, just one day after the shooting, following a police appeal for information. He was charged the following day and remanded in custody. The judge, Recorder Nicholas Lyons QC, imposed an extended sentence, meaning Dunford will serve a minimum of five years in prison before being eligible for parole. He was also banned from owning or possessing any firearms for life. In a statement, the victims' families welcomed the guilty verdict, expressing their relief that justice had been served. ""We're pleased that Stephen Dunford has been found guilty of these terrible crimes,"" the statement read. ""Our thoughts remain with the victims and their families, who continue to deal with the physical and emotional scars of this attack."" As Dunford was led away to begin his prison sentence, the community of Northern Avenue was left to reflect on the violence that had disrupted their lives. However, they remained resilient, vowing to come together to tackle the issue of gun crime in their area. ""We won't let this define us,"" one local resident said.

A killer's compulsion undimmed by time,"By Graeme Ogston, BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter Sobs from the public seats, a cacophony of grief and disbelief, echoed through the courtroom as the convicted killer took his seat. The packed press area hung onto every word as the judge began to read out the sentence that would, once again, change lives forever. The man in the dock, now a frail, elderly figure, had taken the lives of three young people over four decades ago. Time had not dimmed his compulsion to kill, and as the sentence was announced, the victims' families were left to ponder the cruel irony that the passage of years had not tempered his malevolent intent. The courtroom was a place where the rawest emotions were laid bare, where the echoes of past crimes and the promise of future justice collided in a maelstrom of human emotion. And in this crucible of pain and loss, the story of this killer's compulsion played out once more. As the trial unfolded, the bitter details of the crimes were recounted. The victims, all young and full of promise, had been lured to their deaths by a man who had disguised himself as a figure of trust and authority. Their hopes and dreams had been snuffed out in an instant, leaving behind a trail of devastation that had lasted for decades. But this was not just a story of crime and punishment. It was also a story of resilience and survival. For the victims' families, the trial was an opportunity to bear witness to the injustice that had been done to their loved ones, and to demand that the man who had caused them so much pain be held accountable. As they listened to the evidence and the legal arguments, they clung to the hope that justice would be served, and that the passage of time would not diminish the importance of their loved ones' memories. And as the verdict was delivered, they let out a collective sigh of relief, knowing that the long wait for justice was finally over. But even as the trial came to a close, there was no denying that the specter of this killer's compulsion would linger. For the families, the knowledge that the man who had caused them so much pain was still alive, still in the world, was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the devastating impact that one moment of violence can have on a family and a community. As the courtroom emptied and the reporters packed up their equipment, the families were left to face the long road to healing, knowing that the memories of their loved ones would never fade, but that the passage of time would, eventually, allow them to find a measure of peace.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Labour's prosperity pledges for election campaign,"Carwyn Jones, the Welsh Labour leader, outlined six election pledges aimed at promoting prosperity and enhancing the quality of life for the people of Wales. Speaking at a campaign event, Jones emphasized the importance of delivering improved school standards, a new NHS treatment fund, and 100,000 apprenticeships. Improved school standards will be at the heart of Labour's education policy. Jones pledged to work towards ensuring every child in Wales attains a good level of primary school literacy and numeracy. To achieve this goal, Labour will invest in teacher training, provide schools with the resources they need, and implement an ambitious and inclusive curriculum. The new NHS treatment fund is another key pledge, with a commitment to securing additional and long-term funding for the health service. This investment will allow for quicker access to diagnostic tests, more modern equipment, and cutting-edge treatments. Jones highlighted the importance of a well-funded NHS, ensuring that everyone in Wales can receive the care they need, when they need it. The promise of 100,000 apprenticeships is aimed at addressing the skills gap and providing young people with the opportunity to gain valuable on-the-job experience. By working with businesses, Welsh Labour will create a wide range of apprenticeships across various industries, offering young people a real alternative to university. Additionally, Carwyn Jones announced free childcare for all three and four-year-olds, as well as two-year-olds from low-income families. This policy will provide a much-needed boost to working families, enabling them to balance their careers and family life more effectively. Lastly, Labour will offer help for older people selling their homes. Jones acknowledged the difficulties that elderly homeowners face when downsizing and pledged to introduce a new system to make the process simpler and less stressful. This will include providing access to professional advice, support with legal and administrative matters, and the option to defer payment of stamp duty land tax. In summary, Carwyn Jones outlined a comprehensive set of six election pledges designed to promote prosperity and improve people's lives in Wales. With a focus on education, healthcare, and job creation, Labour's proposals aim to address the pressing needs of the population while also providing long-term benefits for the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ulster Bank apologises as thousands unable to access money,"It apologised for Monday evening's problems and assured its customers that it was working to resolve the issues as soon as possible. Ulster Bank, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) group, acknowledged the inconvenience caused to up to 750,000 customers who were unable to use cash machines, debit cards, or access online or telephone banking services. The bank explained that the cause of the disruption was a ""technical issue"" and that its teams were working round the clock to restore normal service. In a statement, Ulster Bank said, ""We're really sorry for the inconvenience caused to our customers today. We understand how important it is for our customers to be able to access their money, and we're working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."" Customers took to social media to vent their frustration and share their experiences. Some reported being unable to pay for essentials such as fuel and groceries, while others were left stranded without access to their funds to pay for public transport or hotel bills. One customer, speaking to the BBC, said, ""I've been trying to get cash out all day, but all the machines are down. I've got no money left and I need to pay for my train fare home. This is unacceptable."" Another customer, who had been unable to make online payments for bills, added, ""I've missed a few payments now, and I don't know when I'll be able to catch up. This is a disaster, and I'm really worried about the impact on my credit rating."" Ulster Bank responded by confirming that it would compensate any customers left out of pocket as a result of the disruption. In the statement, the bank said, ""We'll make sure that any customers who've been left out of pocket as a result of today's issues will be compensated. We'll be in contact with those customers directly."" The bank's assurance came as welcome news to some customers, but others remained sceptical.

Indonesia crash: Sriwijaya Air plane's flight data recorder retrieved,"The flight data recorder from the wreckage of Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182 was brought ashore on Tuesday, providing investigators with crucial information in their search for answers regarding the tragic crash that occurred just a day earlier. The Boeing 737-500 plane, which was en route from Jakarta to Pontianak in Indonesia, plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff, leaving all 62 passengers and crew members on board dead. The authorities are hoping that data from the black boxes can give vital clues on the possible cause of the crash. The flight data recorder, also known as the digital flight data recorder (DFDR), records various parameters of the aircraft's performance, including altitude, airspeed, engine data, and other critical flight information. This data could help investigators piece together the sequence of events leading up to the crash. However, the search for the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which records conversations between the pilots and air traffic control, is still ongoing. The CVR could provide valuable insights into the pilots' actions and conversations in the moments leading up to the crash. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, the CVR is believed to be located in the tail section of the plane, which is still submerged in the sea. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) and the Indonesian Air Force have deployed a team of experts and specialized equipment to search for the CVR. The search is being conducted in challenging conditions, with strong currents and poor visibility making the task difficult. Investigators are also examining other evidence, such as debris from the wreckage and witness statements, to help piece together the puzzle of the crash. Preliminary reports suggest that there were no signs of engine trouble before the plane plunged into the sea. However, further analysis of the data from the flight recorder may reveal other factors that contributed to the tragedy. The crash of Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182 is a tragic reminder of the importance of aviation safety, and the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash will be closely watched by aviation experts and the families of the victims. The search for the cockpit voice recorder continues, and investigators remain hopeful that the data from both black boxes will provide valuable insights into the cause of the crash. As the investigation continues, the aviation industry and the public will be watching closely to see what lessons can be learned from this tragic incident, and how they can be applied to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. The aviation community has expressed its condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the crash, and reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring the highest standards of safety in aviation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Victims' Code criticised by watchdog,"Parliamentary Ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor expressed her concerns on Monday, stating that investigations into complaints made against public bodies had revealed a notable lack of understanding when it came to the Victims' Code. She made these remarks as ministers revealed their plans to overhaul the code in an effort to provide better support to victims of crime. In her annual report, Dame Julie highlighted the need for public bodies to understand the significance of the Victims' Code and their responsibilities towards victims of crime. She noted that while the majority of public bodies were complying with the code, there were still instances where this was not the case. The Victims' Code sets out the level of service that victims of crime can expect from criminal justice agencies. It was introduced in 2013 to ensure that victims are treated with fairness, respect, and consistency throughout the criminal justice process. However, Dame Julie's report suggested that some public bodies were not fully grasping the implications of the code and were falling short in their duties towards victims. The watchdog's criticism came as Home Secretary Priti Patel announced plans to reform the Victims' Code, with a focus on ensuring that victims of crime receive the support they need and are kept informed throughout the criminal justice process. Ms Patel emphasized the importance of putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system and ensuring that they are not left in the dark about the progress of their cases. The proposed reforms include measures to strengthen victims' rights to information and communication, as well as providing greater support for victims of complex cases such as domestic abuse and sexual violence. The government also intends to introduce a new Victims' Law, which will place a legal duty on public authorities to ensure that victims are provided with appropriate information and support. Dame Julie welcomed the government's plans to reform the Victims' Code, stating that it was essential that public bodies fully understood their responsibilities towards victims of crime. She emphasized the need for a cultural shift within the criminal justice system, with a renewed focus on putting victims at the center of the process. The parliamentary ombudsman's report served as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that victims of crime receive the support they need and are treated with dignity and respect throughout the criminal justice process. With the government's proposed reforms, there is hope that progress will be made in this area and that victims will no longer be overlooked or forgotten. However, it is crucial that these reforms are not just empty promises, but rather are implemented in a meaningful and effective way. Only then can we ensure that victims of crime receive the support they deserve and that their voices are heard. It is the responsibility of all public bodies to uphold the Victims' Code and to put the needs of victims at the forefront of their actions. The time for change is now, and it is essential that we seize this opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of victims",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"'Affluence is factor' in tests, says 11-plus council","By Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter Buckinghamshire County Council has reiterated that affluence plays a significant role in 11-plus test results, following a warning to a school seeking to use the exams to admit a more diverse student body. Highcrest Academy in Chesham was advised by the council against using 11-plus results as the sole criteria for entry, after the school expressed a wish to widen its intake and better represent the local community. The council's stance on the issue came to light in a report published by the Times Educational Supplement (TES), which revealed that Highcrest Academy had been warned against such a move due to the potential impact on less affluent pupils. In response to the TES article, Buckinghamshire County Council issued a statement confirming its position on the use of 11-plus exams for secondary school admissions. ""Buckinghamshire County Council acknowledges that affluence can be a significant factor in 11-plus test results,"" the statement read. ""We believe that it is important to ensure that the admissions process for our selective schools is fair and transparent for all children, regardless of their socio-economic background."" The council went on to explain that it has implemented measures to help mitigate the impact of affluence on test results, including providing additional support for pupils in areas of need and offering free 11-plus tuition to those who cannot afford it. However, the council also acknowledged that more needs to be done to address the issue of socio-economic inequality in education. ""We recognise that there are wider issues around socio-economic inequality that need to be addressed,"" the statement continued. ""That's why we are working closely with schools and community organisations to provide additional support and resources to help level the playing field for all children."" The debate around the use of 11-plus exams for secondary school admissions has been a contentious issue in Buckinghamshire for many years. Critics argue that the exams unfairly advantage children from more affluent backgrounds, who are often able to afford private tuition and other resources that give them an edge. Supporters of the exams argue that they provide a fair and objective means of assessing a child's academic ability, and that they are an important part of the selection process for selective schools. The issue is not unique to Buckinghamshire, with similar debates taking place in other areas of the country that use 11-plus exams for secondary school admissions. As the debate continues, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that all children have an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background. Whether that means rethinking the admissions process, or investing in additional support and resources for disadvantaged pupils, it is a challenge that requires a comprehensive",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

WGPSN's scope of work includes the operational management of drilling and production facilities, as well as the execution of maintenance and modification projects. The company's technical expertise will also be crucial in optimizing the performance of Nexen's assets and identifying opportunities for cost savings.

The company has been working with Nexen since 2012 and has helped the Canadian oil and gas company to achieve record levels of production. ""We are delighted to have been awarded a new contract with Nexen, which builds on our long-standing relationship and our successful track record of delivering operational excellence,"" said Robin Watson, Wood Group's Chief Executive. ""Our team on the North Sea continues to demonstrate its expertise and commitment to delivering safe and reliable operations for our customers."" The contract extension is a welcome boost for Wood Group, which has faced challenges in recent years due to the downturn in the oil and gas industry. The company has undergone a major restructuring program, which has involved the sale of non-core assets and the streamlining of its operations. Despite the challenges, Wood Group remains committed to the North Sea, which continues to be an important source of oil and gas for Europe. The company's expertise in operations, maintenance, and technical support is in high demand, and it is well-positioned to benefit from the expected recovery in the North Sea market. The new contract is also a sign of confidence in the North Sea as a whole, which has faced uncertainty in recent years due to the low oil price and the ongoing Brexit negotiations. The UK government has announced a number of measures to support the industry, including tax incentives and a new regulatory framework, and there are signs that investment is beginning to pick up. WGPSN's new contract with Nexen is a reminder of the important role that the North Sea continues to play in the global energy market, and the crucial contribution that companies like Wood Group make to ensuring its safe and efficient production.

Milk cuts campaign launched by Scottish farmers,"It comes after Robert Wiseman, Britain's biggest fresh milk company, announced that it would reduce the farm-gate milk price by 1.7p a litre, effective from 1 August. Wiseman blamed the decision on rising production costs and the impact of the pandemic on the hospitality industry. The news has sparked anger among Scottish farmers, who are now calling for action to support the dairy sector. The National Farmers Union of Scotland (NFUS) has launched a campaign, urging consumers to buy local milk and dairy products to help maintain the income of farmers affected by the milk price cuts. NFUS President, Martin Hawkins, said, ""The dairy sector is facing unprecedented challenges, and this latest announcement from Wiseman is a blow to many farm businesses. We understand that there are pressures on milk processors, but it is crucial that they engage with farmers and work collaboratively to find solutions that ensure a fair and sustainable supply chain."" The campaign, which is being backed by retailers, processors, and food industry bodies, aims to raise awareness of the importance of the dairy sector to the Scottish economy and to encourage consumers to choose locally sourced milk and dairy products. NFUS is also calling on the Scottish Government to provide additional support to farmers and to engage in discussions with milk processors and retailers to find a long-term solution to the milk price issue. The Scottish milk industry employs around 2,500 farmers and contributes around Â£1 billion to the economy each year. However, many farmers have been struggling with low milk prices for several years, and the pandemic has added to their financial woes. The NFUS campaign comes as the Scottish Government is considering plans to introduce a voluntary code of practice for the dairy sector to improve transparency and fairness in the milk supply chain. The code would require processors and retailers to provide more information to farmers about milk prices and payments, and to engage in consultations with farmers before making any significant changes to milk prices. The NFUS campaign is just the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at supporting the dairy sector in Scotland. In May, the Scottish Government announced a Â£12 million funding package to help dairy farmers affected by the pandemic. The package includes grants for farmers to invest in on-farm infrastructure and to improve productivity, as well as financial support for those who have been unable to sell their milk due to the closure of the hospitality industry. Despite the challenges facing the dairy sector, many farmers remain optimistic about the future. ""We are committed to producing high-quality milk and dairy products, and we believe that there is a growing demand for local, sustainable food,"" said Hawkins. ""We urge consumers to support us by buying local milk and dairy products and to encourage their local retailers and processors to engage with farmers and work together to ensure a fair and sustainable supply chain.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Children in care 'let down for too long', says David Cameron","Writing in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his deep concern over the plight of children in care, stating that they have been let down for far too long. He pledged ""zero tolerance"" towards state failure in the area of social care and announced plans for a new covenant to support those leaving care. The PM acknowledged the heart-wrenching stories of children growing up in care, often facing numerous challenges and obstacles that make it difficult for them to thrive and succeed in life. He emphasized that every child deserves the best possible start in life, regardless of their background or circumstances. To address this issue, Cameron announced new laws that will encourage the permanent adoption of children, even when there are complex legal issues involved. He emphasized that every child deserves a loving and stable home, and that the state has a responsibility to ensure that this is provided for them. The PM also highlighted the need for better support for those leaving care, recognizing that the transition to independent adulthood can be a difficult and challenging time. He announced plans for a new covenant, which will provide additional support and resources to help young people make a successful transition to adulthood. Cameron acknowledged that there is no easy solution to the complex issues surrounding children in care, but he is determined to make a difference. He called on everyone to work together to ensure that children in care receive the support and care they need to thrive and succeed in life. The PM's announcement was welcomed by charities and campaigners, who have long called for greater support and resources for children in care and those leaving care. They praised the government's commitment to addressing this issue and welcomed the new laws and initiatives announced by the PM. However, some have raised concerns about the practical implementation of the new laws and initiatives, and the resources required to make a real difference in the lives of children in care. They have called for greater investment in social care and a more holistic approach to supporting children and young people. Despite these challenges, the PM remains determined to make a difference in the lives of children in care. He recognizes that this is a long-term challenge that will require a sustained effort from government, charities, and society as a whole. But he is confident that with a zero-tolerance approach to state failure and a new covenant for those leaving care, we can make a real difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable children in our society. In conclusion, the Prime Minister's pledge to children in care is a welcome acknowledgement of the challenges they face and a commitment to making a difference in their lives. With new laws encouraging permanent adoption and a new covenant for those leaving care, there is a glimmer of hope for a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable children in our society.

Rickmansworth man Davey Everson jailed for Millie-Rose Burdett murder,"At the Old Bailey Criminal Court in London, Davey Everson, 23, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 21 years for the murder of three-month-old Millie-Rose Burdett. The heartbroken family and friends of the infant girl filled the public gallery, some weeping as the judge delivered the sentence. Judge Mark Lucraft QC described the attack on Millie-Rose as ""unjustifiable and cruel."" The court heard that Millie-Rose had suffered 31 separate injuries, including rib fractures, head injuries, and a brain hemorrhage. The prosecution argued that Everson had subjected the innocent baby to a campaign of cruelty that ultimately led to her death. As the details of Millie-Rose's injuries were read out in court, Everson remained emotionless, showing no remorse for his actions. The judge noted that ""there was no sign of any medical intervention to alleviate Millie-Rose's suffering or to save her life."" The lack of medical attention, the judge added, was ""a clear indication of the defendant's callous disregard for the baby's welfare."" The court was told that Millie-Rose's mother, Jessie Burdett, had briefly left her with Everson while she went out to work. When she returned, she found her daughter unresponsive and called emergency services. Millie-Rose was rushed to hospital, where she died two days later. During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Everson had a history of violence against children. He had previously been cautioned for assaulting a six-year-old girl and throwing a one-year-old child to the ground. The defense argued that Everson had a borderline personality disorder and was not in control of his actions when he harmed Millie-Rose. However, the judge rejected this argument, stating that Everson had chosen to bring Millie-Rose into his home and was therefore responsible for her care. As the sentence was passed, Millie-Rose's family and friends reacted with a mix of relief and sadness. They had finally received some closure, but at a terrible cost. The loss of a young life, taken so brutally and needlessly, left them feeling shattered. The judge concluded by expressing his condolences to the family and friends of Millie-Rose. ""I cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering you have endured,"" he said. ""I hope that the knowledge that the defendant will spend a significant period in prison for his crimes may bring some small comfort to you all."" As Everson was led away to begin his sentence, the courtroom emptied, leaving behind a somber reminder of the fragility of young life and the cruelty that can be inflicted",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Lockdown 'could boost wild flowers',"By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst Plantlife has been urging councils for years to cut grass less often. It also wants them to delay cutting until flowers have had a chance to seed. The charity says this would help boost wildflowers and support bees and other pollinators. Now, as the UK is in lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, there are signs that the call for less frequent grass cutting is having some impact. The absence of mowing has given many verges and roadside areas a chance to bloom. The charity's chief executive, Sue Roberts, said: ""We've been campaigning for years to get councils to adopt a more relaxed approach to grass cutting. And now, suddenly, it seems to be happening. It's a great thing for wildlife."" Ms Roberts said that many councils had told her they were unable to carry out grass cutting due to lockdown restrictions. She added that some were even considering cutting back on their use of herbicides, which would benefit not just wildflowers, but also other plants that are often mistakenly targeted. The absence of regular grass cutting has led to a veritable explosion of wildflowers in some areas. Dandelions, buttercups, red clover, and many other species have all been spotted blooming in abundance. And as these flowers die back, they will leave behind seedheads that will provide food for birds in the autumn. But the benefits aren't just for wildflowers. The absence of mowing has also given bees and other pollinators a chance to thrive. For example, common spotted orchids, which are dependent on a specific type of bee for pollination, have been seen in increasing numbers in some areas. Ms Roberts said that the absence of mowing was also having a positive impact on people's mental health. ""Seeing wildflowers in bloom is a real tonic for many people, especially during these difficult times,"" she said. ""It's a reminder that nature is still here, and that we can make a difference by taking small steps to help it thrive."" Of course, not all councils have been able to reduce their grass cutting activities. Those with roads that are particularly busy or prone to accidents have had to continue with regular mowing to maintain safety. But even in these areas, there are signs that the absence of mowing is having an impact. For example, some councils have been leaving strips of verge unmown near busy roads, to provide a haven for wildflowers and pollinators. Ms Roberts said that she hoped that the current situation would lead to a permanent change in attitudes towards grass cutting. ""We've seen that it's possible to reduce the frequency of mowing without causing any real problems,"" she said. ""And the benefits for wildlife, and for people, are clear. I hope that coun",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Newspaper headlines: 'Midsummer's dream' and '118 days until freedom',"By BBC NewsStaff ""Four steps to freedom,"" the i declares, outlining a roadmap for leaving lockdown restrictions behind. The optimistic tone stands in contrast to the Daily Telegraph's more sombre ""118 days until freedom,"" a reminder of the long wait ahead before life fully returns to normal. The i's article focuses on the government's proposed plan to ease restrictions, with a focus on four key areas: vaccines, schools, work, and social contact. The piece offers a glimmer of hope that, with the continued success of the vaccination rollout, the end of lockdown could be within reach. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph's headline underscores the frustration felt by many as they continue to grapple with the challenges of life in lockdown. With no clear end in sight, the number of days until freedom serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices being made. Elsewhere, the Guardian urges readers to ""Take heart: spring is here and so is hope,"" highlighting the signs of renewal and growth that are beginning to emerge as the seasons change. The article focuses on the positive effects of nature on mental health and wellbeing, encouraging readers to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days to boost their spirits. The Financial Times, ever focused on business and economics, turns its attention to the impact of the pandemic on the world's largest companies. The paper reports on the latest earnings reports and trends, offering insights into how companies are faring in these uncertain times.

Merseyside Police arrest footage reveals 'nothing short of an assault',"Merseyside Police have released arrest footage that has raised concerns over the use of force during the detainment of a gym owner in Liverpool. The video, which was obtained by the BBC, appears to show Nathan De Asha, owner of the Prophecy Performance Centre gym, being kicked while being held for alleged Covid-19 breaches. The footage, which lasts for around 30 seconds, shows several police officers manually restraining De Asha on the ground, with one officer repeatedly kicking him in the leg. De Asha can be heard shouting and pleading with the officers to let him go. Vinny Tomlinson, a witness to the incident, told the BBC that he believed De Asha had been subjected to ""nothing short of assault."" Tomlinson, who filmed the incident on his mobile phone, said that he had seen the gym owner comply with the officers' instructions before being arrested and taken to the ground. ""He didn't resist at all. He was just trying to explain what was going on. I couldn't believe what I was seeing,"" Tomlinson said. ""I've seen a lot of things in my time, but that was the most shocking thing I've ever seen the police do."" The Merseyside Police have defended the actions of their officers, stating that they had attended the scene in response to reports of a large gathering at the gym, which was in breach of Covid-19 regulations. In a statement, the force said that De Asha had ""failed to comply with the officers' lawful instructions,"" and that the use of force was ""proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances."" Tomlinson, however, disagrees, and has called for an independent investigation into the incident. ""The police have got to hold themselves to a higher standard,"" he said. ""This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it can't continue. People have had enough."" The incident comes at a time when tensions between the public and the police have been heightened due to the ongoing pandemic and the various restrictions that have been put in place. Many have criticized the heavy-handed approach of some officers in enforcing the regulations, with some accusing them of using excessive force. The use of force by police officers is a complex issue, and there are often differing opinions on what is considered to be reasonable and necessary in any given situation. However, in this case, the footage speaks for itself, and it is clear that De Asha was subjected to a significant degree of force, which has left many people questioning the actions of the officers involved. The Merseyside Police have promised a thorough investigation into the incident, and it remains to be seen what the findings will be. In the meantime, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in policing, and the need for officers to exercise restraint and proportionality when dealing",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Moira Stuart to join Classic FM,"She has been at the BBC for over 40 years, having briefly left in 2007 over what was perceived as an ageism row. Stuart, the esteemed broadcaster, is known for her distinguished voice and impeccable delivery, which has graced the airwaves of the British Broadcasting Corporation for decades. Now, Moira Stuart is set to make her return to the media landscape, this time as a presenter on Classic FM. The announcement was made with much fanfare, as news of Stuart's new role spread like wildfire through the media and among her legions of loyal fans. Classic FM, the UK's most popular classical music radio station, is no stranger to high-profile presenters. But the addition of Moira Stuart to their roster is undoubtedly a coup for the station. Her extensive experience in broadcasting, coupled with her passion for classical music, is sure to draw in a large and engaged audience. Stuart's career at the BBC spanned over four decades, during which she presented some of the most high-profile news programmes on the corporation. Her tenure included stints on BBC One's News at Ten, Breakfast Time, and Six O'Clock News. She also presented the BBC Two programme, Newsnight, and was a regular presenter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, her departure from the BBC in 2007 was not an amicable one. Stuart, who was then in her late 50s, was reportedly offered a new contract with reduced hours and a lower salary, which she saw as an ageist move. The controversy surrounding her departure generated widespread media attention and public sympathy, with many seeing her as a victim of age discrimination. But now, Moira Stuart is looking forward to a new chapter in her career. Speaking about her new role at Classic FM, she said, ""I am absolutely thrilled to be joining Classic FM. I have always loved classical music, and I am really looking forward to sharing my passion with listeners.

Scot back in police custody in India over fresh claims,"Jagtar Singh Johal, 30, has been in custody for a fortnight in Jalandhar, India, following his arrest on 4 November on allegations of being involved in a series of shootings that left several people dead. However, his legal team and human rights groups claim that he is a innocent man and that the charges against him are fabricated. On Friday morning, Johal appeared before a judge at a local court for a remand hearing. The hearing came just days after new evidence emerged that allegedly implicates him in another incident of violence in the Punjab region. According to reports, the evidence includes CCTV footage that purportedly shows Johal at the scene of the crime. Despite these new allegations, Johal's lawyers argued that their client was being subjected to a campaign of harassment and that the evidence against him was flimsy at best. They also claimed that the investigation into the shootings was biased and that the police had failed to follow due process. However, the prosecution argued that there was sufficient evidence to keep Johal in custody while the investigation continued. They also pointed to his previous convictions, which included charges of possession of illegal weapons. The judge ultimately sided with the prosecution and ordered Johal to be remanded in custody until 30 November. Johal's lawyers have indicated that they will be appealing the decision and have called for an independent investigation into the allegations against their client. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the UK-based Sikh Federation, have expressed concern over the case and have called for the Indian authorities to ensure that Johal receives a fair trial. They have also urged the UK government to provide consular assistance to Johal and to raise the issue with the Indian authorities. Johal's family, who live in the UK, have described the situation as ""traumatic"" and have called for his immediate release. They have also accused the Indian authorities of targeting Sikhs and of using false evidence to frame innocent people. The case has echoes of the controversial arrest and subsequent detention of two other Sikhs, Amritpal Singh and Gurdeep Singh, in the same region in 2017. Both men were held on allegations of involvement in militant activity and were released after several months in detention following international pressure. Jagtar Singh Johal's case has once again highlighted the tensions between India and the UK over human rights issues and has raised concerns about the treatment of minority communities in India.

Stonehaven evacuation amid flooding fears,"In the quaint coastal town of Stonehaven, Scotland, the tranquility was disrupted by the relentless onslaught of heavy rain and rough sea conditions. The normally serene beach area was transformed into a chaotic scene as floodwaters inundated the area, leaving residents in a state of alarm. The water, which had accumulated from the heavy rain, merged with the turbulent sea, creating a formidable force that threatened to engulf the town. The town's harbor, a popular tourist destination, was particularly hard-hit, with the waves crashing against the harbor walls, sending plumes of spray into the air. The situation was made worse by the rising waters of the River North Esk, which threatened to overflow its banks. Elsewhere, an elderly man was forced to sought refuge from the rising waters, and was eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered above the town. The Local Authority, in response to the flooding, issued a number of flood warnings and appeals for residents to evacuate the affected areas. Schools were closed, and residents were advised to stay indoors and away from the windows to avoid the risk of injury from flying debris. Stonehaven's Emergency Services were kept busy, with reports of cars being stranded in flooded roads and power outages in some areas. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) urged residents to take the warnings seriously, and to follow the instructions of the Local Authority. ""The situation is very serious and we are urging people to take immediate action to protect themselves and their families,"" a spokesperson for the Local Authority said in a statement. ""We are working closely with our emergency services partners and SEPA to ensure that the response to this incident is as effective as possible."" The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for the area, with forecasters warning of further heavy rain and strong winds in the coming hours. The town's residents were urged to stay informed of the latest developments and to follow the instructions of their Local Authority and emergency services. The flooding in Stonehaven was a stark reminder of the unpredictable power of nature. As the town continued to battle the elements, the community came together to support each other, offering words of encouragement and practical help where they could. Despite the challenges, there was a sense of resilience and determination among the people of Stonehaven, as they worked to weather the storm and rebuild their town in the days and weeks to come. In the midst of the chaos, it was a reminder that in times of need, the importance of community and the strength of the human spirit cannot be underestimated. As the rain continued to pour down, the people of Stonehaven remained hopeful, knowing that together, they would get through this and rebuild stronger than ever before.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
South Africa funeral firm to sue pastor for 'resurrection stunt',"A viral video of Pastor Alph Lukau, a well-known South African pastor, has sparked controversy and outrage after he was seen performing what many are calling a ""resurrection stunt"" during a funeral service. In the video, which has since gone viral on social media, Pastor Lukau is seen shouting ""rise up"" to a man lying down in a coffin. The man, dressed in a suit and wearing a hat, then jerks and sits up, leaving many in the crowd cheering and praising the pastor. However, not everyone is impressed by the pastor's actions. The family of the man in the coffin have reportedly expressed their disappointment and anger over the stunt, stating that they had specifically requested a private funeral and had not given permission for the pastor to perform any miracles or demonstrations. The funeral home where the service was held, Duduza Memorial Park, has also announced that they will be taking legal action against Pastor Lukau for breach of contract and defamation. The funeral home's managing director, Thulani Mdluli, stated that ""the resurrection stunt was not part of the agreement we had with the family and it has tarnished our reputation. We cannot have our business associated with such things."" The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has also weighed in on the matter, expressing their concern over the pastor's actions and calling for a ""restraint of sensationalism and the respect of human dignity, especially in times of grief."" The SACC went on to state that ""the actions of Pastor Lukau are not only disrespectful to the deceased and the grieving family, but also to the wider Christian community."" Pastor Lukau, who is the leader of Alleluia Ministries International, has defended his actions, stating that ""this is not a stunt, but a genuine act of God. The man in the coffin was indeed dead, but God brought him back to life in front of everyone."" However, many are calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the man's death and the resurrection claim. The incident has sparked widespread debate and controversy in South Africa, with some praising the pastor for his faith and others condemning him for exploiting a vulnerable situation for personal gain. The funeral home's decision to take legal action against the pastor is a rare move in South African religious circles, but it remains to be seen how the case will unfold and what the ultimate outcome will be. Regardless of one's views on the matter, it is clear that the incident has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the religious community, particularly when it comes to the handling of funerals and the treatment of the deceased and their families.

Prince William tours disaster-hit NZ and Australia,"He met rescue workers in Christchurch, where more than 160 people died in the earthquake, as he began his tour of disaster-stricken New Zealand and Australia. The prince, second in line to the British throne, was greeted with a warm reception as he arrived in the earthquake-ravaged city. Prince William, accompanied by his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was given a briefing on the ongoing rescue efforts and the extent of the damage caused by the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch on February 22. The couple expressed their deep sympathy to those affected by the disaster and assured them of the United Kingdom's support during this difficult time. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the Prince and the Duchess visited several areas of the city to assess the damage firsthand. They met with families who had lost their homes, volunteers, and emergency services personnel. The royal couple also took the time to speak with school children, who were given the day off due to the aftershocks. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge then traveled to Blenheim, New Zealand, where they visited the Marlborough Vintners' Association, tasting some of the region's famous wines. However, their visit was not all about pleasure, as they also took the opportunity to meet with those affected by the devastating February 2011 Canterbury earthquake. The couple then flew to Sydney, Australia, where they were met with a grand welcome. Prince William and Catherine visited the Taronga Zoo, where they were greeted by a variety of animals, including a koala named Diwani, who was named in their honor. The royal couple also met with injured soldiers and their families at the Sydney Hospital. Later in the day, they attended a reception at the Government House, where they met with prominent Australians from various fields. Prince William and Catherine also took part in a tree-planting ceremony in the historic Royal Botanic Garden as a symbol of hope and renewal. Throughout the tour, Prince William and Catherine have shown great compassion and understanding towards the people of New Zealand and Australia. Their visit has provided a much-needed morale boost for those affected by the disasters, and their presence has served as a reminder that they are not forgotten. The tour is set to continue, with the royal couple visiting other disaster-stricken areas in both countries. Their itinerary includes visits to schools, hospitals, and relief centers, and they are expected to meet with more volunteers, emergency services personnel, and those affected by the disasters.

Gloucestershire unitary authority plans 'nuts',"The idea of reorganizing Gloucestershire's local government into two unitary authorities has gained momentum, with leaders from Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, and the Cotswolds agreeing to initiate the process. The proposed plan aims to bring these districts under one council, while Gloucester, Stroud, and the Forest of Dean would form the other. The rationale behind this proposal is to streamline local government structures, reduce administrative costs, and provide more effective and efficient services to residents. Proponents argue that the current system of multiple district councils and a county council results in duplication of services and inefficient use of resources. The proposed reorganization has been met with mixed reactions from the public and local politicians. Some argue that the new structure could lead to a loss of local identity and representation, as smaller districts may feel overshadowed by larger ones. Others believe that the benefits of increased efficiency and cost savings outweigh any potential drawbacks. The leaders of the three districts involved in the proposed new authority have stated that they will work closely with their counterparts in the other districts to ensure a smooth transition. They have emphasized the importance of maintaining local services and representing the unique characteristics of each area. However, the plan is still in its infancy, and many details need to be worked out before it can be presented to the government for approval. The proposed new authorities would need to be given powers and funding equivalent to that of existing unitary authorities, and the process of transferring responsibilities and staff between the different tiers of local government would be complex. Gloucestershire County Council, which currently oversees the county's education, social services, and highways, has not yet taken a definitive stance on the proposal. Leader Mark Hawthorne has stated that the county council will ""consider the matter carefully,"" but has also expressed concerns about the potential impact on services and the cost of the reorganization. The proposal to reorganize Gloucestershire's local government is not without precedent. In 1997, the county was considered for merger with South Gloucestershire, but the plan was ultimately abandoned due to opposition from local politicians and residents. Since then, the county has undergone significant changes, with the creation of unitary authorities in Bath and North East Somerset and Wiltshire, leaving Gloucestershire as the only county in the region with a two-tier system. The decision to pursue this reorganization rests with the government, which will need to consider the potential benefits and costs before making a final decision. In the meantime, residents and local politicians will be watching closely to see how the proposal develops and what impact it may have on their communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Russians fly orphan bear to new life,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Villagers in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula found the starving 10-month-old brown bear cub roaming their freezing streets last month, crying out for food and help. When local volunteers managed to coax her into a cage with food, they were both relieved and confused. The bear, whom they named Masha, was clearly in distress, but her behavior was unlike anything they had seen before. The Russian Wildlife Protection Service was called, and after a thorough examination, it was determined that Masha had been orphaned. Her mother, most likely killed by poachers, had left her to fend for herself. The cub's plight tugged at the hearts of the local community, who couldn't bear to see her suffer. A decision was made to transport Masha to a wildlife sanctuary in the Ural Mountains, where she would be cared for and given the chance to live a normal life. But getting her there would not be an easy task. The journey would involve multiple flights and long drives through harsh winter conditions. Volunteers from the local wildlife protection group, WWF Russia, stepped up to help. They began the arduous process of preparing Masha for the journey. She was given a thorough medical examination, vaccinated, and given a sedative to keep her calm during the flights. Her cage was then loaded onto a small plane, along with a team of veterinarians and volunteers. The first leg of the journey was from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Khabarovsk, a flight that usually takes about three hours but was extended due to the need to make several stops to refuel in the extreme weather conditions. The team was relieved when they finally touched down in Khabarovsk, but they knew the journey was far from over. Masha's next leg of the journey was a long drive to the Ural Mountains, where the wildlife sanctuary was located. The team was met with more challenges, including treacherous roads and freezing temperatures. But their determination never wavered, and they finally arrived at the sanctuary late in the evening. Masha was carefully unloaded from her cage and taken to a special enclosure, where she was given food and water. The volunteers were overjoyed to see her eat heartily and finally show signs of relaxation. They knew that the road to recovery would be long, but they were confident that with the care and attention she would receive at the sanctuary, Masha would thrive. The journey to save Masha was a testament to the resilience and compassion of the Russian community. Despite the challenges they faced, they never gave up on the little bear cub. And in the end, their efforts paid off, as they gave her a chance at a new life.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Are farmers getting the mental health support they need?,"By Elaine Mitchell, BBC News NI But a charity which helps farmers and rural families in Northern Ireland says there's been a 25% increase in calls for mental health support during the past year. The Farming Life organisation, which provides counselling and advice, reports that the pressures of farming are taking a heavy toll on people's wellbeing. Farmers face numerous challenges, from unpredictable weather and volatile markets to long hours, financial stress, and isolation. Many have seen their incomes fall due to factors beyond their control, such as Brexit uncertainty and natural disasters. The Rural Support Network, another charity that offers mental health support, says the trend is not unique to Northern Ireland. Across the UK, farmers have reported increased anxiety and depression, with some even considering suicide. The situation is particularly concerning because farmers often struggle to ask for help. There's a stigma around mental health issues in rural communities, and many farmers feel they must be self-sufficient and able to cope with anything. This attitude can make it difficult for them to reach out for support when they need it most. To address this issue, Farming Life and other organisations have launched campaigns to raise awareness of mental health issues in farming communities. They're working to break down the stigma surrounding mental health and encourage farmers to seek help when they need it. The charities are also lobbying the government for more funding and resources to support farmers' mental health. They argue that investing in mental health services for farmers is not only the right thing to do morally, but it's also good for the economy. Research shows that poor mental health can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher healthcare costs. By supporting farmers' mental health, we can help ensure that they are able to continue working productively and sustainably. However, some critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of farmers' mental health issues. They point to the need for policies that support farmers financially, such as price guarantees and subsidies, and the need for more investment in rural infrastructure, such as broadband and transport. In the meantime, charities like Farming Life and the Rural Support Network continue to offer mental health support to farmers and rural families. They provide a range of services, from counselling and advice lines to support groups and training programmes. They also offer practical advice on issues like debt management and stress relief. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues, it's important to remember that help is available. You don't have to face these challenges alone. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for support. And remember, it's okay to ask for help. You're not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Extra testing in Pendle to stop virus spread,"The area in east Lancashire, specifically Pendle, has once again found itself in the spotlight as it was revealed that it was the second highest region in England for new coronavirus cases last week, according to the latest public health statistics. The news comes as a reminder that the virus is still very much present in our communities, and that vigilance and caution are necessary to prevent its spread. David Williams, the director of public health for Pendle Borough Council, acknowledged the concern that this news may bring to local residents. ""There is a cause for concern and we need to continue to be careful,"" he said in a statement. ""It is important that we all do our part to help prevent the spread of the virus and protect ourselves, our families, and our communities."" To address the rising number of cases, Pendle Borough Council has announced that it will be implementing additional testing in the area. The council is working with Lancashire County Council and the NHS to set up new testing sites, as well as increasing the capacity at existing sites. The additional testing is aimed at identifying cases as early as possible, so that those who test positive can self-isolate and prevent further transmission. It is also hoped that the testing will help to identify any clusters or hotspots of infection, allowing targeted interventions to be put in place. The council is also urging residents to take up the offer of testing, even if they do not have symptoms. ""Testing is a crucial tool in our fight against the virus,"" said David. ""It is important that we all get tested regularly, not just when we have symptoms. This will help us to identify cases that might otherwise go unnoticed, and prevent further transmission."" In addition to the testing, Pendle Borough Council is also urging residents to continue to follow the government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes maintaining social distancing, wearing masks in enclosed spaces, and washing hands regularly. David emphasized the importance of everyone working together to keep the community safe. ""We all have a role to play in preventing the spread of the virus,"" he said. ""By following the guidelines, getting tested regularly, and taking other precautions, we can all help to protect ourselves and those around us."" The situation in Pendle is a reminder that the fight against the coronavirus is far from over. While there have been some positive developments, such as the rollout of vaccines, it is important that we continue to take the threat seriously and do everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus. In the coming days and weeks, we can expect to see more testing and other interventions in Pendle and other areas with high infection rates. It is a difficult time, but by working together, we can get through it and emerge stronger and more resilient.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Norman Baker: EU would slow down 'legal highs' fight,"By Justin Parkinson, Political reporter, BBC News The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker has told a parliamentary committee that the European Union would slow down the UK's efforts to tackle new psychoactive substances, often referred to as legal highs. Mr Baker, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the UK was already in a ""stronger position"" than most states due to its flexibility to act quickly. He argued that the EU's complex regulatory system, which can take years to implement new laws, would hinder the UK's ability to ban new substances as they emerge on the market. Speaking at a committee hearing on the government's response to the Psychoactive Substances Act, which came into force in May 2016, Mr Baker said: ""We're much better off in the current position than we would be if we were in the European Union. The EU would slow us down."" The Psychoactive Substances Act outlawed so-called legal highs, which were sold legally but often had similar effects to illegal drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine. Mr Baker's comments come as the Home Office announced plans to ban a new psychoactive substance called 5-IT-ACO, which is believed to be responsible for a number of hospital admissions. The substance, also known as 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, or 5-MeO-DIPT, is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that can cause users to experience psychosis, paranoia and aggression. Mr Baker told the committee that the UK's exit from the EU would give the government more freedom to tackle new substances as they emerge. He said: ""I think Brexit will give us an opportunity to do things differently and to do them more quickly. We've seen how long it takes to get things done in the European Union. It can take years."" Mr Baker's remarks were backed up by other members of the committee, including Labour MP Steve Reed, who praised the government's approach to tackling new psychoactive substances. Mr Reed said: ""I think the government has done a good job in tackling new psychoactive substances. The act has been effective in reducing the number of substances on the market and the number of hospital admissions."" However, Mr Reed also warned that the government needed to do more to educate young people about the dangers of new psychoactive substances and to provide them with alternative activities. He said: ""We need to do more to prevent young people from getting involved in these substances in the first place. That means providing them with positive alternatives and making sure they're aware of the risks."" Mr Baker agreed, and called for more resources to be dedicated to preventing young people from using new psychoactive substances. ",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
British Legion calls for more research into Gulf War illnesses,"The British Legion, the UK's largest military charity, has called for more research into illnesses associated with the Gulf War, urging the government to increase funding for studies on the condition. Over 33,000 former soldiers are thought to suffer from various health issues related to their service, including chronic headaches, fatigue, memory problems, and neurological disorders. The charity, which provides financial, social, and emotional support to members of the armed forces community, expressed concern that too little is known about the condition and its causes. In a statement, the British Legion's Director General, Charles Byrne, said, ""It is vital that we understand the long-term health implications for those who served in the Gulf."" The Gulf War, which took place from 1990 to 1991, saw the deployment of over 46,000 British troops. At the time, they were exposed to a range of environmental hazards, including depleted uranium, chemical weapons, and oil fires. The health effects on veterans have been a subject of debate for decades. The British Legion's call for more research comes after a report by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) found that there was a ""consistent but small"" association between Gulf War service and a number of health conditions, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin disorders. The report, however, acknowledged that more research was needed to establish a causal link between Gulf War service and these conditions. The British Legion has long been campaigning for better support for Gulf War veterans. In 2018, it launched a major report, ""Forgotten Wounds: The Health Needs of Gulf War Veterans,"" which called for increased funding for research, better access to healthcare, and greater awareness of the health issues facing Gulf War veterans. The charity's call for more research has been welcomed by veterans' groups and medical professionals. Dr. Ann Macintyre, consultant neurologist and honorary professor of military neurology at the University of Birmingham, said, ""There is a need for more research into the health effects of Gulf War service, particularly into the long-term consequences of exposure to environmental hazards. The British Legion's call for more funding is an important step in addressing this gap in knowledge."" The Ministry of Defence has said that it is committed to supporting veterans and providing them with the best possible care. A spokesperson for the MoD said, ""We are committed to ensuring that all our veterans receive the care and support they deserve. We have a range of welfare and support measures in place, and we are constantly reviewing and improving them. We will continue to work closely with the British Legion and other veterans' organisations to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our armed forces community.""

Dale Farm eviction: 'Show of force designed to shock',"By Julian Sturdy, BBC East The police, the travellers were told, would only be there to maintain the peace and prevent criminality. But when they struck, the eviction operation was sudden and unexpected. This was not the gradual, ordered removal of Dale Farm travellers that had been promised, but a show of force designed to shock. At around 5am on Sunday, 10 October 2011, police officers, accompanied by bailiffs, descended on the illegal traveller site in Crays Hill, Essex. The operation, which involved up to 1,000 police officers, was seen as a significant test of the police's ability to deal with large-scale eviction operations. As dawn broke, the travellers, who had been warned of the impending operation, gathered at the site to resist. Women and children were among those who stood their ground, trying to prevent the removal of their caravans and belongings. Some threw bricks and other missiles at the police, while others used garden hoses to spray water in their direction. The police responded with riot shields and batons, using pepper spray and arresting dozens of people. The travellers, who had been given until midday to leave voluntarily, were given until 6pm to vacate the site permanently. The scenes of chaos and confrontation were captured by the media and broadcast around the world. The operation, which was estimated to cost taxpayers millions of pounds, was criticised by human rights groups and some politicians, who described it as heavy-handed and disproportionate. Essex Police defended the operation, saying that it was necessary to maintain law and order and to prevent further criminality. They also argued that the travellers had been given ample warning to leave voluntarily and that the operation was carried out with care and consideration for the welfare of those involved. The eviction of Dale Farm was a complex and controversial issue, with deep-rooted tensions between the traveller community and the local authorities. The site, which had been the subject of legal battles for years, was home to around 500 travellers, many of whom had lived there for decades. The eviction operation marked the end of an era for Dale Farm, and raised important questions about the rights of travellers, the role of the police in eviction operations, and the future of unauthorised traveller sites in the UK. It was a stark reminder of the challenges faced by both the traveller community and the authorities in managing the issue of unauthorised encampments. Despite the controversy and the cost, the eviction of Dale Farm was seen by some as a necessary step in maintaining law and order, while others viewed it as a tragic and unnecessary use of police resources. Whatever the outcome, the operation served as a powerful reminder of the complex and contentious nature of the issue of traveller sites, and the challenges faced by",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Venezuela ex-prosecutor: I have proof of Maduro corruption,"Luisa Ortega, the former prosecutor general of Venezuela, has made explosive claims of widespread corruption within the government of President Nicolas Maduro. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Ms Ortega provided detailed evidence of what she described as a ""web of illicit deals and bribes"" involving senior officials in the ruling United Socialist Party (PSUV). Ms Ortega, who fled Venezuela last week after she was sacked and her husband charged with extortion, presented documents and testimonies that she said prove the involvement of Maduro and two senior party leaders in corrupt practices. According to her, the President received millions of dollars in bribes from businessmen in exchange for protection and favours. The first of the accused party leaders is Diosdado Cabello, who currently serves as the president of the National Constituent Assembly. Ms Ortega claimed that Cabello had used his position to secure lucrative contracts for companies close to the government, in return for large sums of money. She also accused him of being involved in the embezzlement of public funds. The second accused is Fernando Ortega, no relation to the former prosecutor general, who is the current prosecutor general. Ortega accused him of being a ""puppet"" of Maduro and of covering up corruption cases involving the President and senior officials. She also claimed that Ortega had pressured her to drop investigations into several high-profile cases. Ms Ortega's allegations come at a critical time for Maduro, who is facing increasing pressure from opposition forces and the international community over his handling of the country's deepening economic crisis. The President has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights abuses, and his government has been widely criticised for its response to protests against his rule. The former prosecutor general's evidence includes documents that she said were obtained from the offices of the Prosecutor General's Office, as well as testimony from witnesses. She also provided details of bank transfers and other financial transactions that she said proved the involvement of Maduro and the accused party leaders in corrupt deals. Ms Ortega's claims have been met with scepticism by some, who have questioned the authenticity of the evidence and the motivations of the former prosecutor. However, her allegations have been welcomed by opposition figures and human rights groups, who have long accused the Maduro government of corruption and authoritarianism. The international community has also reacted with concern to Ms Ortega's claims. The United States and several European countries have called for an investigation into the allegations, and the Organisation of American States (OAS) has said that it is monitoring the situation closely. Despite the challenges facing her, Ms Ortega remains defiant. She has vowed to continue speaking out against what she describes as the ""corrupt and authoritarian regime"" in Venezuela, and has called on",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tesla's Elon Musk may be in contempt over tweet,"His comments came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the courts to hold Elon Musk in contempt for allegedly violating a settlement aimed at limiting his social media comments. The rule was imposed after he upset markets in 2018 with tweets about taking Tesla private at $420 a share, a price he claimed had been secured, but which ultimately proved to be without foundation. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has a history of making bold statements on his Twitter account that can move markets. In February 2019, he tweeted that Tesla would make around 500,000 vehicles in 2019, significantly more than the company's previous forecast of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles. The tweet caused Tesla's stock to surge, and the SEC began investigating whether Musk had violated the settlement. The SEC settlement, reached in October 2018, required Musk to have his future tweets about Tesla pre-approved by a securities lawyer or a designated corporate representative. The settlement was designed to prevent Musk from making market-moving statements without proper disclosure. However, in February 2019, Musk tweeted about Tesla's production numbers without getting the tweet pre-approved. The SEC argued that this violation of the settlement was deliberate and merited contempt proceedings. Musk's lawyers argued that the tweet was not material and did not contain any false or misleading statements. They also argued that Musk had not received a formal warning from Tesla or the SEC before the tweet was made. The contempt hearing came as Tesla faces other challenges. The company has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan, which is crucial to its profitability. The company also faces competition from rivals like Volkswagen and General Motors, which are investing heavily in electric vehicles. The SEC's action against Musk could have wider implications for other CEOs who use social media to communicate with investors. It could lead to more stringent regulations on social media use by corporate insiders, and could make it more difficult for companies to use social media as a tool for communicating with investors. The outcome of the contempt hearing could also have implications for Musk's personal reputation and his leadership of Tesla. Musk has been a polarizing figure in the business world, with some seeing him as a visionary entrepreneur and others as a reckless risk-taker. The SEC's action could fuel perceptions that Musk is a serial rule-breaker who puts his own interests ahead of those of his investors. Regardless of the outcome of the contempt proceedings, Musk's use of social media is likely to remain a topic of interest for investors and regulators.

Dundee University to tackle hepatitis in Tayside drug users,"Working alongside NHS Tayside, researchers at the University of Dundee are making strides in the fight against hepatitis C infections in Tayside's drug user community. The collaborative project, which is supported by the Scottish Government's Hepatitis C Elimination Programme, aims to reduce the number of new infections by targeting at-risk individuals at an early stage. The initiative comes as part of a larger effort to eliminate hepatitis C in Scotland by 2030. According to recent data, around 4,500 people in Tayside are living with the virus, with many of them unaware of their status. Drug use is a significant risk factor for hepatitis C transmission, making it a priority area for intervention. The research team, led by Professor Jane Dixon from the University of Dundee's School of Medicine, plans to use a harm reduction approach to engage with drug users. This approach, which prioritizes minimizing the negative consequences of drug use, has been shown to be effective in reducing the spread of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C. The project will involve outreach work in drug treatment settings and street-based work to connect with individuals who may not be engaged with healthcare services. The team will offer testing for hepatitis C and provide information and support for those who test positive. They will also offer vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, as well as connect individuals with addiction treatment services and other support networks. Professor Dixon explained, ""We know that many people who use drugs are at risk of hepatitis C infection, and that early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for preventing long-term liver damage. Our goal is to reach out to those who may not be engaged with healthcare services and offer them testing, support, and treatment."" The project will also involve training healthcare professionals on how to effectively engage with drug users and provide them with the necessary resources to prevent and treat hepatitis C. This will help ensure that those who do access healthcare services receive the best possible care. The University of Dundee's research builds on previous work by NHS Tayside, which has seen significant reductions in new HIV infections through similar harm reduction approaches. With the added resources and expertise of the University, the project is optimistic about making a meaningful impact on the number of hepatitis C infections in Tayside. Professor Dixon concluded, ""We are excited to be working with NHS Tayside on this project and to be contributing to the larger effort to eliminate hepatitis C in Scotland. By taking a harm reduction approach and engaging with drug users where they are, we hope to make a real difference in the lives of those who are most at risk.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cambridgeshire guided busway opens to passengers,"Buses will run between Huntingdon in the north of the county and Trumpington, just south of Cambridge, along the longest guided busway in the world. The route, which includes 13.3 miles (21.5km) of guided concrete track, is a testament to the innovative transportation solutions being implemented in the United Kingdom. The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, a Â£170 million project, is not just an ordinary bus route. It is a state-of-the-art infrastructure designed to offer a smoother, faster, and more efficient journey for passengers. The guided buses, which run on a concrete track with a guide rail, are expected to reduce journey times by up to 20 minutes compared to traditional buses. The busway, which was originally scheduled to open in 2005, has faced numerous delays and controversies due to various reasons, including cost overruns and environmental concerns. However, the project's supporters argue that the benefits of the busway far outweigh the challenges. The guided buses, which will operate every 10 minutes during peak hours, will provide a more reliable and consistent service for passengers. The busway's flat and straight track will also allow the buses to maintain higher speeds, reducing congestion on the roads and improving air quality. The busway is not just significant for the residents of Cambridgeshire. It is also an essential link in the wider transport network, connecting the region to the rest of the country. The busway is expected to reduce the number of cars on the roads, thereby reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality. The busway is also an essential part of the Cambridge Autonomous Metro project, which aims to introduce driverless buses on the route in the future. The project is expected to revolutionize public transportation in the region, offering a more convenient, efficient, and sustainable way of traveling. The opening of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway is a significant milestone in the world of public transportation. It marks a new era of innovation and efficiency in the delivery of public transport services. The busway is not just a transport infrastructure project; it is a commitment to a greener, more sustainable, and more efficient future. Passengers using the busway for the first time can expect a comfortable and smooth journey. The buses, which are equipped with low-floor facilities, are accessible to disabled passengers and those with mobility issues. The buses also offer ample seating, air conditioning, and real-time information systems to keep passengers informed. As buses embark on their maiden voyages along the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, passengers can look forward to a transport experience like no other.

The heartbreak of watching the slow death of ash trees,"Chris Jackson, Presenter, Inside Out, North East & Cumbria At primary school I remember learning how to identify trees by their leaves or bark. The ash tree, with its distinctive V-shaped markings, was one of the first I came to recognise. I used to marvel at its strength, its ability to withstand the harshest of weather conditions. Little did I know that this tree, a constant presence in our countryside, would soon become a symbol of fragility and loss. Now, as I stand in a once-lush woodland, the silence is deafening. The sun filters through the sparse canopy, casting long shadows over the forest floor. The ash trees, once the dominant species, are dying. The fungus that causes Chalara ash dieback disease is spreading rapidly, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The disease was first discovered in the UK in 2012, and since then it has spread at an alarming rate. The Ash Dieback Syndrome, as it is now known, attacks the tree's vascular system, weakening it and causing the leaves to wilt and fall off prematurely. The trees eventually die, leaving behind hollow, dead shells. Walking through the woodland, I see the signs of decay everywhere. The ground is littered with fallen leaves, and the once-verdant undergrowth is now a tangled mess of dead branches and decaying matter. The air smells of decay, and the silence is only broken by the sound of birds calling to each other in the distance. The impact of the disease is not just environmental. The ash tree is an important source of timber, and its loss will have a significant economic impact. It is also a vital food source for many insects, birds, and mammals, and the loss of this habitat could have far-reaching consequences for the entire ecosystem. As I walk further into the woodland, I come across a group of volunteers, working to clear the fallen trees and prevent the spread of the disease. They tell me that they have been coming here for years, watching as the woodland slowly dies. They speak of their sadness, their frustration, and their determination to do something to stop the spread of the disease. But despite their efforts, the disease continues to spread. The Ash Dieback Syndrome is a reminder of the fragility of nature, and the importance of preserving it before it's too late. As I leave the woodland, I am filled with a sense of sadness and loss, and a renewed determination to do what I can to help protect our precious natural resources. The Ash Dieback Syndrome is a reminder that we cannot take the natural world for granted. It is a call to action, a reminder that we have a responsibility to protect and preserve the world around us, before it's too late. And as I drive away from the wood",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Criminal injury compensation cuts to be reconsidered,"The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had wanted to restrict payments from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to those suffering serious injuries. But an MoJ spokesman announced on Wednesday that the government was reconsidering the proposed cuts in light of public and parliamentary opposition. The initial plans, which were due to come into effect in April 2023, would have seen the threshold for eligibility for compensation raised from common injuries such as broken bones and dislocations to only those with injuries classified as serious, critical or permanently disabling. This would have excluded an estimated 13,000 claimants each year from receiving compensation. The announcement of a rethink came after a cross-party group of MPs wrote to the Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, urging him to reconsider the proposed cuts. They argued that the changes would leave many victims feeling abandoned and unsupported at a time when they needed financial assistance the most. The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) and other organisations also condemned the proposed cuts, describing them as ""unfair"" and ""unjust"". APIL's president, James Maxey, said: ""It's not right that the most vulnerable people who have been injured through no fault of their own should be left to suffer financially."" The MoJ spokesman stated that the government was now engaging in discussions with stakeholders and would provide an update on the scheme's future in due course. He added: ""Our priority is to ensure that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides fair and appropriate compensation to those who have been injured as a result of a criminal act."" The news of the possible U-turn was welcomed by campaigners and victims' groups, who had feared that the proposed cuts would leave many people struggling to pay for essentials such as medical bills and lost income. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is a government-funded scheme that provides financial assistance to people who have been injured as a result of a criminal act. It covers a range of injuries, from minor ones to those that are life-changing or fatal. The scheme also pays out compensation to the dependants of those who have been killed as a result of a criminal act. The proposed cuts were part of a wider package of reforms to the legal system, which included increasing the small claims limit for personal injury cases from Â£1,000 to Â£5,000 and introducing a new dispute resolution system for low-value claims. Critics argued that the changes would make it harder for people to access justice and compensation, particularly those with less means. The announcement of a rethink on the criminal injury compensation cuts is a welcome development for those who have been campaigning against the proposed changes. It remains to be seen what the final outcome will be, but for now, there is hope that the government will listen to the concerns of stakeholders and ensure that the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Harry Uzoka death: Three guilty of killing London model,"George Koh, 24, stands accused of taking the life of his fellow model, Harry Uzoka, in a senseless and tragic dispute that escalated into fatal violence on 11 January. Accompanied by two friends, Koh allegedly confronted Mr. Uzoka in a residential building in Shepherd's Bush, London, with the intent of resolving an ongoing disagreement. However, the situation quickly spiraled out of control, resulting in a violent altercation that left Mr. Uzoka with a fatal stab wound to the heart. The incident, which unfolded in broad daylight, sent shockwaves through the modeling community and beyond, leaving family, friends, and colleagues in mourning. According to the Metropolitan Police, the dispute between Koh and Mr. Uzoka had been ongoing for several days, with both men exchanging threatening messages via social media. On the day of the incident, Koh and his companions reportedly went to Mr. Uzoka's apartment to confront him in person. The exact sequence of events that followed remains unclear, but what is certain is that the altercation ended in tragedy. Mr. Uzoka, a promising young model with a bright future ahead of him, was pronounced dead at the scene. Koh and his two accomplices were arrested shortly after the incident and have since been charged with his murder. The three men are currently in police custody, awaiting their next court appearance. The news of Mr. Uzoka's death has cast a long shadow over the fashion industry, with many models, photographers, and industry insiders expressing their shock and grief on social media. Mr. Uzoka was described as a talented and dedicated model who was always professional and respectful, both on and off the catwalk. The tragic incident has also highlighted the importance of addressing disputes in a peaceful and respectful manner, rather than resorting to violence. The modeling industry, like any other, is not immune to the tensions and disagreements that can arise between individuals. However, it is essential that such disputes are resolved in a constructive and non-violent way. The loss of a young and promising life is a reminder of the importance of valuing every individual and treating them with respect and dignity. Mr. Uzoka's tragic death serves as a painful reminder of the consequences of allowing disputes to escalate into violence. The modeling industry, and indeed society as a whole, must come together to ensure that such senseless tragedies are prevented in the future.

Foster carers' concern for children's welfare with cuts,"The Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers expressed deep concern over the potential repercussions of contract renegotiations with the Welsh government consortium, Buying Solutions for Children in Care (BSCC), which purchases their services. Philip Sutton, the association's chief executive, voiced his apprehensions, stating, ""We have been in ongoing discussions with BSCC regarding the future of our contracts, and the uncertainty is causing significant worry for our foster carers and the children in their care."" Sutton continued, ""Foster carers are dedicated individuals who provide invaluable support to children in need, often going above and beyond to ensure their welfare and wellbeing. The ongoing instability and potential cuts to their funding could have a detrimental impact on the quality of care these children receive."" The association emphasized that the current climate of uncertainty and potential cuts to funding could lead to a shortage of foster carers, exacerbating the existing crisis in the child care system. Sutton explained, ""Foster carers need to know that they have the resources and support they need to provide the best possible care for the children in their charge. Without this assurance, many may feel unable to continue, leaving a gap in the system that could be difficult to fill."" The association also raised concerns about the impact of potential cuts on the training and development of foster carers. Sutton stated, ""High-quality training and ongoing support are crucial to ensuring that foster carers have the skills and knowledge they need to meet the complex needs of the children they care for. Cuts to funding for training and development could lead to a decline in the quality of care and a potential increase in the number of children in care who are not receiving the support they need."" The Welsh government has not yet announced any definitive plans regarding the renegotiation of contracts with fostering providers, but the uncertainty has left many in the sector feeling anxious about the future. The association is urging the government to provide clarity and reassurance to foster carers, stating that ""the wellbeing of children in care should be the top priority in any discussions regarding contract renegotiations."" Sutton concluded by emphasizing the vital role that foster carers play in the lives of children in care, and the need for the government to recognize and support this role. ""Foster carers are essential to the child care system, and they deserve our support and respect. We urge the Welsh government to prioritize the welfare of children in care and to work with fostering providers to ensure that they have the resources and support they need to continue providing high-quality care.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Meryl Streep: Golden Globes organisers endorse speech,"The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) described the actress as a ""class act"" after Meryl Streep's impassioned speech at the Golden Globe Awards ceremony on Sunday night. Streep, a longtime champion of social causes, used her acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award to deliver a powerful message about the importance of truth and accountability in the entertainment industry and beyond. Addressing the room filled with Hollywood's elite, Streep began by acknowledging the irony of being honored by an organization that, until recently, had been criticized for its lack of diversity. She then proceeded to deliver a series of impersonations of various public figures, including President Donald Trump and former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, to illustrate her point. ""There was an embrace, there was a taking hands, and a feeling of 'I love you for expressing that,'"" HFPA President Lorenzo Sola recalled in a statement to BBC News. ""She spoke from her heart, and we applaud her for standing up for what she believes in."" Streep's speech was widely praised by attendees and viewers alike, with many taking to social media to express their admiration for the actress's courage and eloquence. Some even called for her to be considered for a Nobel Peace Prize. But not everyone was pleased with Streep's words. President Trump, who was the target of several of Streep's impersonations, took to Twitter to lash out at the actress, claiming that she was ""one-sided"" and ""over-rated."" Despite the backlash, Streep's speech was seen by many as a defining moment in this year's awards season, and a reminder of the power of art and activism to effect change. In a statement released after the ceremony, Streep thanked the HFPA for the accolade and reiterated her commitment to using her voice to speak out against injustice. ""I am deeply grateful for the recognition of my peers and the films and shows I have been fortunate enough to be a part of throughout my career,"" she said. ""I accept this award on the behalf of all the actresses inspired to speak up and to speak out.""

Disputed Â£92m Lincoln Eastern Bypass scheme gets green light,"Lincoln's controversial Eastern Bypass, a long-debated infrastructure project aimed at linking the A158 Wragby Road with the A15 Sleaford Road, has finally received the green light from the Department for Transport (DfT). The announcement came after a careful consideration of the various arguments and objections raised by local residents and stakeholders. Hundreds of people objected to the scheme, with concerns centering around the potential closure of a route into the city from the villages of Waddington, Bracebridge Heath, and North Hykeham. The proposed bypass was believed to cut through green belt land and disrupt local communities, leading to a significant outcry. Despite the strong opposition, the DfT has confirmed its decision to proceed with the Â£92m project. The scheme is expected to reduce congestion in the area, improve road safety, and boost economic growth by creating new opportunities for development. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps acknowledged the concerns raised by local residents but emphasized the potential benefits of the bypass. In a statement, he said: ""I understand that there are strong feelings on this issue, but I am convinced that the Eastern Bypass will bring significant improvements to the transport network in and around Lincoln. It will provide much-needed relief to motorists, improve journey times, and support local businesses by making it easier to access the city."" The DfT has indicated that the project is likely to commence in the coming months, with construction expected to take around three years to complete. The department has also pledged to engage with local communities throughout the process, providing regular updates and opportunities for consultation. Reactions to the announcement have been mixed, with some local residents expressing relief that the long-awaited project is finally set to go ahead, while others remain deeply concerned about the impact on their communities. Local councillor Tim Rushby-Smith, who has been a vocal critic of the bypass, expressed his disappointment at the decision but remained committed to working with the DfT to mitigate the potential negative effects. ""I'm obviously very disappointed that the Eastern Bypass has been given the go-ahead, but I will continue to work with the DfT to ensure that the needs of local residents are taken into account,"" he said. The Eastern Bypass is just one of several major infrastructure projects currently under consideration in the Lincolnshire area. The proposed High Speed Rail 2 (HS2) route, which would connect London with the north of England, is another contentious issue that has sparked intense debate and opposition from local residents and stakeholders. As the Eastern Bypass moves forward, it remains to be seen how the local community will react to the decision and whether similar concerns will arise with other proposed infrastructure projects in the region.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Channel migrants: More than 60 people found on Boxing Day,"Forty-nine people in four boats were met by Border Force officers and brought to England on Boxing Day, as the number of Channel migrants attempting the dangerous crossing continues to rise. The individuals, mostly men but including some women and children, were brought ashore at Dover and Folkestone after their small boats were intercepted. Two further boats were dealt with later in the day, bringing the total number of people rescued to sixty-one. The Border Force said that all were assessed for their welfare and given medical attention where necessary. The latest arrivals come as the number of Channel migrants reaching the UK continues to set new records. According to the Home Office, over 26,000 people have made the dangerous journey so far this year, more than double the total for the same period last year. The surge in crossings has put immense pressure on the authorities, with many calling for a more comprehensive response. Critics have highlighted the need for improved international cooperation, as well as increased resources for search and rescue operations. The Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, has said that the government is working to address the issue, including by increasing the number of Border Force officers and working with French authorities to disrupt the criminal networks facilitating the crossings. However, some have expressed concern that the government's focus on deterrence and enforcement is not addressing the underlying causes of the migration, such as poverty, conflict, and climate change. Amnesty International UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director, Elaine Storkey, said, ""The UK government must stop treating people seeking safety as a problem to be solved and instead focus on their human rights. The solution is not to deter or prevent people from coming, but to ensure safe and legal routes for those fleeing harm."" The issue of Channel migrants is not a new one, but the sheer volume of arrivals in recent months has placed it at the forefront of the national conversation. The government has faced criticism for its response, with some accusing it of being inhumane and ineffective. Meanwhile, charities and advocacy groups have expressed their concern for the welfare of those making the journey, many of whom are fleeing war, persecution, and poverty. They argue that the UK has a moral and legal obligation to provide sanctuary to those in need. As the number of Channel migrants continues to rise, the debate over how to respond to this complex issue is set to continue. With no easy solutions in sight, it is clear that this is an issue that will require a comprehensive and compassionate response from all sides.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Spy apprenticeship: Government launches new scheme,"Foreign Secretary William Hague announced the new spy apprenticeship scheme during a visit to Bletchley Park, the historic site where codebreakers helped to shorten World War II. Until now, the route to a career in intelligence services has predominantly involved going to university and then applying for jobs through the Civil Service Fast Stream or MI5's own recruitment process. However, the new scheme, which will be run in partnership with various universities and colleges, aims to provide an alternative pathway for those who may not wish to pursue a traditional academic route. Hague emphasized that this new approach will ""open up opportunities for a more diverse range of people to join our intelligence and security agencies."" The apprenticeships will last for three to four years and will cover areas such as cybersecurity, coding, language learning, and analysis. Trainees will receive on-the-job experience, as well as formal classroom instruction. They will also be given the opportunity to work on real-world projects and will be assigned a mentor from within the intelligence community. Speaking at Bletchley Park, Hague said, ""We want to ensure that our intelligence and security agencies have the very best people, from the widest possible range of backgrounds, to help keep our country safe. This new apprenticeship scheme will help us to do just that, by providing an alternative route into these vital roles for those who may not have considered a career in this field before."" The announcement was welcomed by industry experts, who have long called for more diverse recruitment practices within the intelligence community. Dr. Maria Sastre-Garau, a senior lecturer in Cybersecurity at the University of Westminster, said, ""This is a fantastic opportunity for young people who may not have considered a career in cybersecurity or intelligence before. The apprenticeship route offers a more practical and hands-on approach to learning, which is ideal for those who thrive in a dynamic and challenging work environment."" The government plans to launch the scheme in September 2023, with the first cohort of apprentices beginning their training in the following academic year. It is hoped that the scheme will attract a more diverse range of candidates, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, and will help to address the skills gap in the intelligence community, particularly in areas such as cybersecurity. As Hague left Bletchley Park, he was asked about the potential risks associated with bringing in apprentices who may not have the same level of formal education as other recruits. ""Of course, there are risks involved in any recruitment process,"" he replied. ""But we have robust vetting procedures in place to ensure that only the most suitable candidates are offered a place on this new scheme. What's more, the on-the-job training and mentoring that apprentices will receive will help to mitigate any potential risks and ensure that they are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"UK 'needs more bureaucrats for Brexit', says ex-diplomat","Sir Simon Fraser, a seasoned diplomat with extensive experience in European trade negotiations and a former permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, has warned that the UK needs to prepare for an increase in bureaucracy as it navigates its post-Brexit future. Speaking to the BBC, Fraser acknowledged the political sensitivity surrounding the issue of bureaucracy, with many Brexiteers having campaigned on a platform of reducing red tape and regaining sovereignty from Brussels. However, he emphasized that the complexities of leaving the EU would necessitate a significant administrative effort. ""The EU is a vast and intricate web of regulations and institutions, and leaving it is not a simple matter,"" Fraser explained. ""We are going to have to set up new institutions, new regulatory frameworks, and new procedures for trade and cooperation with our European neighbours."" The former diplomat went on to highlight specific areas where bureaucratic resources would be required, such as customs arrangements, regulatory alignment, and the negotiation of new international agreements. He argued that the UK government had yet to fully grasp the scale of the administrative challenge ahead, and that it was essential that sufficient resources were allocated to avoid potential delays and disruptions. ""The UK has historically been a country that has prided itself on an efficient civil service and minimal bureaucracy,"" Fraser acknowledged. ""But the reality is that leaving the EU is an enormously complex undertaking, and it will require a significant increase in bureaucratic capacity."" The warning from Fraser comes as the UK prepares to enter a new phase of Brexit negotiations, with talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU set to begin in earnest in the coming months. The government has faced criticism from opposition parties and some business groups for its perceived lack of preparation and resources, with many expressing concerns that the UK could face significant disruptions to trade and commerce as a result of a chaotic exit from the EU. Fraser's remarks also come as the EU prepares to finalize its own negotiating position for the future relationship, with the bloc's 27 member states expected to agree on a common stance at a summit later this week. EU leaders are expected to insist on continued regulatory alignment in areas such as industrial standards and environmental regulations, as well as the establishment of a level playing field for competition and state aid. Despite the challenges ahead, Fraser remained optimistic that the UK could ultimately forge a successful new relationship with the EU, but he stressed that it would require a serious and sustained effort from both sides. ""The UK and the EU have a long and complex history, and there is a lot of goodwill on both sides to find a way forward that benefits both parties,"" he said. ""But it will require hard work, compromise, and a recognition that the old model of UK-EU relations is no longer viable."" In conclusion",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Japan PM Abe condemns hostage 'death' video,"Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, demanded the immediate release of a second hostage, whose identity was claimed to be Kenji Goto, in a video released by the Islamic State (IS) militant group on Tuesday. The footage showed a masked man holding a knife, threatening to kill the hostage unless Japan paid a ransom of $200 million for the release of Haruna Yukawa, another Japanese citizen being held captive. The Japanese government, through its chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga, confirmed that it was attempting to verify the authenticity of the video and the identity of the hostage. Suga urged caution, stating that ""we should wait for facts to be clarified before making any definitive statements."" The release of the video came just days after the Japanese government announced it would contribute $200 million to an international coalition to combat IS, making Japan the largest individual contributor to the fund. The announcement was made following the beheading of another Japanese citizen, Haruna Yukawa, who was shown in a separate video released last week. The Japanese government had been in contact with the militant group to negotiate for the release of both hostages, but the demands for a large ransom had proven to be a major obstacle. The government had previously stated that it would not pay ransom to terrorists. Abe condemned the latest video in the strongest possible terms, stating that ""there is no justification for terrorism, and Japan will never give in to terrorism."" He also expressed his deepest sympathies to the families of both hostages and reiterated Japan's commitment to working with international partners to combat terrorism and bring the perpetrators to justice. The United States, which has been leading the international coalition against IS, condemned the video and offered its support to Japan. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that ""the United States stands with Japan in its efforts to secure the release of its citizens and to bring those responsible for these heinous acts to justice."" Meanwhile, the IS continued its campaign of terror, releasing a separate video showing the execution of an American hostage, Peter Kassig. The militant group had threatened to kill him if the United States did not release prisoners held in Iraq and Syria. The United States has confirmed the authenticity of the video and the identity of the victim. The latest developments in the hostage situation have raised concerns about the safety of foreigners in Syria and Iraq, where IS holds significant territory and carries out regular executions of hostages. The international community has urged caution and urged governments not to succumb to terrorist demands. As the situation unfolds, the international community will be closely monitoring developments and working to find a peaceful resolution to the hostage crisis and to combat the terrorist threat posed by IS.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Chinese firm set to buy House of Fraser,"Sanpower is expected to take an 89% share in the iconic British department store chain, House of Fraser, in a deal that values the business at approximately Â£450m. This investment marks a significant milestone as the largest foreign retail investment from China to date. Sanpower Group, founded in Nanjing in 1995, has been steadily growing its international presence, with House of Fraser set to be its most prominent acquisition to date. The Chinese conglomerate has a diverse portfolio spanning real estate, retail, and investment, with a particular focus on the luxury market. Sanpower's interest in House of Fraser began in 2014 when it acquired a 51% stake in the company. Since then, it has been working to turn around the ailing business, which has faced intense competition from online retailers and other high street stores. The planned acquisition comes at a time when Chinese companies are increasingly looking beyond their borders for opportunities to expand, particularly in the retail sector. According to a report by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, Chinese outbound investment in foreign retail reached $3.7bn in the first nine months of 2021, up 36% from the same period in 2020. House of Fraser, which was founded in Glasgow in 1849, has a rich history in British retailing. With over 50 stores across the UK and Ireland, it has long been a staple of the British high street. However, in recent years, it has struggled to compete with online retailers and other brick-and-mortar stores. The acquisition by Sanpower is seen as a lifeline for the business, which will inject new capital and expertise into the company. Sanpower's investment in House of Fraser is also significant for China-UK relations. The deal is expected to create new jobs in the UK and boost economic ties between the two countries. The British government has welcomed the investment and has expressed its commitment to promoting trade and investment between China and the UK. Despite the excitement surrounding the acquisition, there are also concerns about the potential impact on British jobs and the future direction of House of Fraser. Some have raised questions about Sanpower's track record in managing foreign acquisitions and its approach to labor rights. The Chinese conglomerate has faced criticism in the past for its handling of worker protests and alleged labor violations. As the deal moves forward, it remains to be seen how Sanpower will manage House of Fraser and what impact it will have on the British high street. One thing is certain, however: this acquisition marks a significant moment in the evolving relationship between China and the UK, and a new chapter in the story of House of Fraser. Sanpower's acquisition of House of Fraser is not only a bold move for the Chinese conglomerate but also a reflection of the changing global retail landscape.

Easyjet wants more women in the cockpit,"By Rebecca Marston, Business reporter, BBC News The Amy Johnson initiative, named after the first female pilot to fly solo from the UK to Australia, has prompted a surge in applications for Easyjet's pilot training programme. The airline, which has set a goal to have 20% of its pilots be women by 2025, says it's making progress towards this target. Easyjet's commitment to gender diversity in the cockpit comes as the aviation industry faces criticism for its lack of female pilots. In the UK, just 6% of commercial pilots are women, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. To address this issue, Easyjet launched the Amy Johnson Initiative in 2018 in partnership with the charity Women in Aviation UK. The programme provides scholarships for women to join the airline's pilot training academy. Since its launch, the initiative has attracted over 5,000 applications, with around 100 women currently training to become Easyjet pilots. ""We're delighted with the response we've had to the Amy Johnson Initiative,"" says Paul Simmons, Easyjet's director of flight operations. ""We believe that a more diverse workforce makes for a better business and we're committed to creating opportunities for women in aviation."" Easyjet is not alone in its efforts to increase the number of women in the cockpit. British Airways has also set a target of having 20% female pilots by 2025, while Ryanair has pledged to train 20 new female pilots every month. However, the path to becoming a pilot is not an easy one. It requires a significant investment of time and money, as well as a high level of physical and mental fitness. To help prospective pilots overcome the financial barriers to training, Easyjet offers a salary while they are in training, as well as scholarships and bursaries. The airline also provides mentoring and networking opportunities to help women progress in their careers. Despite these initiatives, there are still challenges to overcome. Women in aviation face unique challenges, such as balancing family life with a demanding career and dealing with gender stereotypes. ""We're committed to supporting our women pilots every step of the way,"" says Simmons. ""We provide flexible working arrangements and offer a supportive network to help them succeed in their careers."" Easyjet's efforts to increase the number of women in the cockpit are part of a wider trend towards greater gender diversity in the aviation industry. And with initiatives like the Amy Johnson Initiative, it's a trend that looks set to continue. ""We're proud of the progress we've made so far, but we know there's still work to be done,"" says Simmons.

Welsh Tory leader calls for parties to offer 'chance of change',"He stood before the assembled crowd, his voice steady and determined. Welsh Tory leader Paul Davies knew that the upcoming elections were a pivotal moment for his party. He urged his colleagues to seize the opportunity to offer the people of Wales a ""real chance of change."" Under Mr. Davies' leadership, the Tories had suffered a setback at the 2016 assembly election. The party lost three seats, leaving them with just 12 members in the Senedd â the Welsh Parliament. Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas, a prominent Welsh nationalist politician, capitalized on this weakened position to publically criticize the Tories. ""The people of Wales deserve better,"" Mr. Davies began, his eyes scanning the room filled with party members and press. ""We have to show them that we are the best option for achieving real change in their lives. We cannot afford to let them feel disenchanted with politics any longer."" Mr. Davies acknowledged the challenges his party faced, particularly in the context of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. However, he remained optimistic, stressing the importance of focusing on local issues that resonated with voters. He encouraged his team to engage in meaningful dialogue with communities, to listen to their concerns, and to offer practical solutions. ""We cannot simply rely on our past successes to carry us through,"" Mr. Davies continued. ""We must adapt and evolve to meet the needs of the 21st century. We must demonstrate that we are a party that is not only capable of governing but also passionate about improving the lives of the people we serve."" Mr. Davies' words were met with a mixture of nods and murmurs from his colleagues. Some expressed their reservations, citing the financial constraints that came with being in opposition. But Mr. Davies remained undeterred. He emphasized the importance of investing in grassroots campaigns to win back the trust of disillusioned voters. As the meeting drew to a close, Mr. Davies left his team with a final challenge. ""Let us not be defined by our past failures,"" he said. ""Let us instead be motivated by the potential for a better future. Let us offer the people of Wales a real chance of change."" With renewed determination, the Welsh Tory leader and his team left the room, ready to embark on the arduous journey towards regaining the trust of the Welsh electorate. The road to success would be long and fraught with challenges, but Mr. Davies was undeterred.

Ashya King 'not receiving chemotherapy',"By David Fenton, Health correspondent, BBC South Today Ashya King's father, Brett, made headlines last year when he took his eight-year-old son out of Southampton General Hospital against medical advice to continue his cancer treatment in Prague. The boy, diagnosed with a brainstem glioma in 2013, was initially receiving intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but his father believed there was an alternative treatment that could save his son's life. Brett King, a software engineer, raised over Â£200,000 through an online campaign to fund the controversial treatment, proton beam therapy, which is not available on the NHS in the UK. Ashya's case sparked a heated debate about parental rights and the role of the medical profession in making life-altering decisions for children. Now, more than a year since Ashya's controversial departure from the UK, his father has announced that his son is no longer receiving chemotherapy. During a recent interview, Brett revealed that Ashya's tumour is now in remission, leading some doctors to question the necessity of further treatment. ""We've had lots of scans and tests, and the latest MRI shows that Ashya's tumour is stable, and the doctors in Prague say that it's in remission,"" Brett told BBC South Today. ""We're thrilled with this news and are grateful for all the support we've received from around the world."" However, a leading UK cancer specialist, who asked not to be named, expressed concern about Ashya's diagnosis and treatment. ""Gliomas in the brainstem are notoriously aggressive, and the survival rate is low, even with intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy,"" the specialist said. ""The fact that Ashya's tumour is now in remission is remarkable, but it's too early to tell if this is a sustainable response or just a temporary one."" The specialist also raised concerns about the long-term effects of Ashya's treatment in Prague, which includes proton beam therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. ""Proton beam therapy is a valuable tool in the treatment of certain types of cancer, but it's important to remember that it's not a magic bullet,"" the specialist explained. ""It can have significant side-effects, including damage to healthy tissue and an increased risk of secondary cancers later in life."" Despite these concerns, Brett remains optimistic about his son's future. ""We've been through a lot, but Ashya is a fighter, and he's determined to live a normal life,"" Brett said. ""We're taking things one day at a time and focusing on the positive. Ashya is doing well, and we're grateful for every day we have with him.""

Winterton school stabbing: Girl held in attempted murder probe,"Arrested on Suspicion of Attempted Murder following School Stabbing Incident The tranquility of Winterton Community Academy was shattered on that fateful morning as an unspeakable act of violence unfolded within its hallowed halls. At approximately 09:00 BST, an incident of unparalleled severity transpired in one of the administrative offices. Humberside Police have confirmed that a 61-year-old woman was subjected to a vicious attack during this time. The assailant, a 16-year-old girl, allegedly wielding a knife, inflicted injuries upon the victim that left her fighting for her life. The school was immediately placed on lockdown as the gravity of the situation became apparent. The school's headteacher, Mr. John Smith, expressed his deep concern for the victim and the wider community in a statement issued to the press. ""We are shocked and saddened by the events that have taken place today at Winterton Community Academy. Our thoughts are with the victim and her family at this difficult time."" Mr. Smith went on to assure parents and guardians that the safety and wellbeing of students remained the school's top priority. He urged them to keep their children informed of the situation and to contact the school directly with any concerns or queries they may have. Humberside Police have launched a thorough investigation into the incident, with officers scouring the school grounds for evidence. The 16-year-old suspect, who has not been named, was taken into custody at the scene and is currently being held in police custody for questioning. Witnesses have described the scene as chaotic, with students and staff members visibly shaken by the events that had unfolded. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, recounted hearing ""loud screams coming from the direction of the administration building."" Another spoke of seeing ""police cars and ambulances arriving in a hurry."" The school community, once a haven of learning and growth, now finds itself at the epicenter of a harrowing incident.

Google v Oracle: Supreme Court declares Google's code copying fair,"Oracle, another tech titan, had sued Google in 2010 for copyright infringement over what it claimed was copied computer code. Android, Google's popular mobile operating system, used a Java application programming interface (API) developed by Sun Microsystems, which Oracle had acquired. Google argued that the APIs were not eligible for copyright protection because they were a form of ""ideas, concepts, and methods of operation"" rather than ""original works of authorship."" Oracle, on the other hand, maintained that the APIs contained creative expression and could be protected under copyright law. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which delivered its long-awaited ruling on April 11, 2014. In a unanimous decision, the Court declared that the APIs were not copyrightable and that Google's use of them in Android was fair use. ""We hold that the software interfaces at issue hereâthe specifications of how the parties' modules interact with one anotherâare a type of 'idea' or 'functionality' that lies outside the copyright law's protective umbrella,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court. Google welcomed the decision, with its senior vice president and general counsel, Kent Walker, saying in a statement that ""this is a win for programmers and for innovation."" Oracle, meanwhile, expressed disappointment and indicated it might appeal the ruling. The decision was hailed as a victory for the tech industry and for the open-source community in particular. Open-source software, which relies on the free use and modification of existing code, would have been severely impacted if Oracle had won the case. The ruling established a clearer line between what can and cannot be copyrighted in the context of software development. It also confirmed the importance of fair use in the digital age, where the line between copying and creating can sometimes be blurred. The Google-Oracle case was not the first time the issue of software copyright had reached the Supreme Court. In 1991, the Court had ruled in the case of Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co. that facts and information cannot be copyrighted. The Google-Oracle case extended that principle to software interfaces. The decision may also have implications beyond the tech industry. It could affect other areas where there is a need to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public's ability to build on existing works, such as music and literature. In the end, the Google-Oracle case was about more than just a legal dispute between two tech companies. It was about the role of copyright in the digital age and the balance between innovation and protection. The Supreme Court's ruling provided some clarity on these issues, but the debate is likely to continue.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Police warn of 'inadequate safety' at Greta Thunberg protest,"Avon and Somerset Police expect thousands to gather at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on College Green on Friday, where 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak. The force stated that while they support the right to peaceful protest, they are concerned about inadequate safety measures in place. A spokesperson for the police expressed their expectations for a large turnout at the event, stating, ""We understand the importance of this cause to young people and we are committed to facilitating peaceful protest. However, we have concerns about the safety of those attending, particularly in relation to the anticipated large numbers and the lack of adequate safety measures."" The spokesperson went on to outline their concerns, which include the potential for overcrowding, the risk of fire, and the need for sufficient medical facilities. They added, ""We have been in contact with the organisers to discuss these issues and to encourage them to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of all those attending. We will also be deploying additional officers to support the event and to ensure public safety."" The organisers of the event, Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate, have responded to the police's concerns by stating that they take the safety of attendees seriously and are working to address the identified issues. In a statement, they said, ""We acknowledge the concerns raised by the police and are taking steps to address them. We are working with the local council and other agencies to ensure that there are sufficient facilities in place, including medical facilities and fire safety measures."" The Youth Strike 4 Climate movement, which was inspired by Greta Thunberg's solo protest outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, has gained worldwide attention for its activism on climate change. The movement, which is made up largely of young people, has organised regular school strikes and protests in cities around the world. The Bristol event is just one of many taking place across the UK and around the world on Friday as part of a global day of action on climate change. Greta Thunberg, who has become a figurehead for the movement, is expected to speak at several events in the UK and Europe. While the police's concerns about safety are valid, some have criticised the force for what they see as an attempt to suppress the protest. Green Party co-leader Sian Berry tweeted, ""Police shouldn't be trying to stop young people from having their voices heard on climate change. They should be supporting them & keeping them safe."" Despite the concerns and criticisms, the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement shows no signs of slowing down.

Sri Lankan rights campaigner Jayalath Jayawardena dies,"By Charles Haviland, BBC News, Colombo He had a recent history of heart disease, but it came as a shock to many when news broke that Dr. Jayalath Jayawardena, a renowned Sri Lankan human rights campaigner and senior United National Party (UNP) figure, had passed away. He was 69. Dr. Jayawardena was a stalwart of the main opposition UNP and widely admired for his unwavering commitment to human rights and the rule of law. He featured in numerous international reports, including those by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for his work in defending the rights of the marginalized and oppressed in Sri Lanka. Born in 1952, Jayawardena began his activism during the late 1970s, a period of intense political violence and human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. He co-founded the People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PMHRE) in 1981, an organization that aimed to promote human rights awareness and education. Throughout his career, Dr. Jayawardena faced numerous challenges and threats, including intimidation and harassment from state authorities and extremist groups. Despite this, he continued to advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable members of society, including women, children, and ethnic and religious minorities. In the late 1990s, Jayawardena became a vocal critic of the Sri Lankan government's handling of the conflict in the northern and eastern provinces, which was then in its final stages. He called for an end to the violence and advocated for a political solution to the conflict, which ultimately led to his being targeted by the government and its allies. Despite the risks, Jayawardena refused to be silenced. He continued to speak out against human rights abuses and to defend the rights of those affected by the conflict. His work earned him numerous accolades, including the prestigious Rafto Prize in 1998 and the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 1999. Dr. Jayawardena's passing is a great loss to the human rights community in Sri Lanka and beyond. His dedication to defending the rights of the most vulnerable members of society, even in the face of immense personal risk, is a testament to his courage and commitment. In a statement, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe paid tribute to Dr. Jayawardena, describing him as a ""giant of the human rights movement in Sri Lanka."" He added that Jayawardena's ""unwavering commitment to the cause of human rights and the rule of law will be remembered and celebrated by generations to come.""

"Alexander Vindman, witness 'bullied by Trump', quits US military","Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a decorated military officer and former National Security Council (NSC) member, announced his retirement from the United States military on Friday, citing a ""campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation"" against him by President Donald Trump. This development comes after Lt Col Vindman testified before Congress in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's dealings with Ukraine. His concerns over a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, were at the heart of the investigation. In a statement, Lt Col Vindman's lawyer, David Pressman, said, ""This lawless conduct goes beyond the simple effort to intimidate, bully and retaliate against an intelligence official who had the courage to follow the law, it sets a dangerous precedent."" Pressman continued, ""Given the current environment at the White House, and believing that his continued employment there is detrimental to the integrity of the military, Lt Col Vindman has retired from the military."" The lawyer's statement did not go unnoticed by the White House. Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham responded by saying, ""Lt. Col. Vindman was given every opportunity to offer his allegations to appropriate departments and officials within the White House, and was heard. The Counsel to the President and the National Security Advisor made it clear to him and his attorney that they were unwilling to give credence to his affidavit, so unsurprisingly, he chose to pursue his desire for public attention by testifying before Congress, an absolutely false narrative that has been largely debunked."" Lt Col Vindman's decision to retire comes after months of public scrutiny and criticism from the White House. He was removed from his NSC role in February 2020, just days after his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. His departure from the military marks the latest chapter in a saga that began with a whistleblower complaint about a July 25, 2019, phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. During the call, President Trump asked President Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in exchange for military aid. The impeachment inquiry into President Trump's actions led to a polarized political environment, with Democrats arguing that President Trump had abused his power for personal gain, while Republicans defended the president's actions.

Slovakian 'slave' trafficked to Burnley for marriage,"The Romany victim's account of being handled as a ""human slave"" read like ""something from a 19th century novel by Dickens,"" Preston Crown Court heard on a chilly autumn morning. The harrowing tale unfolded as the court listened intently to the harrowing experiences of a young Slovakian woman, who had been trafficked to Burnley for the purpose of marriage. The victim, now in her late twenties, described how she had been lured away from her friends during a night out in Hungary, two years ago. She had been approached by a man claiming to be an interested suitor, who had promised her a better life in England. Trusting and hopeful, she had accompanied him without suspicion, only to find herself in the clutches of a human trafficking ring. ""He took me to a house, where I was kept against my will,"" she testified, her voice trembling with emotion. ""I was not allowed to leave, and I was forced to marry a man I did not know. He treated me like a slave, ordering me to cook, clean, and serve him."" The woman spoke of the brutal beatings she had endured at the hands of her husband and his associates. She was denied food and water as punishment for disobedience, and was forced to work long hours in the textile factory owned by the trafficking ring. ""It was like something from a nightmare,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I felt like I had no control over my own life. I was a prisoner, trapped in a foreign country with no way out."" The court was informed that the woman had managed to escape, with the help of local authorities and support from a charitable organization. Her husband and several members of the trafficking ring had been arrested and charged with various offenses, including human trafficking, slavery, and assault. Prosecutor Peter Livesey described the case as ""a shocking example of modern-day slavery,"" and called for stricter measures to be taken to combat the issue. ""This victim was taken from her home country under false pretenses, and was subjected to a life of cruelty and degradation,"" he said. ""We must do everything in our power to prevent such atrocities from occurring in the future."" The judge presiding over the case, Recorder Martin Walsh, expressed his disgust at the events, and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. ""This woman was treated as nothing more than a commodity, a disposable asset to be bought, sold and abused at will,"" he said. ""Such behavior will not be tolerated in our society."" The victim, now receiving support from local organizations and community groups, was praised for her courage in coming forward and testifying against her abusers.

UK to Zuckerberg: Show us you're sincere about regulation,"Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJon Twitter But now the UK's information commissioner has asked him to take action to show he means what he says. Elizabeth Denham has written to Mark Zuckerberg requesting that Facebook takes steps to demonstrate its commitment to upholding data protection regulations, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In her letter, Denham, who is the head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), highlighted the need for Facebook to be transparent about how it handles user data and to ensure that it is fully compliant with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The ICO launched an investigation into Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw the personal data of millions of users harvested without their consent. The data was then reportedly used to influence political campaigns. Denham's letter comes as Facebook faces growing pressure from regulators and politicians around the world to take more action to protect users' data. In the US, there have been calls for the company to be subjected to greater regulation, with some lawmakers even suggesting that it could be broken up. Zuckerberg has previously expressed his support for regulation, but Denham is not the first regulator to call on him to take concrete steps to demonstrate his commitment. In October, Ireland's data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon, wrote to Facebook requesting that it provide her office with details of how it intends to comply with GDPR. In her letter to Zuckerberg, Denham said: ""It is important that Facebook takes a proactive approach to rebuild the trust of its users. I would be pleased to engage with you and your team to understand in more detail the steps Facebook is taking to meet its data protection obligations and to address any concerns I may have."" Denham's letter follows a statement from Facebook last week in which the company said it was ""working cooperatively"" with the ICO and other regulators. Facebook also announced that it was setting up an independent oversight board to make binding decisions on the company's content and policies. However, some have questioned whether these measures go far enough to address the underlying issues raised by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The ICO's investigation into Facebook is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what penalties, if any, the company will face. In the meantime, Denham's letter represents the latest in a series of challenges to Facebook's business model and its handling of user data. The company will need to take concrete steps to address the concerns of regulators and users if it is to rebuild trust and avoid further regulatory action.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Danielle McLaughlin 'raped and strangled' - post mortem,"Danielle McLaughlin, a 28-year-old woman from County Donegal, Ireland, was found dead in a field near the tourist resorts of Canacona in Goa, India, on Tuesday morning. The discovery of her body sent shockwaves through the local community and beyond, as the popular traveller had only arrived in India a few weeks prior. According to local police reports, McLaughlin's body was discovered around 9:30 am local time, lying in a remote area about a kilometre from the beach. The cause of death was determined to be both rape and strangulation. The news of McLaughlin's death spread rapidly, with the local tourism industry expressing its condolences and assuring visitors that such incidents were rare in the area. Goa Police have launched a full investigation into the matter, with several leads currently being pursued. McLaughlin had travelled to India alone in late December 2019, with the intention of spending the winter exploring the country's rich culture and beautiful landscapes. She had been staying in a hostel in Canacona and had been known to frequent the local bars and restaurants. Friends and family of McLaughlin described her as a vibrant and outgoing person, with a zest for life and a deep sense of adventure. Her sudden and violent death has left them heartbroken and seeking answers. The Goa Police have appealed for any information that may help in the investigation, particularly from anyone who may have seen McLaughlin in the days leading up to her death. They have also urged tourists to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to local authorities. McLaughlin's body was taken to the Goa Memorial Hospital and Holistic Centre for a post-mortem examination. The results of the examination are still pending, but authorities have confirmed that a sexual assault kit was used during the examination. The Irish embassy in New Delhi has been notified of McLaughlin's death and is providing consular assistance to her family. The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, has also expressed his condolences and offered support to McLaughlin's loved ones. As the investigation into McLaughlin's death continues, the local community and tourists alike are left to grapple with the tragic loss of a young woman whose life was cut short in such a senseless and violent way. The incident has also raised broader questions about safety and security for tourists in India, particularly for those travelling alone. In the meantime, McLaughlin's family and friends continue to mourn her loss and to search for answers. They have set up a crowdfunding page to raise funds for her repatriation and for the costs associated with her funeral.

"UK fracking: Shale gas starts flowing, Cuadrilla says","Operations at Cuadrilla's shale gas site in Lancashire, England, resumed in October after a nearly decade-long hiatus. The halt in operations came in 2011 due to the occurrence of earth tremors, which raised concerns about the safety and environmental implications of fracking. Since the restart, the company has faced several setbacks. There have been suspensions of the renewed underground drilling operations after further tremors were detected. The latest seismic activity, which occurred on February 27, measured 1.1 on the local magnitude scale. Although this reading is below the threshold at which fracking activities must be halted, it has fueled ongoing debates about the potential risks associated with the process. Cuadrilla has emphasized that they are adhering to strict regulations set by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) and the Environment Agency. The company has implemented a number of measures to mitigate the risks of seismic activity, including reducing the volume of fluid injected into the well and monitoring the ground continuously for any signs of earthquakes. Despite these efforts, local residents and environmental groups remain skeptical. They argue that the potential risks outweigh the benefits, particularly in light of the ongoing climate crisis. Fracking has been criticized for its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as its potential impact on local water supplies and air quality. The resumption of fracking operations in Lancashire comes at a time when the UK government is under increasing pressure to reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources. Some industry experts argue that shale gas could play a role in this transition, providing a bridge fuel while renewable energy infrastructure is developed. However, others maintain that the risks and potential environmental harm outweigh any potential benefits. The ongoing debate about fracking in the UK is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. As Cuadrilla continues its operations at the Lancashire site, it will face ongoing scrutiny and criticism from local residents, environmental groups, and policymakers. The safety and environmental implications of fracking will remain a contentious issue, with significant implications for the UK's energy future. Meanwhile, the UK government has pledged to support the shale gas industry, announcing in February 2023 a Â£10 million fund to help develop the sector. The government argues that shale gas could help reduce energy bills and provide a domestic source of energy, but critics point out that the potential economic benefits must be weighed against the potential environmental and social costs. As the debate continues, it is clear that the resumption of fracking operations at Cuadrilla's Lancashire site is a significant moment in the UK's energy landscape. The outcome of this controversy could have far-reaching implications for the UK's energy future and its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

"Tax power restrictions 'starting point' for debate, says Cameron","UK ministers have proposed holding a referendum on granting the Welsh government the power to vary income tax rates, marking a significant point for debate in the ongoing devolution discussions. The proposed reform would allow the Welsh Assembly to set its own income tax rates for each band, subject to certain restrictions. The announcement, made by then-Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015, is seen as an extension of the devolution process, which has seen powers transferred from the UK government to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, the tax variance proposal has sparked intense debate, with concerns raised about the potential economic implications and the constitutional implications of varying tax rates across the UK. Under the proposed arrangements, each income tax band could only be moved at the same time. This means that the Welsh Assembly would not be able to adjust the rates for individual income tax bands independently. The aim of this restriction is to maintain a degree of fiscal stability and prevent a potential race to the bottom in tax rates between the devolved administrations. However, opponents argue that the restriction could limit the Welsh Assembly's ability to respond effectively to economic conditions unique to Wales. They believe that the Welsh government should have the flexibility to adjust tax rates in response to local economic conditions, rather than being bound by UK-wide changes. The debate over tax powers in Wales is not a new one. In the past, there have been calls for greater fiscal autonomy, with some arguing that Wales' economic fortunes have been unduly influenced by UK-wide economic conditions. The tax powers proposal is seen as a potential step towards greater fiscal autonomy, allowing the Welsh Assembly to set its own tax policy and potentially raise additional revenue. However, the constitutional implications of the proposal are significant. Critics argue that granting the Welsh Assembly the power to vary income tax rates could set a precedent for other devolved administrations, potentially leading to a fragmented tax system across the UK. This could create administrative complexity and potential economic distortions. Despite these concerns, supporters of the proposal argue that it represents an essential step in the devolution process, allowing the Welsh Assembly to take greater control over its own economic destiny. They argue that the proposed restriction on moving tax bands at the same time is a necessary compromise to maintain fiscal stability and prevent economic distortions. The proposed referendum on tax powers is a significant point for debate in the ongoing devolution process. It raises complex constitutional and economic issues, and the outcome of the referendum could have far-reaching implications for the future of the UK's fiscal arrangements. As the debate continues, it is clear that the proposed reform represents a significant moment in the ongoing devolution process, one which will shape the future of Welsh and UK politics for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Earl of Cardigan bound over in Savernake Estate row,"The Earl of Cardigan was accused of damaging six pheasant feeders and the theft of a battery and electrical power unit on the Savernake Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The allegations came following a dispute between the nobleman and the estate's gamekeeper, John Richards. According to Richards, the Earl had driven his quad bike across the feeders, causing significant damage, and had taken the battery and power unit from a game hatch in early November. The Earl, however, denied the accusations, stating that he had not been on the estate at the time of the incidents. The Savernake Estate, which covers over 3,500 acres of woodland and farmland, is owned by the Duke of Somerset. The Earl of Cardigan, whose real name is Edward Somerset, is a cousin of the Duke and has been a tenant farmer on the estate for many years. Following the accusations, the matter was taken before Wiltshire magistrates. The Earl was charged with criminal damage and theft and was 'bound over to keep the peace' until his trial, which is due to take place in February 2023. This means that he was released on bail but must not commit any further offenses or engage in any behavior that could disturb the peace. The incident has caused a stir within the local community, with opinions divided over the matter. Some have rallied around the Earl, expressing their support and accusing the gamekeeper of making false accusations. Others have sided with Richards, believing that the damage and theft were clearly the work of the Earl. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the incident has highlighted the tensions that can exist between tenants and estate owners, particularly over issues related to game management and the use of land. The Savernake Estate is known for its extensive deer and pheasant populations, and disputes over the management of these animals are not uncommon. The Earl of Cardigan's legal team has indicated that they will be mounting a robust defense against the charges. In the meantime, the nobleman has remained tight-lipped about the matter, refusing to comment on the allegations or the ongoing investigation. As the case unfolds, the eyes of the local community and beyond will be on the magistrates' court in Devizes to see whether the Earl of Cardigan will be found guilty or not. The outcome of the trial is likely to have significant repercussions, not just for the Earl but for the wider community and the relationship between tenants and estate owners.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tesco to fight dairy price-fixing fine from OFT,"The supermarket giant was one of nine firms facing penalties totalling close to Â£50m for colluding over the price of milk and cheese in 2002 and 2003. But Tesco expressed ""surprise and dismay"" that it was included in the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) investigation's findings, stating that it had not engaged in any cartel activity during that period. In a statement, Tesco said it was ""disappointed that the OFT has reached a different conclusion to the lengthy and detailed investigation carried out by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in 2012, which found no evidence of collusion in the dairy sector."" Tesco's surprise comes after the OFT reopened its investigation into the dairy price-fixing allegations following a tip-off from an anonymous source. The OFT's findings, published on Thursday, revealed that the nine firms had exchanged information on their prices and costs, allowing them to coordinate their pricing strategies and maintain high prices. The other firms implicated in the cartel were Arla Foods, Dairy Crest, First Milk, FrieslandCampina, Lactalis McLelland, Mansfield Park Dairies, Milk Marque, andwbMyners. Tesco insisted that it had not engaged in any collusive behaviour and that it had always acted in the best interests of its customers. ""Tesco has a long history of competitive pricing and we are committed to providing our customers with the best possible value,"" the company said. The OFT's investigation into the dairy price-fixing scandal was first launched in 2003 but was dropped in 2006 after the CMA found insufficient evidence to bring a case against the firms. However, the OFT has now reopened the case following new evidence and has announced penalties totalling Â£48.8m. The OFT's decision to reopen the investigation has been welcomed by consumer groups, who have long accused supermarkets of colluding to keep milk and cheese prices high. The Consumer Council for Water, which represents 15 million consumers, said the penalties were ""long overdue"" and called for greater transparency in the dairy industry. ""The fact that this collusion went on for over a decade is deeply concerning and highlights the need for greater transparency in the dairy industry,"" said Sue Davies, head of consumer protection at Which? The OFT has given the firms until 10 February to respond to the findings and to propose any mitigating circumstances. The final penalties are expected to be announced in the spring.

Google's Street View faces multi-state US probe,"It is the latest in a series of global investigations aimed at Google, following the admission that its Street View cars ""accidentally"" collected data from unsecured wi-fi networks in 30 countries due to some rogue code in the software. This time, the probe is being led by multiple states in the United States, raising concerns over privacy violations and potential legal action against the tech giant. The news comes after European regulators fined Google â¬150,000 ($171,000) in January for breaching data protection laws during the Street View project. This fine was in addition to a previous â¬25,000 fine in 2010, when the data collection was first discovered. Google initially claimed that the data collection was an unintended consequence of the Street View project's software, which was designed to identify and map wi-fi networks to improve the service's location data. However, it was later revealed that the cars were also collecting payload data, including emails, URLs, and login credentials. The multi-state US probe, which is being led by attorneys general from several states, including California, Connecticut, and Illinois, is focusing on whether Google violated state consumer protection laws and invaded people's privacy. The investigation is at an early stage, and it is unclear what penalties Google may face if found to be in breach of these laws. Google has apologized for the incident and has promised to delete any data that was inadvertently collected. However, this has done little to assuage the concerns of privacy advocates and regulators, who argue that the data collection was a clear violation of people's privacy rights. The incident has also raised questions over Google's data handling practices and its commitment to protecting user privacy. The tech giant has been under scrutiny for several years over its data collection and use policies, with concerns ranging from location tracking to targeted advertising. Google has faced similar investigations and fines in other countries, including Germany, France, and Spain. In each case, the company has apologized and promised to take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. However, the repeated occurrence of such incidents has led some to question whether Google is doing enough to protect user privacy and comply with data protection laws. As the multi-state US probe continues, it remains to be seen what penalties Google may face and what impact this will have on the company's reputation and bottom line. In the meantime, Google continues to face increasing pressure from regulators and privacy advocates to be more transparent about its data handling practices and to give users more control over their data. As the tech industry evolves and data becomes an increasingly valuable commodity, it is clear that companies like Google will need to take privacy seriously if they are to maintain the trust and loyalty of their users.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sellafield partly closed after 'above normal' radiation,"Each building was meticulously checked following the activation of a perimeter alarm at the north of Sellafield nuclear power plant. The incident, which unfolded on a chilly autumn morning, sent ripples of concern through the community and beyond. The alarm, it transpired, was triggered by higher than normal levels of radiation. The incident was a stark reminder of the delicate balance that exists at nuclear sites, where the harnessing of atomic energy is a constant dance between progress and safety. The company, Nuclear Management Partners Ltd (NMP), moved swiftly to assure the public that there was no cause for immediate concern. In a statement released later that day, NMP confirmed that initial tests had ruled out any external source for the radiation leak. They went on to explain that the source of the elevated levels was most likely a naturally occurring phenomenon. This was small comfort to those living in the immediate vicinity of the site, who have long been a vocal and often fearful presence in the debate surrounding the plant's operation. Many voiced their concerns on social media, with some calling for the site to be closed down permanently. The local council, Cumbria County Council, issued a statement reassuring the public that all necessary safety protocols were in place and that there was no need for panic. The incident at Sellafield was not an isolated one. In recent years, there have been several similar occurrences at nuclear sites around the world, including in France, Ukraine, and the United States. Each time, the authorities have moved quickly to downplay the risks, insisting that the public is not at imminent danger. But the fact remains that even small leaks can have significant long-term health effects, particularly for those who live in the vicinity of the site. The nuclear industry is under increasing pressure to adapt and evolve in the face of growing public concern and advances in renewable energy technology. In the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, many countries have re-evaluated their nuclear policies, with some opting to phase out nuclear power altogether. Others, like the UK, have pledged to continue investing in the technology, arguing that it is a necessary part of the energy mix. As the investigation at Sellafield continues, the spotlight is once again on the nuclear industry to demonstrate that it can operate safely and responsibly. With public trust at a low ebb, it is crucial that the industry learns from past mistakes and takes every step necessary to prevent future incidents. Only then can it hope to silence the criticism and maintain its place in the global energy landscape. For now, the community around Sellafield waits with bated breath, hoping that the initial tests were accurate and that there is no cause for further concern.

Tamboran: Licence for fracking plans terminated,"Tamboran, a Northern Irish oil and gas exploration company, was granted a petroleum licence in 2011 by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) in Northern Ireland. The licence, located in County Tyrone, gave the company three years to make a decision on whether to drill for shale gas using the controversial technique of fracking or abandon their plans. However, on a recent visit to the region, Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster announced that the licence for Tamboran had been terminated. The decision was made following a review of the company's progress in the area and their failure to meet the conditions of the licence. Foster stated, ""The licence for Tamboran in County Tyrone has now been terminated. The company had failed to meet the conditions of the licence, and it was necessary for the Department to take action."" The licence termination comes as a relief to many local residents who have been campaigning against fracking in the area for years. The technique, which involves the extraction of shale gas by fracturing rock formations, has been a subject of controversy due to concerns over its potential impact on the environment and public health. Local campaigners have argued that the potential risks associated with fracking are not worth the potential benefits. They have raised concerns over the potential for water contamination, air pollution, and earthquakes. Additionally, they argue that the economic benefits of fracking are overstated and that renewable energy sources are a more sustainable and long-term solution. Tamboran had been planning to drill exploratory wells in the area, with the potential to extract up to 20 billion cubic feet of shale gas. However, their plans had faced significant opposition from local residents and environmental groups. The termination of Tamboran's licence is a significant victory for those campaigning against fracking in Northern Ireland. It marks a step forward in the move towards a more sustainable and renewable energy future. However, the fight against fracking is not over yet. Other companies still hold licences in the area, and there is a risk that they may attempt to press ahead with their plans. Campaigners will continue to work to raise awareness of the risks associated with fracking and to push for a shift towards renewable energy sources. In the meantime, the termination of Tamboran's licence is a welcome development for those who have been campaigning against fracking in Northern Ireland.

"North Korea access to outside media up, says US study","The government's grip on controlling the flow of information into North Korea is weakening, according to a new study conducted by the United States-based organization, The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). The report, titled ""North Korea's Hidden Information Economy,"" provides an in-depth analysis of how outside media is making its way into the isolated country, and how the North Korean populace is responding to it. The study states that the government was unable to maintain a ""total monopoly"" over information. Viewing of foreign DVDs in North Korea, especially, had become more prevalent. According to the report, ""DVD sales and rentals have expanded significantly since the late 1990s and continue to grow despite government efforts to restrict their distribution."" The study further indicates that these DVDs cover a wide range of topics, including news, entertainment, and educational material. The report also sheds light on the role of Chinese and South Korean traders in supplying these DVDs to North Korea. Smuggling across the border is a common practice, with traders risking arrest to bring in these valuable items. ""Chinese traders in particular have played a crucial role in supplying North Koreans with a wide variety of media, including DVDs,"" the report noted. The outside media is having a profound impact on the North Korean people. The report states that ""the North Korean people's understanding of the world is changing, albeit slowly."" The study provides several examples of how this is happening. For instance, the North Korean people are becoming more aware of international events and issues. They are also developing a more nuanced understanding of their own country and its place in the world. The report also highlights the role of radio broadcasts in North Korea. Despite government efforts to jam international radio broadcasts, people are still able to access them. These broadcasts provide a valuable source of information and entertainment, and are often shared among family and friends. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued efforts to expand access to outside media for the North Korean people. The authors call for increased international support for initiatives that promote media freedom and access to information in North Korea. They also urge the international community to continue monitoring the situation closely and to respond appropriately when the North Korean government takes steps to restrict access to outside media. In conclusion, the report provides a compelling account of how outside media is making its way into North Korea and how it is impacting the North Korean people. It underscores the importance of continued efforts to expand access to outside media and information for the North Korean people, and the need for international support in this endeavor. The changing media landscape in North Korea is a cause for hope and optimism, but also a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fraud accused says MP Carolyn Harris attacked her,"Jenny Lee Clarke, who once managed Carolyn Harris's constituency office in Swansea East, took the stand at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday, denying allegations of fraud against her former employer. Ms Clarke, now 52, is accused of raising her own salary by an unauthorised Â£2,000 and cutting Harris's hours in the process. Ms Clarke began her testimony by describing her long-standing professional relationship with Harris. ""I have known and worked with Carolyn for many years,"" she said. ""I joined her team in 2008, initially as a part-time office manager, and later becoming full-time in 2010."" The court heard that Ms Clarke was responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of Harris's office, including payroll and financial records. However, she admitted that she had made an error in her own salary calculations in 2013. ""I mistakenly believed that my salary should be increased in line with a national living wage increase, despite the fact that there was no formal agreement in place for this,"" she explained. ""I deeply regret this oversight, and I understand now that it was wrong. I accept that I should have sought proper authorisation before making any changes to my salary."" Ms Clarke also denied allegations that she had reduced Harris's hours in order to boost her own salary. She claimed that Harris had agreed to the change in order to accommodate her own personal circumstances. ""Carolyn was going through a difficult time in her personal life, and she asked if we could arrange for her to work fewer hours,"" Ms Clarke said. ""I believed that this was a reasonable request, and I made the necessary adjustments to the payroll accordingly. I did not intend to deceive anyone or to benefit financially at the expense of my employer."" Under cross-examination, Ms Clarke admitted that she had not informed Harris or the Labour Party's national headquarters of the changes to her own salary or Harris's hours. She explained that she had believed that her actions were in the best interests of her employer and that she had acted out of a sense of loyalty. The trial, which is expected to continue for several more days, has shed light on the inner workings of a constituency office and the complexities of managing financial records. Ms Clarke's testimony raised questions about the importance of transparency and communication in the workplace, as well as the potential consequences of well-intentioned but misguided actions. As the hearing drew to a close, Ms Clarke took the opportunity to apologise for her mistakes. ""I deeply regret any confusion or distress that my actions have caused,"" she said. ""I have learned a valuable lesson from this experience, and I will ensure that I always follow proper procedures in the future.""

Windrush scandal: Compensation could be capped under proposed scheme,"Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme for the Windrush generation, the Home Office announced that a cap could be implemented to prevent individuals from receiving ""disproportionately high"" payouts. The proposed scheme aims to provide financial support to those affected by the Windrush scandal, which saw thousands of people, many of whom had lived in the UK for decades, threatened with deportation or denied access to public services due to issues with their immigration status. The Home Office stated that the compensation scheme would be based on ""individual circumstances"" and would take into account ""the severity and length of time that people have experienced significant difficulties as a result of the Home Office errors."" However, the potential cap has raised concerns among campaigners and community leaders, who argue that it could unfairly limit the amount of compensation received by those who suffered the most. Labour MP David Lammy, who has been a vocal advocate for the Windrush generation, expressed his concern over the proposed cap, stating that ""it is simply not acceptable for the Home Office to put a price on the suffering and trauma caused to the Windrush generation."" Lammy, who himself is of Windrush heritage, added that ""the government must ensure that every single person who has been wronged by the Home Office is fairly compensated for the harm they have suffered."" The Windrush scandal came to light in 2018 when it was revealed that hundreds of individuals, many of whom had arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 1960s, had been wrongly identified as being in the UK illegally due to errors in their immigration records. The controversy led to widespread public outrage and calls for the Home Secretary at the time, Amber Rudd, to resign. The Windrush generation, named after the ship that brought the first large group of Caribbean migrants to the UK in 1948, have made significant contributions to British society, with many serving in the armed forces, working in the NHS, and building the post-war economy. The Home Office has stated that the consultation on the compensation scheme will close on the 17th of February and that the final scheme will be announced in the spring. It remains to be seen whether the potential cap on compensation will be included in the final scheme, and if so, what level it will be set at. Campaigners and community leaders have called on the government to provide clear and transparent information about the compensation scheme and to ensure that those affected are treated with dignity and respect. They have also highlighted the need for ongoing support and services to help the Windrush generation rebuild their lives and regain their sense of belonging in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Greene King Black Boy pubs renamed in 'anti-racist' move,"Greene King, one of the largest pub companies in the United Kingdom, has announced that it will be changing the names of four of its establishments in an ""anti-racist"" move. The affected pubs include three called ""The Black Boy"" and one named ""The Black's Head."" This decision comes as part of an ongoing effort to address the historical use of racially charged names in British pubs and other establishments. Managing director Rooney Anand stated, ""We understand that some of our historic pub names may cause offense to some of our customers and communities. While we recognise that these names were commonplace in the past, we now know that they can be perceived in a different light."" Anand went on to say that the company is committed to creating an inclusive environment for all of its customers and employees. The three ""Black Boy"" pubs are located in Ipswich, Sudbury, and Bury St. Edmunds, all in the county of Suffolk. The ""Black's Head"" pub is situated in the town of Braintree, also in Essex. Greene King has not yet announced what the new names of these pubs will be. This is not the first time that Greene King has addressed the issue of racially charged pub names. In 2013, the company changed the name of a pub called ""The N-Word and Star"" in Norfolk to ""The Star Inn."" The previous name had caused controversy due to its use of a racial slur. The renaming of these pubs is part of a larger trend in the UK to address the use of racially charged names and symbols in public spaces. In recent years, there have been calls for the renaming of schools, streets, and other public institutions that bear the names of historical figures with controversial records on race. Some have praised Greene King for taking this step towards greater inclusivity, while others have criticized the company for bowing to political correctness. Regardless of opinion, it is clear that this is an important issue that requires thoughtful consideration and action. Greene King's decision to rename these pubs is not only an important step towards creating a more inclusive environment for its customers and employees, but it also serves as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging and addressing the ways in which historical racially charged language and symbols continue to impact our society today. Anand concluded by saying, ""We want to ensure that everyone feels welcome in our pubs, and that means taking a hard look at ourselves and making changes where necessary. We believe this is the right thing to do, and we are committed to continuing the conversation and taking further steps to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all."" The renaming process is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, and Greene King has encouraged customers and community members to suggest names for the new pubs.

"France: More than 2,500 break virus restrictions at illegal rave","Some of the 2,500 ravers in Lieuron near Rennes in Brittany had planned to party until Tuesday, defying France's strict coronavirus restrictions. But as the sun started to rise on Monday morning, the illegal rave came to an abrupt end. Police issued fines to revellers found leaving the scene, and a number of party-goers were taken into custody. The organisers of the event were being identified and could face more severe penalties. The rave, which took place in a forested area, had been advertised on social media and attracted a large crowd. Despite the risks involved, many attendees travelled long distances to be there. But the gathering was a clear violation of France's current health measures, which prohibit large gatherings and require people to wear masks in public spaces. The French government has been taking a firm stance against such events, with Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin warning last week that organisers would be held ""fully accountable"" for any breaches of the rules. The news of the illegal rave came as France reported another daily record of new coronavirus cases, with more than 20,000 confirmed infections on Sunday. The country has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks, prompting new restrictions and lockdown measures in some areas. Health officials have warned that such gatherings pose a significant risk of spreading the virus, particularly given the current surge in cases. Dr. JÃ©rÃ´me Salomon, the French health ministry's director-general for health, urged people to follow the rules and avoid large gatherings. ""We're asking everyone to be responsible, to avoid any situation that could risk spreading the virus,"" he said in a press conference on Monday. ""We're seeing a very high number of cases, and it's important that everyone does their part to reduce the spread of the virus."" The illegal rave in Lieuron is just one example of the challenges facing authorities as they try to enforce coronavirus restrictions. In recent months, there have been several instances of large gatherings and protests, some of which have turned violent. But despite the challenges, many French people have expressed their support for the restrictions and the need to prioritise public health. A recent opinion poll showed that 77% of French people believe that the current restrictions are necessary to combat the virus. France's Prime Minister Jean Castex is expected to address the nation on Thursday to outline the government's strategy for dealing with the current surge in cases. In the meantime, authorities will continue to enforce the restrictions and crack down on illegal gatherings.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cardiff Airport to get loan fund of up to Â£13m to attract new airlines,"The first Â£3.5m of the loan, from the Welsh government, will be drawn down by Cardiff Airport next year as part of a larger Â£13m funding package. Welsh ministers have described this loan as the most significant investment in the airport's infrastructure in over a decade. The aim of the investment is to attract new airlines and increase the number of flights from Cardiff. The airport currently serves over 1.5 million passengers annually, but airport officials believe that with the right infrastructure in place, they can attract more carriers and boost passenger numbers. The Welsh Government's loan is just one part of the funding package. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also committed Â£3.5m, while the airport itself will contribute Â£6m. The money will be used to upgrade and expand the airport's terminal building. This will include the creation of new check-in desks, improved baggage handling facilities, and expanded retail and dining areas. The terminal upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. Airport officials are hopeful that this will make Cardiff Airport a more attractive proposition for airlines looking to expand their networks. ""This investment is a game-changer for Cardiff Airport,"" said Debra Barber, the airport's managing director. ""We have been working hard to attract new airlines and increase the number of flights from the airport. This funding will enable us to make the necessary infrastructure improvements to make that a reality."" The airport has already seen some success in attracting new airlines. KLM began flying from Cardiff in 2020, offering direct flights to Amsterdam. EasyJet also announced new routes to Edinburgh and Dublin in the same year. However, airport officials believe there is still room for growth. They point to the fact that many passengers from South Wales currently travel to airports in Bristol or Birmingham, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. ""Cardiff Airport is the closest and most convenient option for people living in South Wales,"" said Barber. ""We want to make sure that we are offering the best possible experience for our passengers. This investment will help us do that, and we believe it will lead to significant growth in the number of passengers using the airport."" The airport is also investing in other areas to improve the passenger experience. This includes the installation of new security scanners and the expansion of its car park facilities. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, airport officials remain optimistic about the future. They believe that with the right investments in place, Cardiff Airport can become a major hub for domestic and international travel in Wales.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fifa 20: 'I play it at home and now my song is on the game',"By Levi Jouavel and Kirsty Grant Newsbeat reporters Yizzy, 19, has gone from studying and playing Fifa to having his song Hustle Hard featured on the game's soundtrack. The rapper, from Lewisham, south east London, told us about the surreal experience. ""I've been playing Fifa since I was a kid, it's always been a part of my life,"" he said. ""I'd come home from school, have a quick game before my homework, and now, my song is on the game."" Yizzy's journey into music began in earnest when he was just 16. He started making beats in his bedroom and rapping over them, inspired by the grime scene that was thriving in London at the time. But it wasn't until he linked up with a local producer that things really started to take off. They began making music together, and Yizzy's raw, honest lyrics quickly gained attention online. ""I was just expressing myself, talking about my life and the things I saw around me,"" he said. ""I never thought anyone would listen, let alone EA Sports."" EA Sports, the video game developer behind the Fifa series, reached out to Yizzy after hearing his music. They asked if they could use Hustle Hard on the game's soundtrack, and the young rapper was more than happy to oblige. ""I was speechless when they asked,"" he said. ""I've always loved Fifa, and now my song is a part of it. It's crazy."" The inclusion of Hustle Hard on Fifa 20 has given Yizzy a huge boost in exposure. His music has been heard by thousands of new listeners, and he's been getting messages of support from all over the world. ""It's a dream come true,"" he said. ""I never thought I'd make it this far, and now I'm on one of the biggest gaming platforms in the world. I just want to keep making music and seeing where it takes me."" Yizzy's success story is a reminder that you never know where your talent might take you. With hard work, dedication, and a little bit of luck, even the wildest dreams can become a reality. As for Yizzy, he'll be continuing to grind in the studio, working on new music and taking on the world, one verse at a time.

HIV flushed out by cancer drug,"By James Gallagher, Health and science reporter, BBC News website The cornerstone of HIV treatment, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), kills the virus in the bloodstream but leaves ""HIV reservoirs"" untouched. These reservoirs, hiding in cells throughout the body, are thought to be the reason why HIV continues to replicate despite ART. A team of US researchers has now shown that a cancer drug can flush these HIV reservoirs out of hiding. In the study, published in PLoS Pathogens, the drug, called HDAC inhibitor, was ""highly effective"" at activating and eliminating these hidden HIV reservoirs in monkey models. The study was carried out by researchers at the Harlem Hospital Center and the University of California, San Francisco. They used a type of monkey known as macaques, which are commonly used in HIV research because their immune system responds to the virus in a similar way to humans. The researchers infected the macaques with SHIV, a type of HIV that is closely related to the human virus. They then treated the animals with ART for six months to establish an HIV reservoir. After this, they stopped the ART treatment and started giving the animals the cancer drug, called Vorinostat, for 14 days. The results were impressive. The researchers found that the Vorinostat treatment led to a significant reduction in the number of HIV-infected cells and viral load in the animals' bloodstream. This is not the first time that HDAC inhibitors have been shown to be effective against HIV reservoirs. Previous studies have also shown promising results. But this study is significant because it used a higher dose of the drug over a longer period of time than previous studies. The researchers believe that the HDAC inhibitor works by making the HIV-infected cells more active, making them more vulnerable to attack by the immune system. The findings are significant because they suggest that a combination of ART and HDAC inhibitors could potentially eliminate HIV reservoirs and cure HIV infection. However, the researchers caution that more research is needed before this can be tested in humans. The study also raises the question of whether HDAC inhibitors could be used to prevent HIV infection in the first place. The researchers suggest that it might be possible to use the drugs to prevent the establishment of HIV reservoirs in people at high risk of infection, such as those who have been exposed to the virus through sexual contact or needle-stick injuries. The study is the latest in a series of developments in the field of HIV research. In recent years, there has been growing optimism that a cure for HIV could be within reach. However, much work still needs to be done before a cure can be developed and made available to those who need it. The researchers hope that their findings will help to move the field forward and bring us closer to the goal of a cure for HIV infection. """,Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pontypridd's Muni Arts Centre to close over debts,"The Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd, a cherished cultural institution in the heart of South Wales, closed its doors for good on Saturday, leaving the local community in shock and sadness. The centre, which had been a hub of arts and creativity since its opening in 1964, had been taken over by a limited company and charity, known as Muni Arts Centre Trust, following its closure in 2014 due to financial difficulties. A statement on the centre's Facebook page read, ""It is with heavy hearts that we have to announce that Muni Arts Centre has closed its doors for the final time. We would like to thank all of our supporters, customers, volunteers, and staff for their unwavering commitment and dedication over the years."" The news was met with an outpouring of grief and disbelief from the local community, who had long rallied behind the centre in its efforts to overcome financial challenges. A spokesman for the GMB union, which represented some of the centre's staff, expressed his disappointment and concern for the workers affected by the closure. ""We are deeply saddened to hear of the closure of Muni Arts Centre,"" he said. ""Our members have worked tirelessly to keep the centre running and have always been passionate about the role it plays in the community. We will be doing everything we can to support them during this difficult time."" The cause of the centre's financial woes is believed to be a combination of debts and a lack of funding. Despite numerous fundraising efforts and support from the local community, the centre was unable to overcome its financial challenges. It had been hoped that the takeover by the limited company and charity would provide a lifeline for the centre, but unfortunately, this was not to be. The loss of Muni Arts Centre is a significant blow to the cultural scene in Pontypridd and the wider community. It was not only a venue for live music, theatre, and comedy but also a place where local artists could showcase their work and where community groups could meet and thrive. The closure is a reminder of the importance of investing in and supporting cultural institutions, which often face financial challenges but provide essential services to their communities. As the community comes to terms with the loss of Muni Arts Centre, efforts are being made to find new homes for the various artistic and creative groups that called the centre home. It is hoped that these groups will be able to find new venues and continue their work, ensuring that the vibrant cultural scene in Pontypridd continues to flourish. In the meantime, the community is coming together to pay tribute to the centre and to celebrate its many achievements over the years.

Football and dementia: Alan Jarvis' death 'caused by heading balls',"Alan Jarvis, a former professional footballer who represented Everton and Hull City in the 1960s and 1970s, passing away at the age of 76 in a nursing home in Mold, Flintshire, has tragically been confirmed to have died as a result of dementia, with experts believing that his career-long devotion to the beautiful game may have contributed to his condition. Born in Birkenhead, Merseyside, Jarvis made his professional debut for Everton in 1963, going on to make 129 appearances for the Toffees, scoring 33 goals. He also represented England three times, earning his international caps between 1966 and 1968. Jarvis' impressive performances earned him a move to Hull City in 1973, where he spent three seasons, racking up 58 appearances and netting 11 goals. However, the accolades and triumphs of his footballing career have been overshadowed by the tragic circumstances of his final years. Jarvis was diagnosed with dementia several years ago, and despite the best efforts of his loved ones and healthcare professionals, his condition continued to deteriorate. His death on Monday, May 16, 2023, has left his family, friends, and the football community at large, deeply saddened and reflective. There is growing concern within the football world regarding the potential link between dementia and heading footballs, with an increasing number of ex-professionals being diagnosed with the condition. Sir Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst, and Nobby Stiles are just a few high-profile examples of former players who have been diagnosed with dementia in recent years. The findings of research studies suggest that the repeated trauma to the head from heading footballs can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain condition that causes dementia and other cognitive impairments. The Football Association (FA) and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) have announced plans to launch a major investigation into the issue, with the aim of providing support and compensation for those affected, as well as implementing preventative measures to minimize the risk of dementia and other head injuries for current and future generations of footballers. Alan Jarvis' tragic passing serves as a stark reminder of the importance of addressing this issue and supporting those affected by it. His footballing achievements will never be forgotten, but his legacy will also be one of raising awareness and advocating for better understanding and care for those living with dementia. The football community, united in grief and solidarity, will continue to honor Jarvis' memory and legacy by demanding action and change.

Australian casino shares tumble after China arrests,"In the midst of the global financial markets, a significant downturn was observed in the Australian casino sector on Monday, with Crown Resorts, a prominent player in the industry, bearing the brunt of the negative sentiment. The Sydney-based casino operator, controlled by billionaire businessman James Packer, saw its shares tumble by 13.9% following the confirmation of the arrests of 18 of its staff members in China. Among those detained was a senior executive, reportedly the company's vice president of international VIP operations, leading to heightened concerns over the potential repercussions. Crown Resorts is not the only Australian casino company with exposure to the Chinese market, as rivals such as Star Entertainment Group and The Star Entertainment Group also maintain significant operations there. Consequently, their shares were also negatively affected, closing 8.5% and 7.3% lower, respectively. The arrests of the Crown Resorts employees in China came just weeks after a similar incident involving 13 employees from the same company, who were detained in October 2016. In both cases, the individuals were reportedly accused of encouraging Chinese high rollers to gamble illegally, which is a serious offense in China. The arrests have raised questions about the legality of marketing activities targeting Chinese high rollers outside of the country and the potential risks for Australian casino companies operating in the region. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has stated that it is monitoring the situation closely and will assess any potential implications for the companies and their shareholders. The Australian government has also been in touch with Chinese authorities to seek clarification regarding the arrests and to ensure the welfare of the detained individuals. The uncertainty surrounding the situation has sent shockwaves through the Australian casino industry, as China is a major source of revenue for these companies. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Chinese tourists spent AUD 1.4 billion on gambling in Australia during the year ending March 2016, marking a 21% increase from the previous year. The potential loss of this revenue stream, coupled with the reputational damage and legal risks, has left investors jittery. In the wake of the arrests, Crown Resorts has stated that it is taking steps to ensure full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The company has also suspended all marketing activities in China and other relevant markets until it can ensure that its operations are in line with local laws. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the Chinese authorities will handle the cases and the potential consequences for the Australian casino industry. In the meantime, investors will be closely watching developments, with many likely to adopt a cautious stance until more clarity emerges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Google hit with â¬1.5bn fine from EU over advertising,"It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant, Google, in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party websites from displaying their own search boxes and comparison shopping services. The European Commission (EC) announced on Tuesday that it has hit Google with a â¬1.5bn fine, which is the largest antitrust penalty ever imposed by the EU. The EC's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that Google had breached EU antitrust rules by promoting its own comparison shopping service at the expense of its competitors. She added that Google had made it more difficult for rivals to compete in the online search market. Google has been given 90 days to stop the infringing conduct or face additional penalties. The company has already been ordered to change its business practices in two previous antitrust cases, relating to its Android mobile operating system and its AdSense advertising service. Google has responded by saying that it will appeal the decision. A spokesperson for the company said that ""the European Commission's argument is based on outdated and incorrect assumptions"" and that ""we respectfully disagree"" with the fine. The EC's decision comes after a seven-year investigation into Google's business practices. The case was originally launched in 2010, and the EC has been examining whether Google had abused its dominant position in the online search market. The fine is likely to have significant implications for Google's business in Europe. The company generates the bulk of its revenue from online advertising, and the EC's decision could make it more difficult for Google to dominate this market. The fine is also likely to have wider implications for the technology industry. The EC has been increasingly active in investigating and fining tech companies for alleged antitrust violations. In addition to Google, the EC has also fined Microsoft and Intel in the past. The EC's decision is also likely to be welcomed by Google's rivals, who have long argued that the company has an unfair advantage in the online search market. Some of these companies, including Microsoft's Bing and shopping comparison sites such as PriceGrabber and Shopping.com, have called for the EC to take action against Google. However, Google's opponents may not be celebrating for long. The company has a history of appealing antitrust decisions and has often been successful in having them overturned. In the meantime, Google will continue to dominate the online search market, generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. Despite the EC's decision, Google remains a powerful force in the technology industry. The company has a market capitalization of over â¬500bn and is one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world. The EC's fine may be a setback for Google, but it is unlikely to derail the company's relentless march",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Devon hospitals recruit nurses from abroad,"From 273 nurses employed by the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital (RD&E), 72 were from outside of the UK. This figure is a reflection of the growing trend of Devon hospitals recruiting nurses from abroad to address the shortage of nursing staff in the region. The situation at the North Devon District Hospital (NDDH) is no different. With 50 vacancies currently open, the hospital is actively seeking to recruit nurses from abroad to help meet the demand for healthcare services. NDDH's human resources department has been working tirelessly to process applications from nurses based overseas. The recruitment process includes verifying qualifications, conducting interviews, and arranging for visas and relocation assistance. The reasons for this trend are clear. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has been facing a nursing shortage for several years, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned that the shortage could reach 40,000 by 2024. Devon hospitals, like many others across the UK, are feeling the strain. The RCN reports that over a third of nursing posts in Devon are vacant, making it one of the worst-affected areas in the country. Recruiting nurses from abroad is not a new phenomenon. The NHS has been doing so for decades, particularly from countries like the Philippines, India, and Pakistan. However, the current situation has led to a surge in interest from hospitals looking to fill vacancies. The benefits of recruiting nurses from abroad are numerous. They bring valuable experience and cultural diversity to the workforce. They also help to reduce the workload of existing nursing staff, which can lead to improved patient care and reduced stress levels for nurses. However, the process of recruiting nurses from abroad is not without its challenges. The visa application process can be lengthy and complicated, and there are costs associated with relocating staff. Additionally, there are concerns about the impact on local nurses and the potential for creating a two-tier workforce. Despite these challenges, the benefits of recruiting nurses from abroad outweigh the drawbacks. Devon hospitals are committed to providing high-quality healthcare services to their communities, and recruiting nurses from abroad is an essential part of achieving that goal. As the recruitment process continues, it is hoped that the influx of new nursing staff will help to address the shortages and provide much-needed relief to existing staff. It is a challenging time for the NHS, but with the support of nurses from around the world, Devon hospitals are confident they can meet the demand for healthcare services and continue to provide the best possible care for their patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Wales child abuse: 38 calls to children's commissioner,"Keith Towler, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, has revealed that his office has received an alarming number of calls, totaling 38, regarding child abuse concerns in the principality. Towler, who was appointed to the role in May 2021, made the announcement during a recent interview. Some of these calls were from individuals wanting to make ""fresh allegations,"" Towler stated, adding that he would welcome further calls as his team continues to work tirelessly to safeguard the welfare of children in Wales. The commissioner's office is dedicated to ensuring that every child in the country grows up in a safe and nurturing environment. The calls to the commissioner's office follow a series of high-profile child abuse cases in Wales, including the abuse scandal at a care home in Anglesey, which saw multiple children being subjected to physical and emotional harm. The revelations led to widespread public outrage and calls for action. Towler acknowledged the concerns raised by the public and emphasized the need for continued vigilance to protect children from harm. ""It's important that people feel they can come to us with their concerns,"" he said. ""We take every call seriously and work closely with local authorities and other agencies to ensure that appropriate action is taken."" The Children's Commissioner for Wales also highlighted the importance of reporting any suspicions of child abuse, no matter how small. ""Child abuse can take many forms and can occur in any family or community,"" he said. ""It's essential that anyone who suspects that a child is at risk contacts the appropriate authorities without delay."" Towler's team has been working closely with local authorities and other organizations to support children and families in need. They have recently launched a new campaign, ""It's Up to Us,"" which encourages everyone to take responsibility for safeguarding children in their communities. The campaign provides practical advice and resources for individuals on how to spot the signs of child abuse and report their concerns. The commissioner also emphasized the need for ongoing investment in children's services to prevent child abuse. ""We need to ensure that there are sufficient resources available to support children and families,"" he said. ""This includes funding for early intervention services, training for professionals, and adequate support for families in need."" As the number of calls to the commissioner's office continues to grow, Towler remains committed to ensuring that every child in Wales grows up in a safe and nurturing environment. He urged anyone with concerns to come forward and report them, assuring them that their calls would be taken seriously and acted upon.

Outlaw King to be given world premiere at TIFF,"The Netflix historical drama, ""Outlaw King,"" starring Chris Pine as warrior king Robert the Bruce, is set to have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The highly anticipated film, which was shot primarily in Scotland, promises to deliver an immersive and thrilling experience for audiences. The movie, directed by David Mackenzie, follows Robert the Bruce after his defeat at the Battle of Loudoun Hill in 1304. Fleeing for his life, Robert goes into hiding and embarks on a quest for redemption and revenge against the oppressive English crown. Pine, best known for his roles in ""Star Trek"" and ""Wonder Woman,"" delivers a powerhouse performance as the embattled monarch. Filming for ""Outlaw King"" began in early 2017 and took place across various locations in Scotland, including the Trossachs National Park and the historic Doune Castle. The decision to shoot primarily in Scotland was a deliberate one, as the filmmakers wanted to capture the raw beauty and rugged terrain that would serve as the backdrop for the story. In an interview with Deadline, Mackenzie spoke about the challenges of filming in Scotland and the importance of authenticity in bringing the story to life. ""We wanted to immerse ourselves in the landscape, to feel the weather and the elements. Scotland is such an integral part of the story, and it felt right to shoot there,"" he said. ""Outlaw King"" also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Florence Pugh, and Tony Curran.

Irish general election: Voting is under way to elect new parliament,"The Irish parliament (DÃ¡il) has reduced in size, meaning any new government needs the support of nearly 80 elected members (called TeachtaÃ­ DÃ¡la or TDs) to command a majority. With voting now underway in the 33rd DÃ¡il election, parties are vying for the support of the electorate to secure their place in the next legislative term. The electoral map of Ireland has changed significantly since the last election in 2020. Constituency boundaries have been adjusted to reflect population growth, leading to some high-profile races and political realignments. In Dublin, for instance, the reconfiguration of constituencies has created a three-way battle in some areas between Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael, and Sinn FÃ©in. Over 3.5 million registered voters will go to the polls today, with polling stations open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Irish citizens living abroad can also cast their ballots in various embassies and consulates around the world. The Electoral Commission is responsible for overseeing the election process, ensuring that every vote is counted fairly and accurately. While there is a generally positive atmosphere surrounding the election, some issues have dominated the campaign trail. The cost of living crisis, climate change, and healthcare have been the main topics of debate among the political parties. Some parties have also focused on Ireland's relationship with the European Union and the UK, following the Brexit deal. The current coalition government, formed between Fianna FÃ¡il, Fine Gael, and the Green Party, has faced criticism over its handling of various issues, particularly the housing crisis, which has seen rents and house prices continue to rise. Sinn FÃ©in, the largest opposition party, has positioned itself as a viable alternative, offering a more radical approach to addressing these issues. Labour, the Social Democrats, and Independent TDs are also contesting the election, hoping to secure enough seats to influence the political landscape of the next DÃ¡il. In a hung parliament scenario, where no single party can form a government, these smaller parties could hold the balance of power and potentially influence policy decisions. As the votes are counted and the results begin to emerge, the political parties will assess their performance and consider the possibilities for forming a new government. The electorate, meanwhile, will eagerly await the outcome, hoping for a stable and effective government that addresses their priorities and concerns. With a vibrant and diverse range of political parties, the Irish election promises to be an intriguing and closely-watched event. The outcome of today's vote will shape the future of Irish politics and have far-reaching implications for the country and its people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Google and Facebook duped in huge 'scam',"By Chris Baraniuk Technology reporter In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" that were not named at the time. Now, new information has emerged suggesting that those companies were in fact Google and Facebook. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the charges against Evaldas Rimasauskas in March, stating that he had carried out a ""Business Email Compromise (BEC) scheme"" that had defrauded his victims out of more than $100m (Â£76m). According to court documents unsealed on Monday, the scheme involved Rimasauskas registering companies with names similar to those of the two tech firms. He then used these companies to send out emails to the victims, posing as vendors or suppliers and requesting payments. In one instance, the DoJ says, Rimasauskas was able to intercept and alter the transfer instructions for a $100m payment that was intended for Google. He directed the funds into an account belonging to his own company, which he had registered in Latvia. Google and Facebook have declined to comment on the matter. However, a spokesperson for Facebook told the BBC that the company had ""not been notified by any banks or authorities that we have been a victim of this type of scam"". Google, meanwhile, has previously acknowledged that it has been targeted by BEC scams. In 2017, the company reported that it had lost more than $100m in a single scam, although it is not clear if that incident is related to the one described in the DoJ's filing. BEC scams have become increasingly common in recent years. According to a report by the FBI, such scams cost US businesses more than $3bn in 2018, up from $1.3bn in 2016. In these attacks, scammers often impersonate executives or vendors, and use emails and invoices that appear legitimate to trick their victims into making payments to fraudulent accounts. The scams can be difficult to detect, as they can involve sophisticated social engineering techniques. The case against Rimasauskas is not the first time that a major tech firm has been targeted in such a scam. In 2016, Microsoft revealed that it had been targeted by a BEC scam that had attempted to steal $4m from the company. And in 2017, Twitter confirmed that it had been targeted by a similar attack, in which scammers had attempted to trick employees into transferring money to fraudulent accounts. Despite the risks, there are steps that businesses can take to protect themselves from BEC scams. These include training employees to be vigilant for suspicious emails, using multi-",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
US Senate passes sanctions on Iran central bank,"The US Senate took a significant step towards ratcheting up pressure on Iran's economy by passing a bipartisan bill that imposes sanctions on the Islamic Republic's central bank. The measures, passed by 100 votes to nil, would ban foreign firms from doing business with the Iranian Central Bank, effectively cutting off a major source of revenue for the Iranian government. The move comes as tensions between Tehran and the West continue to simmer over Iran's controversial nuclear program, which the international community believes is being developed for military purposes. The US and its allies have imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran in an attempt to force it to abandon its nuclear ambitions. However, this latest move could have far-reaching consequences, potentially disrupting global oil markets and complicating diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. The European Union, China, and Russia have all expressed concern about the potential impact of the sanctions on global oil markets and the wider economy. Before it can become law, the bill must be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Barack Obama. The White House has expressed reservations about the bill, with Press Secretary Jay Carney stating that ""the administration opposes legislative efforts to impose new sanctions on Iran at this time."" Obama believes that the current sanctions regime is effective and that diplomacy should be given a chance to work. He has also expressed concern that new sanctions could jeopardize ongoing negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 group (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) aimed at reaching a comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear program. However, supporters of the bill argue that the current sanctions have not been effective in bringing about a change in Iranian behavior. They point to the fact that Iran's economy is in a state of crisis, with high inflation, unemployment, and a rapidly declining currency. They argue that further sanctions are necessary to bring Iran to the negotiating table and force it to abandon its nuclear program. The passage of the bill is a significant development in the ongoing standoff between Iran and the West. It is likely to spark a diplomatic backlash from Tehran, which has previously threatened to retaliate against any new sanctions with its own measures. It also raises the prospect of further escalation in the crisis, with the possibility of military action remaining a real threat. The next few weeks will be critical in determining the fate of the bill. If it is approved by the House and signed into law by Obama, it will represent a major shift in US policy towards Iran and could have significant implications for the global economy and geopolitical landscape. However, if it is blocked, it will be seen as a victory for those who believe that diplomacy is the best way to resolve the crisis. Either way, the showdown between Iran and the West is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK ministers halt Scottish fracking ahead of Holyrood move,"UK ministers have announced a pause in fracking operations in Scotland, following the devolution of new powers over the industry to the Scottish Parliament. The decision comes as the Scottish Government prepares to take control of fracking licensing and regulation, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. The UK Government's decision was made in the wake of a consultation on fracking in Scotland, which closed earlier this year. The consultation received over 60,000 responses, the majority of which called for a ban on the controversial energy extraction method. Despite the public opposition, UK ministers will, however, consult with companies which have already applied for licences before any final decision is made. The Scottish Government has made it clear that any existing licences will not be automatically renewed, and that new applications will be subject to its own regulations. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, welcomed the UK Government's announcement, but warned that it was not a definitive end to fracking in Scotland. She reiterated her government's commitment to exploring renewable energy sources and reducing Scotland's carbon emissions. The Scottish Greens, who have long campaigned against fracking, welcomed the pause in operations but called for a complete ban. Patrick Harvie, the co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said that the ""writing is on the wall"" for the fracking industry in Scotland. The pause in fracking operations in Scotland comes at a time when the industry is facing increasing opposition both here and abroad. In the UK, several local councils have declared themselves ""frack-free,"" and there are concerns over the potential health risks and environmental impact of the process. In the US, where fracking has been more widely used, there have been reports of water contamination and earthquakes linked to fracking operations. The Scottish Government's move to take control of fracking licensing and regulation is seen as a significant step towards a frack-free future for Scotland. However, it is expected that the issue will continue to be a contentious one, with some in the energy industry arguing that fracking is an essential part of the UK's energy mix. As the UK Government consults with companies and the Scottish Parliament prepares to take control of fracking regulations, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the industry in Scotland. One thing is clear, though: the debate over fracking is far from over. In the meantime, the Scottish Government will continue to explore renewable energy sources, such as wind, wave, and solar power, as part of its commitment to reducing Scotland's carbon emissions and moving towards a more sustainable energy future. Despite the pause in fracking operations, UK ministers have not ruled out the possibility of the industry playing a role in Scotland's energy mix in the future.

Jeremy Corbyn says he could work with Andy Burnham as Labour leader,"Mr Jeremy Corbyn, the veteran Labour MP and former party leader, has indicated that he could potentially work with Andy Burnham if the latter were to win the current Labour leadership contest. This came after Mr Burnham had earlier stated that if he secured the victory, he would offer Mr Corbyn a role in his shadow cabinet. However, this proposition was met with opposition from fellow leadership candidate Yvette Cooper. During a debate on ITV's ""Peston on Sunday"" programme, she expressed her concerns, stating that Mr Corbyn's presence in the shadow cabinet could harm the party's chances of winning the next general election. Reacting to this, Mr Corbyn told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" that he was open to the idea of working with Mr Burnham, should he become Labour leader. ""I've always worked in a collective way. I think it's important that we all work together,"" he said. ""I've known Andy for many, many years. I respect his views, I respect his politics, and I'm sure we could find areas of agreement."" Mr Corbyn's comments were met with a mixed response from the Labour membership. While some welcomed the prospect of unity within the party, others expressed scepticism, arguing that Mr Corbyn's leadership had led to a series of electoral defeats. Meanwhile, Mr Burnham continued to emphasise the importance of unity within Labour, stating that he was open to working with all Labour MPs, regardless of their previous views or stances. ""We need to come together as a party,"" he said. ""We need to focus on the things that unite us, not the things that divide us."" Despite this, the leadership contest remains a closely contested race, with all three candidates â Mr Burnham, Mr Corbyn, and Ms Cooper â vying for the support of Labour members. The outcome of the contest could have significant implications for the future direction of the party, as well as its chances of winning the next general election. It remains to be seen whether Mr Corbyn's indication of a willingness to work with Mr Burnham will sway any undecided voters. Regardless, it is clear that the Labour Party is at a crossroads, and that the next few weeks will be crucial in determining its future course. As the leadership contest unfolds, one thing is certain: Labour needs to find a way to come together if it is to win back the trust and support of the British electorate. Whether that means working with figures like Mr Corbyn, or taking a new direction altogether, remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the stakes could not be higher.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK water industry: How does it work?,"England: The Water Industry's Regulatory Framework and Functioning Ofwat, the Office of Water Services, is the independent regulator for the water and sewage industry in England and Wales. Established under the Water Industry Act 1991, Ofwat holds a crucial responsibility: protecting customers' interests and ensuring that water and sewage companies operate efficiently, effectively, and sustainably. Ofwat says: ""Our role is to help create a resilient and efficient water and sewage sector that delivers high-quality services for all its customers, now and in the future."" The five key areas Ofwat focuses on to achieve this objective are: 1. Customer protection: Ensuring companies prioritise their customers' needs and engage them in decision-making processes. 2. Economic regulation: Setting the prices, service quality targets, and business plans for water and sewage companies. 3. Environmental sustainability: Encouraging companies to minimize environmental impact, promote water efficiency, and invest in green technology. 4. Infrastructure: Ensuring companies invest in upgrading their ageing infrastructure and maintain the necessary standards. 5. Market competition: Encouraging competition in the water industry to improve efficiency and service quality. Water and sewage companies in England and Wales submit business plans to Ofwat every five years, outlining their proposals for investment, service improvements, and price increases. Ofwat then reviews each plan and sets the prices and quality targets accordingly. Ofwat's role extends beyond regulatory oversight. The regulator also works with the Environment Agency to ensure that water companies comply with the standards set by the Water Framework Directive, which aims to protect and improve the quality of Europe's inland and coastal waters. Furthermore, Ofwat plays a critical role in managing the Water Industry Levy Scheme, which redistributes a portion of the water companies' profits to those in the industry that require financial assistance. Water companies depend on a solid infrastructure to deliver their services. The network consists of a complex web of reservoirs, treatment works, water mains, and sewage treatment plants. Ofwat works with the companies to maintain and upgrade this infrastructure, ensuring that it meets the necessary standards and can withstand the demands of a growing population. In conclusion, the water industry in England and Wales operates under the regulatory framework of Ofwat, which focuses on customer protection, economic regulation, environmental sustainability, infrastructure development, and market competition. Ofwat's role is crucial in ensuring the industry delivers high-quality services while minimizing environmental impact and maintaining a financially sustainable sector.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hepatitis C vaccine: Oxford researchers' trial 'promising',"Designing a vaccine for Hepatitis C has been a formidable challenge due to the virus's ability to evade the immune system by constantly changing its appearance. This has made it difficult to find a reliable target for vaccine development. However, a team of researchers from the University of Oxford, working in collaboration with the Jenner Institute and Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, have reported promising results from their latest trial. Publishing their findings in the scientific journal Science Translational Medicine, the team describes the development of a new vaccine candidate, called BCDA-11, which uses a novel approach to target a broad range of Hepatitis C strains. The vaccine is based on a viral protein called non-structural protein 5A (NS5A), which is essential for the replication of the virus. Unlike previous attempts to create a Hepatitis C vaccine, which have focused on targeting the virus's surface proteins, the Oxford researchers' approach targets a conserved region of NS5A, which is less likely to mutate. This means that the vaccine could potentially provide protection against a wider range of Hepatitis C strains. The trial, which involved 30 healthy volunteers, showed that the vaccine was safe and generated a robust immune response in all participants. The researchers were particularly encouraged by the fact that the vaccine stimulated the production of both antibodies and T-cells, which are key components of the immune system's defenses against viral infections. Furthermore, the vaccine was effective in neutralizing a wide range of Hepatitis C strains, suggesting that it could provide protection against multiple variants of the virus. This is a significant advancement, as current treatments for Hepatitis C can be expensive and come with potential side effects. The researchers are now planning to conduct larger clinical trials to test the vaccine's efficacy in preventing Hepatitis C infection in at-risk populations. If successful, the vaccine could potentially be used to prevent the spread of the virus in areas with high prevalence rates, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. The research team is optimistic about the potential of their new vaccine candidate, and they are hopeful that it could one day lead to the development of a globally available and effective Hepatitis C vaccine. However, they caution that more research is needed before the vaccine can be approved for use in the general population. In conclusion, the Oxford researchers' trial represents a promising step forward in the development of a Hepatitis C vaccine. Their novel approach to targeting a conserved region of the virus's NS5A protein has shown promising results in initial trials, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy in preventing Hepatitis C infection in larger populations. If successful, this vaccine could potentially provide a much-needed solution to the ongoing global health challenge pos",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China jails journalist over leaked 'state secrets',"Gao Yu, a renowned Chinese investigative journalist and democratic activist, was sentenced to seven years in prison by a Beijing court on Wednesday, August 5, 2014. The court verdict stated that Gao, 71, had ""illegally provided state secrets to foreigners."" However, China's authorities have yet to disclose which document the case concerns, fuelling speculation that it may be linked to a leaked Communist Party strategy paper. Gao Yu, a former editor-in-chief of the now-defunct China Democratic Party's publication ""Democratic China,"" was taken into custody in April 2014. Her arrest came amid a broader crackdown on dissent and free speech in China, as the government tightened its grip on online information and censored critical voices. The charges against Gao Yu are not new in China's authoritarian system. In recent years, several journalists, activists, and scholars have been detained on similar charges, often involving the alleged possession or dissemination of state secrets. However, the case of Gao Yu and the leaked Communist Party strategy paper has drawn significant attention due to its potential significance. The paper, reportedly titled ""Document No. 9,"" outlines the Chinese Communist Party's approach to maintaining social stability and preventing the spread of ""Western"" ideologies. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining Party control over the media, education, law, and other areas. The leaked document's content has raised concerns among human rights groups and democratic activists, who see it as an indication of the Chinese government's growing intolerance for dissent and its determination to suppress any challenges to its authority. Gao Yu's case has been widely criticized by human rights organizations and the international community. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Committee to Protect Journalists have called for her release and condemned the Chinese government's continued suppression of free speech and dissent. Despite the international pressure, the Chinese authorities have shown no signs of backing down. Gao Yu's sentence is just the latest in a series of high-profile arrests and detentions of Chinese dissidents and activists. It serves as a reminder of China's tightening grip on free speech and its determination to maintain control over information in the digital age. The case of Gao Yu and the leaked Communist Party strategy paper highlights the challenges facing China's human rights situation and its commitment to democratic reforms. As the Chinese government continues to tighten its control over information and dissent, the international community must remain vigilant and continue to press for change. Despite the difficult circumstances, Gao Yu's supporters and colleagues remain hopeful. They believe that her courage and determination to seek the truth will inspire others to follow in her footsteps and continue the fight for democracy and human rights in China.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Nearly 200 Wales carers 'had to give up jobs' to look after family,"By India Pollock, BBC Wales social affairs correspondent Carers Wales found the figure amounted to just under half of the people it surveyed â 195 in total â who had to give up their jobs to care for a loved one. This startling statistic highlights the financial and emotional strain that many carers in Wales face. The survey, which gathered responses from over 400 carers, revealed that 48% had to quit their employment to provide care. The majority of these carers were women, with 78% being females aged between 45 and 64. Their caring responsibilities ranged from looking after a spouse with dementia to caring for a child with complex needs. Carers Wales has called on the Welsh Government to address this issue, urging them to take action to support carers in their employment and to provide more resources to help them to balance their caring responsibilities with paid work. The organisation's Chief Executive, Debbie de Wit, stated, ""These figures are a stark reminder of the sacrifices that many carers in Wales are making every day. We understand that many carers want to continue working, but the current system fails to provide the necessary support to enable them to do so. We need the Welsh Government to take action now to ensure that carers are not being forced to choose between their caring responsibilities and their employment."" Carers Wales is not alone in its call for action. The Welsh Government has pledged to double the number of carers who are able to access flexible employment support by 2025. However, there are concerns that this target may not be met, given the current lack of resources and support available to carers. The organisation is also campaigning for the introduction of a statutory right to carer's leave, similar to parental leave. This would enable carers to take time off from work to care for a loved one without fear of losing their job or income. The financial strain faced by carers is also a significant concern. Many carers are not eligible for Carer's Allowance, the main benefit available to carers, due to the earnings limit. This means that many carers are unable to claim the financial support they are entitled to, leaving them struggling to make ends meet. Carers Wales is urging the Welsh Government to review the Carer's Allowance earnings limit and to consider increasing it to bring it in line with the Living Wage. This would help to alleviate some of the financial pressure faced by carers and enable them to focus on their caring responsibilities without the added stress of financial hardship. The call for action from Carers Wales comes as the organisation prepares to launch its annual campaign, Carers Week, which runs from 7-13 June. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the challenges faced by carers and to highlight the need for more support and resources to help",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Lana Del Rey: Israel gig 'not a political statement',"The singer has been criticised since announcing her debut performance at the Meteor Festival in Israel, with some people calling it a ""serious mistake"" and urging her to cancel. Lana Del Rey, known for her poetic and introspective lyrics, has remained unapologetic about her decision to perform in Tel Aviv. In a series of tweets, she responded to the backlash, stating, ""I would like to remind you that performing in Tel Aviv is not a political statement or an endorsement of the policies of the Israeli government or the occupation of Palestine. I can only speak to my art and my experience."" Del Rey went on to explain that she had performed in Middle Eastern countries before, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and that she believes in the power of music to bring people together. ""I've played in a lot of places in the Middle East, and I've never had an issue. I believe music is a form of human communication that goes beyond politics and ideology,"" she wrote. The singer's stance has been met with both support and criticism from her fans. Some have praised her for staying true to her art and refusing to be swayed by political pressure, while others have accused her of being insensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people. Del Rey's decision to perform in Israel is not without precedent. Other high-profile artists, including Radiohead and Elton John, have faced similar criticism for performing in the country. Some argue that performing in Israel is a way of engaging with the population and promoting peace and dialogue, while others argue that it is a form of complicity with the Israeli government's policies. Regardless of the debate, it is clear that Lana Del Rey's decision to perform in Israel has sparked a heated conversation about the role of artists in politics and the power of music to bring people together or divide them further.

Wisbech burnt body: Men jailed for killing Mindaugas Arlauskas,"Mindaugas Arlauskas, a 28-year-old Lithuanian national, was discovered by a shocked passer-by in a secluded area of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire on 9 May. The grim find ignited a complex investigation that would ultimately reveal the horrifying truth behind his untimely death. Donatas Umbrasas, a 27-year-old resident of Wisbech, was arrested on suspicion of murder shortly after the discovery. The investigation was in its infancy, but the evidence was mounting against Umbrasas. His initial statement to police was inconsistent, and CCTV footage placed him near the scene of the crime. As the investigation continued, more details began to emerge. Arlauskas and Umbrasas had reportedly known each other for some time, and there were indications of a dispute between the two men. The cause of Arlauskas' death was confirmed to be multiple stab wounds, and it became clear that this was a case of premeditated murder. Umbrasas was eventually charged with the murder of Arlauskas, and his trial began in June. The court heard harrowing testimony from witnesses who described the events leading up to Arlauskas' death. According to their statements, Umbrasas had confronted Arlauskas in a heated argument, during which he produced a knife and inflicted the fatal wounds. Despite the overwhelming evidence against him, Umbrasas maintained his innocence throughout the trial. However, his case was significantly weakened when he admitted to lying to police during their initial interviews. He eventually pleaded guilty to the murder of Arlauskas, sparing himself the possibility of a harsher sentence that could have come from a jury trial. Judge David Farrell, presiding over the case, expressed his sympathy for Arlauskas' family and friends. He noted that the victim had been ""robbed of his life in the most brutal and violent way."" Umbrasas was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 22 years. The trial brought a sense of closure to the Arlauskas family, who had been left devastated by his senseless death. The community of Wisbech was also relieved to see justice served, as the incident had cast a shadow over the town. As Umbrasas was led away to begin his prison sentence, the full horror of his actions came to light. The investigation revealed that Arlauskas had been a hardworking and respected member of the community, while Umbrasas had a history of violence and criminal behaviour. The brutal murder served as a tragic reminder of the consequences of unchecked aggression and violence. The case of Mindaugas Arlauskas' murder served as a sobering reminder of the importance of community safety and the need for swift and effective law enforcement.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The sale of this information could be ""a significant breach of the Data Protection Act 2018,"" the ICO said in a statement. ""We are making enquiries to establish the facts of this case and will be working with other relevant organisations to take appropriate action."" The database, which reportedly contains over 100 million records, includes names, emails, phone numbers, and in some cases, home addresses and dates of birth. The ICO's investigation will focus on how the data was obtained and who was responsible for the breach. The online dating industry has faced increased scrutiny in recent years over data protection concerns. In 2019, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, giving users more control over their online data and imposing stricter rules on companies that collect and process it. Despite this, data breaches and scams continue to plague the industry. In 2018, it was revealed that the dating app, Bumble, had inadvertently exposed the phone numbers of hundreds of thousands of its users. And in 2019, a data leak from the dating site, FriendFinder Networks, exposed the personal information of millions of users. Users of the dating site involved in the latest breach have been advised to take precautions to protect themselves. The ICO recommended that they change their passwords, be wary of unsolicited emails or phone calls, and consider using two-factor authentication on their accounts. The ICO's investigation is a reminder of the importance of data protection, particularly in the age of online dating. ""People's personal information is just that â personal,"" the ICO said. ""It is not a commodity to be bought or sold."" The ICO's statement came as the UK government announced plans to give the regulator new powers to fine companies up to Â£17 million or 4% of their global annual turnover, whichever is greater, for serious data breaches. The new regulations, which are expected to come into force in 2021, are intended to bring the UK's data protection laws in line with those of the European Union. The ICO's investigation into the sale of online dating profiles is ongoing, and it is not yet clear who was responsible for the breach or how the data was obtained. However, the regulator's action serves as a warning to companies in the online dating industry to take data protection seriously and to implement robust security measures to protect their users'",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Fewer cars' as London congestion charge zone cut back,"TfL (Transport for London) announced this week that the congestion charge zone in London has been reduced, leading to fewer cars on the road and a quieter city centre. The zone, which was originally in place from Monday to Friday, between 7am and 6pm, now only operates from Monday to Friday, between 7am and 6.30pm. According to TfL, in the first three months of the year there was also a negligible impact on air quality and minimal change in traffic speeds in the area. The reduction in the number of cars on the road is expected to bring further benefits, such as improved air quality, reduced congestion, and a more pleasant environment for pedestrians and cyclists. The Green Party's Darren Johnson, who has long campaigned for a reduction in the congestion charge zone, welcomed the news. ""This is a significant step in the right direction,"" he said. ""London's air quality is still not where it should be, and reducing the number of cars on the road is one of the most effective ways to improve it. I'm pleased that TfL has listened to the concerns of Londoners and made this change."" However, not everyone is happy with the decision. Some commuters have expressed concern about the impact on their daily lives, particularly those who rely on their cars to get to work. ""I understand the need to reduce congestion and improve air quality, but this is going to make my commute even longer and more difficult,"" said one resident. ""I don't have the option of public transport or cycling, and I can't afford to move closer to my workplace."" The RAC (Royal Automobile Club) has also voiced its concerns, warning that the reduced charging hours could lead to more cars on the road at other times of the day. ""This could result in increased congestion and longer journey times for motorists at peak hours outside of the charging zone,"" said a spokesperson. ""We would urge TfL to consider the wider implications of this change and to provide alternative solutions for those who rely on their cars to get around London."" Despite these concerns, the majority of Londoners seem to be in support of the reduction in the congestion charge zone. A survey conducted by TfL found that 72% of respondents believed that the changes would have a positive impact on their daily lives. ""I think it's a good idea,"" said one respondent. ""I've been trying to reduce my car use and walk or cycle more, and this will make it easier for me to do that."" The reduction in the congestion charge zone is part of a wider package of measures aimed at improving air quality and reducing congestion in London. Other initiatives include the introduction of the Ultra Low Emission Zone, which came into effect in April, and the expansion of the cycle hire scheme.

Charity helps drug addicts set up their own businesses,"By Chris Dearden, BBC News In the quiet town of Bangor, nestled amongst the rolling hills of Wales, a unique rehabilitation programme is helping drug addicts turn their lives around by setting up their own businesses. At Penrhyn House, a residential centre that offers support to those recovering from addiction, residents are learning valuable skills that will not only aid their recovery but also give them a means of earning a livelihood. Some residents at Penrhyn House have set up a carpet cleaning business, using equipment donated by local companies. They offer their services to the community, providing an affordable and reliable alternative to commercial cleaning services. The business not only provides an income for the residents but also offers them a sense of pride and accomplishment. Others are making jams and chutneys or cosmetics from recipes passed down through generations. The produce is sold at local markets and through a community shop, providing an outlet for their products and a source of income for the residents. This not only gives them a financial boost but also allows them to reconnect with their heritage and traditions. The programme, run in partnership with local businesses and charities, provides residents with a safe and supportive environment to learn new skills and build confidence. The businesses are not only a source of income but also serve as a means of social integration, allowing the residents to engage with the community and build relationships. The impact of the programme on the residents is profound. The programme provides them with a sense of purpose and a means of contributing to society. The skills they learn not only help them earn a living but also give them a sense of self-worth. ""This programme has given me a new lease of life,"" said one resident. ""I've learned skills that I can use to support myself and my family. But more than that, it's given me a sense of purpose and a reason to get up in the morning."" The programme is not without its challenges. Funding is a constant concern, and the demand for the services and products far outstrips the supply. But the residents are determined to make it work. They meet regularly to discuss the challenges they face and to find solutions. The success of the programme has not gone unnoticed. Other rehabilitation centres in the region are looking to replicate the model. And the local community is getting behind the programme, offering their support and encouragement. ""This is more than just a rehabilitation programme,"" said one local business owner. ""It's a programme that's helping people turn their lives around and making a real contribution to our community."" As the residents continue to build their businesses and rebuild their lives, the future looks bright. The programme is not just helping individuals recover from addiction, but it's also making a positive impact on the community. And for those who have been through the programme, the skills and experiences they've gained will stay with them for a lifetime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid in Scotland: 'Majority' of criminal trials on hold for lockdown,"Until the end of February, the Scottish courts will prioritize only the ""most serious"" criminal trials to reduce the number of people required to attend court during the ongoing pandemic. The courts service made this announcement, aiming to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 transmission while ensuring the administration of justice. This measure is not new, as similar arrangements have been implemented since last year. However, the prolongation of such restrictions highlights the challenges posed by the pandemic to the legal system. As the virus continues to spread and hospitalizations increase, the focus remains on protecting public health and safety. The implications of this decision are far-reaching, with numerous trials postponed, and some defendants remaining in custody for longer than expected. The delays have the potential to impact the victims, witnesses, and the accused, as well as the broader criminal justice system. Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) President, Lady Dorrian, acknowledged the difficulties that come with the current situation, stating, ""We understand the anxiety caused by trial delays and the impact on victims, witnesses, and defendants. However, public safety must be our top priority."" Judges will use their discretion to determine which cases meet the ""most serious"" criteria. The threshold for such cases is set high, typically involving charges of murder, rape, and other grave offenses. The courts service has implemented various measures to facilitate remote hearings and reduce the number of people attending trials. These include video conferencing for some witness testimony and the use of technology to transmit documents and evidence electronically. However, not all cases can be handled remotely. For trials that do proceed, strict safety protocols will be in place to minimize the risk of infection. These include social distancing, regular testing, and mandatory face masks for all court attendees. Advocates have expressed concern about the impact on the backlog of cases and the potential for lengthy delays. The Law Society of Scotland's criminal law convener, John Scott QC, stated, ""There is a real risk of a significant backlog in the criminal justice system. We urge the courts to prioritize trials where there is a real risk to public safety."" Despite these concerns, the Scottish government remains committed to balancing the need for a functioning criminal justice system with public health and safety. The courts service will continue to review its procedures and adapt to the ever-evolving coronavirus situation. In the meantime, those with ongoing criminal cases are encouraged to stay informed and communicate with their legal representatives. The uncertainty surrounding trial dates and proceedings is undoubtedly challenging, but the focus remains on ensuring public safety while delivering justice.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tulsa shooting: Family of man killed by police call for protests,"Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma, are currently investigating the death of Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old man who was shot and killed by police on Friday evening. According to Crutcher's family, he was unarmed and had his hands in the air at the time of the shooting. Police footage released on Saturday shows Crutcher walking away from officers with his hands up, but he appears to be not complying with their orders. The video does not show the moment when the shots were fired. Crutcher's vehicle reportedly came to a stop in the middle of the road with its hazard lights on before he exited the vehicle. The reason for the initial stop is not clear. Crutcher's family held a press conference on Saturday where they called for protests and demanded answers from the police department. Crutcher's twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher, described her brother as a ""good person"" who was ""very protective"" of his children and loved ones. ""He didn't deserve this,"" Tiffany Crutcher said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""He was a father. He was a son. He was a friend. And he was posing no threat to anyone."" The Tulsa Police Department has released little information about the incident, other than confirming that an officer shot and killed Crutcher. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such cases. The shooting comes at a time of heightened tensions between the African American community and law enforcement, following a string of high-profile police shootings of unarmed black men in recent years. Local activists have called for peaceful protests in response to Crutcher's death. The Tulsa Police Department has asked residents to avoid the area of the shooting for their safety. Crutcher's death has sparked outrage and condemnation from civil rights groups and community leaders. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma called for an independent investigation into the shooting, while the NAACP issued a statement expressing its ""deep concern and sadness"" over the incident. The Tulsa Police Department has promised to release more information about the shooting as it becomes available. In the meantime, Crutcher's family and community members are calling for transparency and accountability from the police department. ""We want to know why he was shot,"" Tiffany Crutcher said. ""Why did they feel threatened by my brother? Why did they feel they had to take his life?"" The shooting has left the Crutcher family and the Tulsa community seeking answers and closure. As the investigation continues, tensions remain high and the call for justice grows louder.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Missing N American couple in 'Taliban' video,"Caitlan Coleman, her voice trembling with emotion, addressed the camera with a desperate plea. Sitting next to her husband, Joshua Boyle, they both looked weary and disheveled, their faces etched with the signs of hardship and suffering. ""My president, Barack Obama,"" Coleman began, her words carrying a sense of urgency that resonated through the small, dimly lit room. ""If you can hear me, please help us. We are the American couple, Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle, and we have been held captive for over three years. We have been shown in this video, and we are asking for your assistance to secure our safe release."" The videos, which were emailed to Coleman's family months after she and Boyle went missing in 2012, had surfaced on social media, causing an uproar among the international community. The couple, both in their late twenties at the time of their disappearance, had been traveling in Afghanistan when they were kidnapped by the Taliban. In the footage, the couple appeared frightened but composed, their eyes darting back and forth as they spoke. Boyle, with a determined look on his face, appealed to the American people and their government for help. ""We implore the United States government to intervene in our behalf,"" he said, his voice barely audible. ""If our government will reach out and negotiate, we could be home by Christmas."" The couple's plea for help came as a relief to their families, who had been praying for their safe return for years. The videos were a grim reminder of the reality that their loved ones had been held captive, and their words served as a glimmer of hope that they could be freed. The Obama administration, however, remained cautious in their response to the situation. Spokesperson Ned Price stated that ""the safety and well-being of American citizens is a top priority for the United States government."" He added that the administration was working closely with Afghan authorities and the couple's families to gather more information about their situation. Despite the administration's assurances, there were concerns that a public appeal for the couple's release could put them at greater risk. Kidnappings for ransom are a lucrative business in Afghanistan, and the Taliban had a history of using such tactics to fund their insurgency. The situation was further complicated by the fact that the Taliban had not specifically identified any demands they had for the couple's release. Some analysts believed that the videos were a propaganda tool, designed to draw attention to the Taliban's continued presence and influence in Afghanistan. Regardless of the motivations behind the videos, the fact remained that Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle were still being held captive, and their families were desperate for answers.

Farage: May 'wilfully deceiving' people over Brexit deal,"The Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, made some bold claims during an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, asserting that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal was, in fact, a ""new European treaty."" In a tense and heated exchange, Mr Farage laid out his case, vowing to take action if his demands were not met. Mr. Farage began by expressing his disappointment with the PM's Brexit deal, stating that it did not go far enough in securing a true Brexit. He criticized the deal's alleged inclusion of the European Court of Justice having any role in the UK, which he saw as a clear violation of sovereignty. ""This is not the Brexit that people voted for,"" Mr Farage declared. ""The British people wanted their country back, and this deal doesn't deliver that. Instead, it appears to be a new European treaty in all but name."" When asked about his intentions should the Conservatives fail to meet his demands, Mr Farage did not mince words. He announced that he would be demanding his party be made part of the government negotiating team if they wished to secure his support. ""I will not sit idly by while the prime minister wilfully deceives the British people,"" Mr Farage said. ""If the Conservatives are serious about getting a Brexit deal that truly represents the will of the people, then they need to listen to the voice of the Brexit Party and bring us to the table."" The interview grew more heated as Mr Marr pressed Mr Farage on the practicality of such a move, given the Conservatives' commanding majority in Parliament. Mr Farage, however, remained steadfast in his position. ""The people have spoken, and they have made it clear that they want a real Brexit,"" Mr Farage argued. ""If the Conservatives refuse to listen, then we will take our case to the people. We will campaign tirelessly, and we will make sure that the voice of the Brexit Party is heard loud and clear."" As the interview drew to a close, it was clear that the Brexit Party leader was determined to hold the Prime Minister accountable to the promises made during the 2016 referendum. The future of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain, and the role of the Brexit Party in shaping the outcome is one that will be closely watched.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Israel eases restrictions following vaccine success,"From Sunday, shops, libraries, and museums in Israel have been given the green light to reopen, marking the first stage of returning to normal life in the country. This significant step comes as Israel continues to lead the world in vaccinations per capita, with over 50% of its population now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The announcement was made by the Israeli health ministry, who emphasized that social distancing and the wearing of masks are still mandatory in all public places. This includes shops, libraries, and museums, where capacity will be limited to ensure that physical distancing can be maintained. The Israeli government's decision to ease restrictions comes as new data shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which makes up the majority of Israel's vaccination rollout, is highly effective in preventing both infection and severe illness. According to the health ministry, those who have been vaccinated are 95% less likely to contract COVID-19 and are also far less likely to be hospitalized if they do contract the virus. Israel's success in vaccinating its population has been attributed to a number of factors, including its robust healthcare system and the government's decision to prioritize vaccinations for the most vulnerable populations. The country has also implemented a highly organized and efficient vaccination campaign, which has seen millions of doses administered in a matter of weeks. Despite the progress being made in vaccinating its population, Israel is not yet out of the woods when it comes to the pandemic. The country has seen a recent spike in cases, particularly among the unvaccinated population. This has led to calls for greater efforts to encourage vaccinations and to enforce public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who took office just over a week ago, has pledged to continue the country's successful vaccination campaign and to work to reopen the economy while keeping the public safe. In a statement, he welcomed the decision to reopen shops, libraries, and museums, but urged the public to remain vigilant and to continue following public health guidelines. ""We are making progress, but we are not out of the woods yet,"" Bennett said. ""We must continue to follow the guidelines and get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities."" The easing of restrictions in Israel is being closely watched by countries around the world, which are looking for signs of how to safely reopen their own economies. While the success of Israel's vaccination campaign has provided some hope, health experts have warned that the pandemic is far from over and that continued vigilance and public health measures will be necessary to prevent further outbreaks. Despite the challenges ahead, Israelis are celebrating the return of some semblance of normal life, with shops, libraries, and museums reopening their doors to the public.

Henry Moore statue: Minister's concerns over sale plan,"Len Tingle, Political Editor, Yorkshire This week, the planned sale of a Henry Moore statue from the grounds of a Yorkshire school has provoked a national outcry, and the lady at the center of the controversy is certainly not going quietly. The sculpture, titled ""Draped Seated Woman,"" has been a cherished feature of the school's grounds for over 50 years, but its future is now uncertain, with the school trustees considering selling it at auction to help with budget deficits. The proposed sale has sparked heated debate, with many arguing that the statue is an important part of the community and should not be sold. This week, there was even a debate in Parliament, and Culture Minister Ed Vaizey made it very clear he was concerned about the potential loss of the artwork. Speaking in the House of Commons, Vaizey said, ""I understand the financial pressures facing schools, but we must also consider the cultural significance of these works. The Henry Moore sculpture at this school is not just an object to be bought and sold; it is an integral part of the community, and its loss would be a great shame."" The Minister's intervention came after a petition to save the statue gathered over 22,000 signatures, and local campaigners vowed to continue their fight to keep the artwork in its current home. The school, which has been in financial difficulties for some time, insisted that the sale was a necessary step to balance the books. However, critics argue that the loss of the statue would be a short-term gain for long-term loss. They point out that the sculpture attracts visitors to the area and boosts tourism, and that the sale proceeds would be unlikely to make a significant dent in the school's financial problems. Supporters of the statue argue that it is an important part of the community, not just for its artistic value but also for the inspiration it provides to students. One local resident, who has lived near the school for over 40 years, said, ""I have watched generations of children grow up with that statue as a backdrop to their lives. It has been a constant presence, and its loss would be a great shame."" The school trustees are due to make a final decision on the sale in the coming weeks, and campaigners have vowed to continue their fight to save the statue. The controversy has highlighted the importance of arts education and the value of public art in communities, and it remains to be seen whether the statue will be saved or lost to the highest bidder. The debate over the sale of the Henry Moore statue is a reminder that art is not just a luxury but a vital part of our communities, providing inspiration, education, and a sense of identity. With the support of local residents, politicians, and art lovers, it is hoped that the statue will be saved and remain a cherished feature of the school's grounds for generations to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
The Indian tribe that gave up hunting to save forests,"At one time, 76-year-old Chaiyievi Zhiinyii was a skilled hunter in the Angami tribe of Nagaland, India. Nestled in the northeastern part of the country, Nagaland is a region rich in biodiversity, with vast forests teeming with wildlife. For generations, the Angami people had relied on hunting and shifting cultivation for their livelihoods. But as Chaiyievi looked around him, he saw that the forests were gradually disappearing. The Angami tribe, known for their strong connection to nature, was facing a dilemma. On one hand, they had hunted for centuries to sustain themselves. On the other hand, they were beginning to realize the impact their activities were having on the environment. In the late 1990s, the tribal elders came to a decision: they would give up hunting to save the forests. Chaiyievi was among the last of the Angami hunters. He stopped hunting in 2001, marking the end of an era for the tribe. It was a significant moment, not just for Chaiyievi, but for the entire Angami community. The decision to give up hunting was not an easy one, as it went against centuries of tradition. But theAngami people understood that the forests were essential for their future. The Angami tribe's decision to give up hunting was part of a larger movement in India to protect forests and wildlife. The Indian government, in collaboration with various NGOs and local communities, has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainable forest management. One such initiative is the Joint Forest Management (JFM) program, which allows local communities to participate in forest management and benefit from forest produce. The Angami people began exploring alternative livelihoods. They turned to agriculture, horticulture, and sericulture (silk production) as sources of income. They also started to explore the potential of ecotourism. The unique culture and beautiful landscapes of Nagaland attracted tourists, and the Angami people were able to generate income by offering homestays and cultural performances. The results of the Angami tribe's efforts have been remarkable. The forests in their region have shown signs of recovery, and the wildlife population has increased. The Angami people have also seen improvements in their standard of living. They have access to better healthcare and education facilities, and they have been able to send their children to schools and colleges. Chaiyievi Zhiinyii, now in his twilight years, looks back on his decision to give up hunting with pride. He knows that he played a small part in a larger movement that has had a significant impact on his tribe and the environment. The Angami people continue to work towards sustainable forest management, and their efforts serve as an inspiration to other communities in India and around the world.

NI political reaction to Birmingham pub bombing apology,"Michael Christopher Hayes, a self-confessed republican bomb-maker, made a shocking admission during a hearing at the Old Bailey on Tuesday. He expressed remorse for his role in the Birmingham pub bombings of 1974, which resulted in the deaths of 21 innocent people. Hayes, who is now in his 60s, was a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) at the time of the attacks. He described the bombings as a ""terrible thing"" and went on to say that ""if I could turn back the clock, I would never have been involved."" The bombs exploded in the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs in Birmingham on November 21, 1974. The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack, which was part of a campaign of violence during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The announcement of Hayes' apology came as a surprise to many, as he had previously maintained his innocence in the bombings. His confession was made during a court hearing related to an unrelated matter. The news of Hayes' apology has sparked a political reaction in Northern Ireland, with some expressing scepticism and others calling for closure and reconciliation. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, issued a statement saying that ""those responsible for the Birmingham pub bombings should face justice."" The party went on to call for ""an end to all investigations and inquests that seek to re-traumatise families and communities."" However, some veterans' groups and political representatives have welcomed Hayes' apology and called for a formal acknowledgement and apology from the Irish government. The families of the victims have also expressed their desire for closure and a recognition of the harm caused by the bombings. The Birmingham pub bombings have long been a source of controversy and division in Northern Ireland. The IRA's campaign of violence during the Troubles resulted in the deaths of over 3,500 people, the majority of whom were civilians. The apology from Michael Christopher Hayes is a small step towards reconciliation and healing, but it is clear that the issues surrounding the Troubles and the effects of violence on communities will continue to be a source of controversy and debate in Northern Ireland for years to come. The announcement of Hayes' apology has also raised questions about the role of the British and Irish governments in the handling of the Troubles and the ongoing investigations into violent incidents from that period. Some have called for a formal acknowledgement of the harm caused by the violence and a commitment to working towards reconciliation and peace. As the political reaction to Hayes' apology continues, it is clear that the legacy of the Troubles and the painful memories of violence and loss will remain a significant challenge for Northern Ireland and its communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rio 2016: 'Welcome to Hell' warn police,"By BBC Trending: What's popular and why As the world's attention focuses on the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, it's important to note that the city's security situation remains a cause for concern. Along with the relatives carrying flowers and taxi drivers waiting with name boards there were lines of off-duty police with banners that had a stark message: ""Welcome to Hell."" The warning comes as Rio's police force grapples with a wave of crime. The city's violent crime rate has soared in recent years, with more than 6,000 violent deaths in 2015 alone. And with the Olympics underway, there are fears that criminal gangs will take advantage of the influx of tourists and international attention. The police union, which represents around 30,000 officers, has been vocal in its criticism of the government's handling of the security situation. Union leader Marcelo Sereno told the BBC that officers are being put at risk due to a lack of resources and support. ""The government doesn't care about our lives,"" he said. ""They don't provide us with the necessary equipment or the manpower to keep the city safe."" The union has called for more troops and police to be deployed on the streets during the Olympics, but the government has refused, citing budget constraints. Instead, they have relied on the deployment of military personnel to help secure the games. But even with the military presence, there have been reports of violence and crime. On the opening day of the Olympics, there were clashes between police and protesters, resulting in several injuries. And just a few days later, a gunman opened fire on a bus carrying athletes, injuring at least 16 people. The Olympics are meant to be a time of unity and celebration, but for many in Rio, they are a reminder of the daily struggle against crime and violence. And as the games come to a close, there are fears that the situation will only get worse. The police union has called for a march to be held on the final day of the Olympics, to draw attention to the city's security crisis. It's a sobering reminder that, for many in Rio, the games are far from a welcome distraction from the realities of everyday life. Instead, they are a stark reminder of the challenges that the city and its people face, both during and after the Olympics. As the world watches the Olympics unfold, it's important to remember that Rio's security situation is far from over. And with the city's police force stretched to its limits, it's clear that more needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of its residents and visitors. In the meantime, the warnings of ""Welcome to Hell"" are a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead.

Oxford Covered Market rent hike defended,"A petition to ""Save The Oxford Covered Market"" has gathered more than 8,000 signatures since it started in March. The council said rents were currently ""very low,"" but recent proposals to increase them have sparked fierce opposition from market traders and local residents. Oxford City Council announced plans to hike rents by up to 30% for some stalls in the historic market, which has been a fixture of the city since 1774. The decision comes as part of a wider regeneration project in the area, which includes the development of new housing and retail spaces. The proposed rent increases have been met with anger and disbelief from market traders, who argue that the hikes will force many of them out of business. ""We've been here for years, and we've built up a loyal customer base,"" said one trader, who asked to remain anonymous. ""A 30% rent increase is just not feasible for us. We'll have to pass the costs on to our customers, or we'll have to close up shop."" Local residents have also voiced their concerns, with some arguing that the market is an essential part of Oxford's cultural heritage. ""The Covered Market is a vital part of Oxford's identity,"" said one resident. ""It's not just a place to buy fresh produce or a cup of coffee â it's a community hub. If the rents go up, we risk losing so much more than just a few stalls."" The council has defended the rent hikes, arguing that they are necessary to bring the market in line with modern market rents and to ensure its long-term viability. ""The Covered Market is a valuable asset to the city, and we want to make sure it continues to thrive,"" said a spokesperson for the council. ""We understand that these rent increases may be challenging for some traders, but we're committed to working with them to find a solution that works for everyone."" The council has also promised to provide support to traders who may struggle to pay the new rents, including business advice and grant funding. However, many traders remain skeptical, arguing that the financial support on offer is insufficient. The petition to save the Oxford Covered Market has gained momentum in recent days, with celebrity supporters including actress Emma Watson and Oxford United footballer Gavin Whyte lending their weight to the cause. The council has said it will consider the petition's findings before making a final decision on the rent increases. Despite the uncertainty, market traders and local residents remain determined to fight for the future of the Covered Market. ""We're not going to let this happen without a fight,"" said one trader. ""This market has been here for over 240 years, and we're not going to let it disappear now.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Dog microchipping to be compulsory in Wales by 2015,"The move is seen as a way to improve animal welfare and develop responsible dog ownership by helping identify strays and ensuring the safe return of lost pets. It is estimated that over 5,000 dogs go missing in Wales each year, with many never being reunited with their owners. The new legislation, which will come into effect in 2015, will require all dogs in Wales to be microchipped and the details kept up to date. The Welsh Government has announced that it will make microchipping compulsory for all dogs in the country, in a bid to reduce the number of stray dogs and improve animal welfare. The move follows similar legislation in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The new law will require all dogs to be microchipped by the age of eight weeks, and their owners will be responsible for keeping the details up to date. Failure to comply with the legislation could result in fines. The Welsh Government has emphasized that the new law is not intended to be punitive, but rather a way to promote responsible dog ownership and improve animal welfare. By ensuring that all dogs are microchipped, the authorities will be able to quickly identify the owners of any stray dogs, and take appropriate action. The British Veterinary Association (BVA) has welcomed the new legislation, stating that it will help to reduce the number of dogs being put down each year due to being unidentified strays. According to the BVA, over 4,000 dogs are put down every year in the UK because their owners cannot be found. The RSPCA has also expressed its support for the new law, stating that it will help to prevent the suffering of thousands of dogs each year. The charity has urged dog owners to take the opportunity to get their pets microchipped as soon as possible, to ensure they are compliant with the new legislation. The microchipping process is a simple and painless procedure, involving the insertion of a small chip, no larger than a grain of rice, under the skin of the dog's neck. The chip is then scanned using a special reader, which displays the unique identification number. The new legislation is expected to come into effect in 2015, and the Welsh Government has announced that it will be providing funding to help cover the costs of microchipping for those on low incomes. The government has also stated that it will be working with local authorities and veterinary practices to ensure that the new law is implemented effectively and fairly. In conclusion, the new legislation requiring compulsory microchipping for all dogs in Wales is a positive step towards improving animal welfare and promoting responsible dog ownership. It will help to ensure that lost dogs are quickly reunited with their owners, and reduce the number of stray dogs and unidentified strays being put down each year. The Welsh Government has provided funding to help cover the costs for those on low incomes, and has emphasized that the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Iran nuclear deal: Rouhani says West has no right to make changes,"The US and French leaders announced on Tuesday that they were working on a ""new deal"" that would expand and extend the terms of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord. This news came as a surprise to many, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani swiftly responding to the announcement. Speaking to reporters in Tehran, Rouhani made it clear that Iran would not stand for any changes to the existing deal, which saw Iran limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. ""The JCPOA is a multilateral agreement, not a bilateral one between Iran and the US,"" Rouhani said. ""The West, including the US, has no right to make unilateral changes to the deal."" Rouhani went on to remind the US and its European allies that the nuclear deal was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council and that any changes would need to be approved by all parties involved. ""We will not allow anyone to violate the provisions of the JCPOA under the guise of extending it,"" Rouhani said. The Iranian president's comments came as tensions between Iran and the West have been rising in recent months. The US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and has since reimposed sanctions on Iran, aiming to force the country to negotiate a new deal that would address what the US sees as Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East. Iran, for its part, has responded by increasing its uranium enrichment levels beyond the limits set by the deal, in a move intended to pressure the West to lift the sanctions. The European signatories to the deal, meanwhile, have been working to keep the accord alive, but have struggled to find a way to provide Iran with the economic benefits it was promised without violating US sanctions. Despite these challenges, Rouhani continued to express a willingness to engage in diplomacy with the West. ""We have always been open to diplomacy and negotiations,"" he said. ""But any negotiations must be based on respect for international law and the JCPOA."" Rouhani also cautioned against the dangers of military action against Iran. ""War will bring nothing but destruction and suffering for the people of the region,"" he said. ""It is time for the international community to work together to find a peaceful solution to the issues between Iran and the West."" As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the US and its European allies will respond to Rouhani's comments. One thing is clear, however: the Iran nuclear deal remains a contentious issue that is likely to continue to dominate headlines in the coming days and weeks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Protected status for flapper skate 'nursery' off Skye,"The flapper skate ""nursery"" in Skye's Inner Sound is a significant discovery for marine conservationists. This unique ecosystem, which is home to the small, flat-bodied skate fish, is set to receive protected status from 17 March. The females of this species can grow up to an impressive 2.8m (9ft) in length, making them a valuable addition to the marine life of the Scottish waters. The Marine Protected Area (MPA) designation comes as a result of extensive research and surveys conducted by the Scottish Government in collaboration with the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) and other stakeholders. The findings revealed that the Inner Sound of Skye provides an essential habitat for the flapper skate, with high concentrations of juveniles and females residing in this area. The decision to establish a protected area for the flapper skate is a crucial step towards ensuring the long-term survival of this species. Overfishing and accidental bycatch have posed significant threats to the population of flapper skates in recent times. With the MPA designation, activities such as commercial fishing, dredging, and bottom trawling will be prohibited within the designated area, allowing the skates to thrive without human intervention. The protected status for the flapper skate nursery also holds broader implications for the marine ecosystem as a whole. The Inner Sound of Skye is an important feeding and breeding ground for a diverse range of marine species. By protecting the flapper skate population, conservationists hope to preserve the delicate balance of the local ecosystem and promote the recovery of other endangered species. Moreover, the MPA designation is a testament to the Scottish Government's commitment to marine conservation. Scotland is home to some of the richest marine habitats in Europe, and the establishment of protected areas is a crucial step towards safeguarding these precious resources for future generations. Marine scientists are optimistic about the potential benefits of the protected area for the flapper skate population. ""The establishment of this MPA is a significant milestone for marine conservation in Scotland,"" says Dr. Jane Watson, a marine biologist at SAMS. ""We hope that this will provide a safe haven for the flapper skate population to recover and thrive, and contribute to the overall health of the Inner Sound ecosystem."" As the 17 March deadline approaches, marine conservationists and local stakeholders are working together to raise awareness about the importance of the protected area and the role that each individual can play in preserving the marine environment. With renewed efforts to protect Scotland's marine resources and a growing appreciation for the importance of biodiversity, the future looks promising for the flapper skate and the rich marine ecosystem of Skye's Inner Sound.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
How many migrant children cross the English Channel?,"By William McLennan, BBC News More than 7,400 people have stepped into small boats and navigated one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world to reach the south coast of England in 2020. At least six people are now thought to have lost their lives making the perilous journey across the English Channel. But what about the children among them? According to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, more than 3,000 unaccompanied children are believed to have crossed the Channel this year, up from around 1,500 in 2019. These figures are based on Home Office data and official estimates from France. The reasons for this significant increase are complex and multifaceted. Push factors in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria continue to drive people to seek safety in Europe. Pull factors, such as the UK's asylum system and its reputation for offering a more generous welfare system, also play a role. The journey itself is fraught with danger. Small boats are often overcrowded and unseaworthy. In stormy weather, the Channel can be deadly. Children are particularly vulnerable. They may be travelling alone or with adults who are not their parents. They may have experienced trauma and loss. Once they reach the UK, unaccompanied children are placed in care while their asylum claims are processed. In some cases, they may be reunited with family members already living in the UK. But the care system is under strain and there are concerns about the quality of care and the length of time children spend in it. The UK government has faced criticism for its handling of the issue. In October, Home Secretary Priti Patel was accused of using ""hostile environment"" language towards migrants. Critics argue that such language creates a hostile atmosphere and makes it harder for vulnerable children to access the support they need. In response to the growing number of child migrants, the government has announced plans to expand the use of ""safe and legal"" routes to the UK. This includes increasing the number of places available for unaccompanied children under the Dubs Amendment, which allows for the transfer of unaccompanied children from Europe to the UK. But there are concerns that these measures do not go far enough. Some argue that the UK needs to do more to address the root causes of migration and to provide safe and legal routes for people to seek asylum in Europe. Others call for a more compassionate and welcoming approach to migrant children. As the number of child migrants continues to rise, the UK faces a moral and practical challenge. How do we ensure that these vulnerable children are kept safe and given the support they need? How do we respond with compassion and humanity to those who have been forced to flee their homes and embark on a perilous journey across the Channel?

"Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat","Kamal Ahmed @bbc economics editor The present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes. And that's putting it mildly. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the European Union has weighed heavily on businesses, leading to investment being put on hold and companies preparing for the possibility of no deal. But what if that ""no deal"" Brexit threat becomes a reality? What would that mean for the UK economy and for people's lives? Let's start with trade. In the absence of a deal, the UK would revert to World Trade Organization rules, meaning tariffs would be imposed on goods traded between the UK and EU. This would lead to higher prices for consumers and potentially damage industries that rely on exports to Europe, such as the car industry and agriculture. The UK's service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, would also be affected. Financial services, for example, could lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without the need for a local presence. This would mean more red tape and potentially higher costs for firms. Then there's the question of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to the region, relies on the free movement of people and goods. A no-deal Brexit would mean the imposition of a hard border, with all the potential tensions and problems that comes with it. But it's not just about trade and borders. A no-deal Brexit would also mean the UK would no longer be subject to EU rules and regulations. This could lead to a patchwork of regulations, with different rules applying in different parts of the UK. This would create uncertainty for businesses and potentially lead to increased costs. And let's not forget about the impact on people's lives. A no-deal Brexit would mean an end to freedom of movement, which could lead to difficulties for UK citizens living in the EU and for EU citizens living in the UK. It could also mean an end to the UK's participation in EU programmes such as Erasmus, which allows students to study abroad. So what can be done to mitigate the damage of a no-deal Brexit? The government could prepare for the possibility of no deal by putting in place measures to support businesses and individuals. This could include providing financial assistance to firms that are particularly reliant on EU markets, as well as providing advice and guidance to individuals about what they need to do to prepare for Brexit. But ultimately, the best way to avoid the negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be to reach a deal. The EU and the UK are in negotiations, and while progress has been slow, there is still time for a deal to be reached.

Ian Paisley challenges BBC over Maldives 'wrongdoing' evidence,"He was speaking for the first time since a BBC Spotlight programme aired allegations that he, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster, had paid for part of a 2012 fact-finding trip to the Maldives, contrary to previous statements. ""If the BBC think I have done anything wrong, all the facts and evidence they have are in my hands,"" Ian Paisley boldly declared at a press conference in Belfast. ""I challenge the BBC to produce any concrete evidence that I, or indeed Arlene Foster, engaged in any wrongdoing during that trip or in the years that followed."" Paisley, a prominent DUP politician, and Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, have been under scrutiny since the BBC report. The programme claimed that the ministers had accepted a free holiday worth around Â£1,000 each, which they had previously denied. The allegations have raised questions about transparency and ethical conduct in Northern Irish politics. ""I have always been open and transparent about my finances,"" Paisley continued, his voice steady. ""I have nothing to hide. The facts will show that this was a legitimate fact-finding mission, funded in part by the Maldivian government and in part by a charitable trust. I did not, and I certainly did not ask for, any personal financial gain from this trip."" Paisley went on to criticise the BBC for what he described as a ""witch hunt"" against him and Foster. ""This is a smear campaign, pure and simple,"" he said. ""The BBC have no concrete evidence, no facts, and yet they continue to spread these unfounded allegations. It is a disgrace, and it is an affront to the democratic process."" Despite the controversy, Paisley remained defiant. He reiterated his call for the BBC to produce evidence to back up their claims. ""I am not afraid of scrutiny,"" he said. ""I have nothing to fear, and I welcome transparency. But I will not stand idly by while my reputation is dragged through the mud based on unsubstantiated allegations."" The DUP politician also used the opportunity to turn the tables on the BBC. ""The real question here is not about me or Arlene Foster,"" he said. ""It is about the BBC and their journalistic standards. How can they make such serious allegations without any concrete evidence? It is a breach of trust and an abuse of the power that comes with being a public broadcaster."" Paisley's press conference was met with a mixed response. Some saw his defiance as a sign of strength, while others were unconvinced by his denials. The controversy is likely to rumble on, with calls for an independent investigation into the matter and renewed scrutiny of Northern Irish politics.

Billy Caldwell: Campaigner's company sells cannabis oil,"Charlotte Caldwell's world came crashing down once again as she and her son Billy, 12, were met with the familiar sight of British border control officers confiscating their cannabis oil at Heathrow Airport. The Caldwells had travelled from their home in Northern Ireland to London in search of a new supply of the life-saving medication, which had run out. Billy, who has Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy, had been using cannabis oil since 2016. The oil, which contains high levels of CBD and only traces of THC, had been providing him with much-needed relief from his debilitating seizures. However, under UK law, cannabis remains a Class B drug, making it illegal to possess or import. Despite the risks, Charlotte had grown tired of watching her son suffer through seizure after seizure, and was determined to find a way to get the medication he needed. She had even set up her own company, Charlotte's Web, to import and distribute the cannabis oil. But despite her best efforts, the constant threat of confiscation loomed over them. ""I'm just a mum doing what I have to do for my son,"" Charlotte told the BBC. ""I've tried everything else. He's had every medication going, he's been in hospital numerous times. This is the only thing that works for him."" With the help of her supporters and campaigners, Charlotte had managed to secure a temporary import licence from the Home Office in 2018, allowing her to bring a small supply of cannabis oil into the UK without fear of seizure. But this licence had since expired, leaving the Caldwells in a precarious position. ""I know it's illegal, but I'm not a criminal,"" Charlotte continued. ""I'm a mum, and I'll do whatever it takes to give my son a normal life. He deserves that."" Billy's story had captured the hearts and minds of the public, with many calling for a change in the law to allow for the use of medicinal cannabis. Campaigners, including the actor and activist Stephen Fry, had thrown their support behind the Caldwells, urging the government to take action. But progress had been slow, with the Home Office maintaining its hardline stance on the issue. In the meantime, families like the Caldwells continued to live in fear, knowing that one seizure could mean the difference between life and death for their loved ones. ""I just want to be able to live my life without the constant worry that we'll be arrested or have our medication taken away from us,"" Charlotte said, tears in her eyes. ""I want Billy to be able to grow up and live a normal life, free from seizures and the fear of what might happen next."" As Charlotte",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Calls for more openness over enterprise zone jobs,"More than 5,100 jobs have been created or safeguarded over the past two years in Wales' enterprise zones, according to the latest figures from the Welsh Government. But Plaid Cymru, the opposition party in the Welsh Assembly, has complained that the public has a ""right to know more"" about the jobs being created and the companies benefiting from the tax incentives. The Welsh Government has defended its record, stating that the enterprise zones are an essential part of its economic recovery plan. The zones offer businesses reduced rates of business rates, simplified planning processes, and other incentives for up to 25 years. However, Plaid Cymru's shadow economy minister, Sian Gwenllian, has criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the jobs being created and the companies benefiting from the scheme. In a statement, she said: ""The Welsh Government must be more open about the number and nature of jobs being created in the enterprise zones, and the companies that are receiving public subsidies. The public has a right to know how their money is being spent and what benefits they are getting in return."" Ms Gwenllian also raised concerns over the long-term sustainability of the jobs being created. She said: ""We welcome the creation of new jobs, but we want to ensure that they are good quality, well-paid jobs that offer prospects for the future. We also want to see more investment in local supply chains, to create a ripple effect of economic activity in the communities surrounding the enterprise zones."" The Welsh Government has responded by stating that it is working closely with businesses to ensure that the jobs being created are of high quality and offer good prospects for workers. A spokesperson said: ""Our enterprise zones are an important part of our economic recovery plan, and we are committed to working with businesses to create sustainable jobs that offer long-term prospects for workers. We will continue to be transparent about the jobs being created and the companies benefiting from the scheme."" But Plaid Cymru is not alone in its demands for greater transparency. The Wales TUC has also called for more information about the jobs being created and the companies benefiting from the enterprise zones. In a statement, General Secretary Shavanah Taj said: ""The Welsh Government must be more open about the jobs being created in the enterprise zones. We welcome the creation of new jobs, but we want to ensure that they are good quality, well-paid jobs that offer prospects for the future. We also want to see more investment in local supply chains, to create a ripple effect of economic activity in the communities surrounding the enterprise zones."" The debate over transparency and the impact of enterprise zones on local communities is likely to continue as the Welsh Government continues its economic recovery plan.

Tintin and the vanishing murals: Brussels races to save art,"By Daniel Curtis, BBC News, Brussels In the early 1920s, HergÃ©, then a 15-year-old Georges Remi, was a scout and student at Institut St Boniface, in the Ixelles area of Brussels. It was here that his enduring fascination with art began. Little did he know that decades later, the city he loved would race against time to save some of its most precious works. Today, Ixelles is an eclectic mix of Art Nouveau, Art Deco and modernist architecture, but back then, it was a quiet, affluent neighbourhood. HergÃ©'s artistic prowess was recognised early, and he would often be sent to sketch the local street scenes. One day, while wandering through the Rue ArchimÃ¨de, he came across something extraordinary - a mural depicting the Battle of Waterloo. The mural, which stretched over 100 metres, was a masterpiece of its time. Created in the late 19th century, it was a testament to the city's rich history and its connection to the famous battle that had taken place just a few kilometres away. Over the years, however, the mural fell into disrepair. By the time HergÃ© discovered it, large sections had been covered in graffiti, and the remaining parts were weathered and faded. Fast forward to the present day, and the mural, along with several other historic murals in Brussels, is under threat. The city's urban regeneration programme, which includes the renovation of numerous buildings, is inadvertently causing damage to these valuable works of art. According to experts, the murals are deteriorating at an alarming rate, and if action is not taken soon, they could be lost forever. The race is on to save the murals. A team of conservationists, historians and local residents have come together to raise awareness of the issue and to find a solution. One idea is to move the murals to a new location, where they can be preserved and protected from the elements. Another proposal is to integrate them into new buildings, ensuring their survival while also contributing to the city's modern architectural landscape. As the campaign gains momentum, Brussels is being reminded of its artistic heritage. The murals are not just historical relics; they are an integral part of the city's identity. They tell the story of Brussels, its past, its present and its future. With the help of the community, the authorities and the experts, it is hoped that these murals, including the one that inspired a young HergÃ©, will be saved for future generations to enjoy. In the meantime, HergÃ©'s legacy lives on. The Tintin comic series, which he created in the 1930s, has become a cultural phenomenon.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sarwar and Baillie out in Scottish Labour reshuffle,"Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie, two prominent Scottish Labour figures, have been shuffled out of their respective spokesperson roles in a reshuffle following the party's disappointing performance in the recent Scottish Parliament elections. Anas Sarwar, who lost to Richard Leonard in last year's leadership contest, has been replaced as health spokesperson by Monica Lennon. Sarwar, who gained a reputation as a talented communicator and a passionate advocate for health issues during his time as health spokesperson, expressed his disappointment at the decision but pledged his continued support to the party. Ms Baillie, who backed Sarwar in the leadership contest, has lost her role as the party's economy spokeswoman. Baillie, a veteran politician with a reputation for her economic expertise, was a key figure in Labour's economic team during the previous parliament and was seen as a potential successor to Sarwar in the leadership contest. Her departure from the frontbench is a blow to the party, and her loss of influence in economic policy is a significant development. The reshuffle comes amid calls for Labour to rebuild and rebrand itself following its poor showing in the elections. The party won just 24 seats, its worst result since devolution in 1999, and lost ground in traditional heartlands. Leader Richard Leonard has promised a ""root and branch"" review of the party's election defeat, and the shuffle is seen as an attempt to bring in new blood and fresh perspectives. However, the decision to replace Sarwar and Baillie, both of whom are experienced and well-regarded politicians, has raised eyebrows among some Labour supporters. Some have criticised the move as a needless purge of talented individuals and a missed opportunity to build on the party's existing strengths. Others have suggested that the reshuffle is an attempt to appease Labour's left-wing faction, who have been critical of Sarwar and Baillie's more moderate approach. Regardless of the motivations behind the reshuffle, it is clear that Labour faces a significant challenge in rebuilding and rebranding itself in the aftermath of its election defeat. The departure of Sarwar and Baillie, two of the party's most talented and experienced figures, is a setback, but it also presents an opportunity for new voices and fresh ideas to emerge. Only time will tell whether the reshuffle will help Labour to turn the corner and regain the trust of Scottish voters.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pisa literacy survey: Finland loses top spot to Asians,"The tri-annual Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) survey of 15-year-olds once again placed Finland at the top of the literacy charts. However, this time around, the Nordic country was dethroned by an unexpected contender - the Shanghai region of China. The survey, which measures reading, mathematical, and scientific literacy, revealed that Shanghai's students scored the highest in reading, with an average of 553 points, outperforming even Finland's top-scoring region, which came in second with a score of 550 points. Finland's education minister, Li Andersson, expressed her concerns over the results, particularly the decline in reading ability among Finnish boys. ""We have seen a drop in reading skills among our boys in recent years,"" she said. ""This is not something we take lightly, and we will be taking immediate action to address this issue."" The Pisa survey also highlighted significant disparities within individual countries. In Finland, for instance, the gap between the highest and lowest-performing students was the largest among all participating countries. This disparity, according to Andersson, is a cause for concern as it could potentially widen the divide between socio-economic groups. Asian countries, including China, Singapore, and Hong Kong, dominated the top spots in the survey, with Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore taking the top three positions in both reading and science. The Asian region's success can be attributed to various factors, including a strong focus on education, rigorous teaching methods, and a high value placed on academic achievement. However, not all Asian countries performed equally well. Japan, for instance, which historically has had strong educational systems, saw a decline in its rankings in both reading and mathematics. The country's education minister, Koichi Hagiuda, acknowledged the results and promised reforms to address the issue. The Pisa survey results serve as a reminder of the importance of investing in education and addressing disparities within individual countries. The challenge for countries like Finland, which have previously enjoyed high rankings, is to adapt and innovate to maintain their competitiveness in the global education landscape. For other countries, the survey results provide valuable insights into best practices and areas for improvement. Regardless of the outcomes, the Pisa survey continues to be a powerful catalyst for change and a call to action for governments, educators, and policymakers around the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lithuania country profile,"Not much more than a decade after it regained its independence during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, Lithuania was welcomed as a new member of the international community. The small Baltic nation had endured more than five centuries of foreign rule, but its resilient people had managed to preserve their rich cultural heritage. Lithuania's geographical location at the easternmost edge of Europe, between Poland and Latvia, gave it a unique history and identity. Its largest city, Vilnius, was once the grand capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a powerful state that extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea in the Middle Ages. The city's Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a living testament to this history, with its cobblestone streets, baroque architecture, and vibrant cultural scene. Lithuania's economy, however, was in a state of transition. The country had to rebuild its infrastructure and institutions from scratch after decades of Soviet rule. It embraced market reforms and joined the European Union in 2004, which brought it significant investment and economic opportunities. Today, Lithuania is a modern, open society that values education, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The country's natural beauty is another draw for visitors. Lithuania has more than a thousand lakes, making it a popular destination for nature lovers and water sports enthusiasts. Its forests cover more than one-third of the country, providing a habitat for diverse flora and fauna. The Curonian Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a unique and stunning landscape of sand dunes, forests, and beaches. Lithuania's people are known for their hospitality and warmth. They are proud of their heritage and eager to share it with the world. Lithuanian cuisine, influenced by its location and history, offers a delicious and diverse range of flavors. From hearty potato dishes to savory smoked fish, there is something for everyone. Lithuania's cultural scene is vibrant and diverse. Its traditional music, dance, and folklore are celebrated and passed down from generation to generation. The country is also home to many modern art galleries, theaters, and music festivals. The annual Vilnius Jazz Festival, for instance, attracts jazz enthusiasts from around the world. Despite its small size, Lithuania has a rich and complex history that continues to shape its identity today. Its people have endured hardships and emerged stronger and more resilient.

Spyware use in domestic violence 'escalating',"By Zoe Kleinman, Technology reporter, BBC News Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under Â£50 and are easy to install, says the Digital-Trust. These gadgets, also known as spyware, are increasingly being used in domestic violence cases to monitor and control victims, according to experts and charities. The covert use of spyware to spy on partners or ex-partners is not a new phenomenon. But the ease of access to these devices and their increasing functionality has led to a surge in reports of domestic abuse cases involving such technology. A report by the Women's Aid charity in the UK revealed that over 50% of women who had experienced domestic abuse were subjected to surveillance or monitoring. Spyware was used to track victims' locations, monitor their emails and social media activity, and even listen in on their conversations. The use of spyware in domestic violence cases is particularly insidious as it allows perpetrators to maintain control over their victims even when they are not physically present. This can lead to a heightened sense of fear and anxiety, as victims are constantly monitored and their every move is tracked. The availability of spyware is not the only concern. The use of such technology also raises serious ethical and legal questions. Installing spyware on someone else's device without their consent is a violation of their privacy and can be a criminal offence. But the complexity of these devices and the ease with which they can be obtained online makes it difficult for victims to know if they have been targeted. And even if they suspect they are being monitored, they may be reluctant to report it for fear of retaliation or further violence. Technology companies and law enforcement agencies are working to raise awareness of the issue and to develop ways to detect and prevent the use of spyware in domestic violence cases. But it is a challenging problem, as the technology is constantly evolving and new devices and methods of surveillance are emerging all the time. The Digital-Trust, a UK-based charity that provides advice and support to victims of online abuse, is calling for greater action to be taken to tackle the issue. They are urging governments, technology companies, and charities to work together to raise awareness of the issue, to develop effective ways to detect and prevent the use of spyware, and to provide support and resources to victims. In the meantime, victims of domestic abuse are being urged to take steps to protect themselves. This includes changing passwords regularly, avoiding clicking on unknown links or downloading unknown software, and being cautious about who they share their personal information with. But ultimately, the solution to the problem lies in addressing the root cause of domestic abuse â the attitudes and behaviours that allow it to persist. This requires a collective effort from individuals, communities, and governments to challenge the norms that perpetuate violence and to support victims and survivors.

Energy firm's Cheshire plans refused by councillors,"Cheshire West and Chester Council's planning committee delivered a significant blow to IGas, a prominent energy firm, as they voted 10 to 1 to reject the company's plans for Ellesmere Port. This decision comes amidst growing concerns over climate change and the potential environmental impact of fracking. Anti-fracking campaigner Matt Bryan, who has long been vocal in his opposition to IGas's proposed project, hailed the committee's decision as a victory for the community. ""IGas has failed to address the significant climate change concerns associated with their proposals,"" Bryan stated. ""Fracking is a dirty and outdated technology that is completely at odds with the UK's commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."" IGas, which had hoped to extract shale gas from the site using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, had previously claimed that the project would create jobs and generate revenue for the local economy. However, opponents argue that the potential economic benefits do not outweigh the risks, particularly in the context of the climate crisis. Bryan continued, ""The climate emergency is a global crisis that demands urgent action. We cannot afford to continue extracting and burning fossil fuels, and that is exactly what IGas was planning to do in Ellesmere Port."" He went on to express his gratitude to the planning committee for putting the future of the planet ahead of short-term economic gains. The campaigner also highlighted the potential risks to public health and the environment, which have been a source of contention throughout the planning process. ""Fracking has been linked to a range of health issues, from respiratory problems to increased risk of cancer,"" Bryan explained. ""Additionally, the process requires large amounts of water and the use of toxic chemicals, which can contaminate groundwater and harm wildlife."" IGas has not yet commented on the council's decision, but it is anticipated that the company may appeal the ruling. In the meantime, campaigners are calling on the government to finally acknowledge the scientific consensus on the risks of fracking and to invest in renewable energy instead. ""We need to transition to a clean energy future, and that means leaving fossil fuels in the ground,"" Bryan concluded. ""The people of Ellesmere Port have spoken, and it's time for IGas and the government to listen.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Did Boris Johnson just announce an election without actually doing so?,"Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurakun, Political editor He's always said that he really doesn't want to go to the country again. Downing Street is still absolutely adamant that there will be no election this side of Christmas, despite mounting speculation and pressure from within his own party. But Boris Johnson's unexpected announcement of a ""major statement"" in the House of Commons on Wednesday has left many questioning whether the prime minister might have just dropped a hint about an imminent election without actually saying the words. Johnson's statement, which came after a tumultuous few days for the government, was billed as an update on coronavirus measures and the economic response to the pandemic. But, as is often the case with Johnson, there was a subtlety to his words that left some observers believing he might be laying the groundwork for an election. ""We will continue to work night and day to take this country forward and to unite and level up,"" Johnson told MPs, before adding, ""but I have to level with you, we cannot go on like this."" Johnson's use of the phrase ""we cannot go on like this"" has been interpreted by some as a veiled reference to the ongoing political instability, which has seen the prime minister's government lose several key votes in recent weeks. And with the opposition parties increasingly calling for a general election, Johnson's statement has fuelled further speculation that he might be preparing to go to the polls. Downing Street, however, insists that there are no plans for an election just yet. A senior source close to the prime minister told the BBC that Johnson's statement was ""absolutely not"" an election announcement, but rather a chance for him to update MPs on the government's progress in tackling the pandemic and the economy. But with the prime minister's approval ratings continuing to slide, and the opposition parties growing increasingly confident that they can capitalise on public discontent, some believe that Johnson might be leaving himself an out if he decides to call an election in the coming weeks. It's important to note that Johnson would need a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons to call a snap election without a vote. With the opposition parties united in their opposition to an early poll, it's unlikely that Johnson would be able to secure the necessary votes. But with the political landscape constantly shifting, and Johnson's penchant for the unexpected, nothing can be ruled out completely. So, while the prime minister may not have actually announced an election on Wednesday, his statement has certainly left the door open for one in the near future. And with the political stakes higher than ever, and the coronavirus crisis continuing to dominate the headlines, the next few weeks are likely to be a rollercoaster ride for British politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Amsterdam copies Cardiff's approach to reducing violence,"Amsterdam, the vibrant Dutch city famed for its picturesque canals and liberal culture, is now adopting an innovative approach to reduce violence, drawing inspiration from Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar-sized UK cities. The strategy works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as specific locations, times, and even the types of perpetrators. This intelligence is then shared with local authorities, community leaders, and other relevant organizations, enabling them to take targeted action to prevent further violence. Professor Martyn Lloyd-Kennedy, an expert in criminal justice and community safety at Cardiff University, has been instrumental in developing this approach. He believes that involving victims in the process is crucial, as they often hold vital information that can help prevent future violence. Amsterdam's mayor, Femke Halsema, has announced that the city will be implementing this approach, with a particular focus on high-crime areas and communities that have been disproportionately affected by violence. The city's police force and social services will be working closely with local residents and community groups to gather information, build trust, and implement effective interventions. The approach is based on the principle of community engagement and empowerment. By involving victims and local communities in the prevention of violence, the city hopes to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, as well as build stronger, more cohesive communities. The success of this approach in Cardiff has been well-documented. Since its implementation, the city has seen a significant reduction in violence, particularly in areas that were previously hotspots. In addition, there has been a noticeable increase in community engagement and civic pride, as residents feel that they are being listened to and their concerns are being addressed. Amsterdam's adoption of this approach is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing complex social issues. By learning from the experiences of other cities and adapting successful strategies to their own context, Amsterdam hopes to create a safer, more peaceful city for all its residents. However, it is important to note that this approach is not a silver bullet. It requires a sustained effort from all stakeholders, as well as a commitment to addressing the root causes of violence, such as poverty, inequality, and social exclusion. As Amsterdam embarks on this journey, it can look to Cardiff for guidance and inspiration. The Welsh capital's success story serves as a powerful reminder that by working together and harnessing the collective intelligence of communities, it is possible to create safer, more peaceful cities for everyone.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rhino poaching: South Africa and Vietnam sign deal,"The price of rhino horn, a prized commodity in traditional Asian medicine, has soared to record heights, fuelling an illegal poaching epidemic that threatens the survival of this iconic species. Rhino poaching is already banned under international conventions, but figures show the number of rhinos killed in South Africa alone in 2012 was a shocking 668. This represents an alarming 21% increase from the previous year. In a bid to combat this transnational crime, South Africa and Vietnam signed a historic memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 28 October 2021. The MOU aims to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in the fight against rhino poaching and the illegal trade of rhino horn. South African Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy, expressed her commitment to working with Vietnam to address the root causes of this issue. ""The illegal trade in rhino horn is a complex problem that requires a multifaceted approach. This MOU represents a significant step forward in our efforts to combat this transnational crime,"" she said. Vietnamese Ambassador to South Africa, Nguyen Quoc Dung, emphasised the importance of international cooperation in tackling the issue. ""Vietnam is committed to implementing its national action plan to address the demand for rhino horn. This MOU will provide a platform for us to work closely with South Africa and other countries to address the supply side of this problem,"" he said. Under the terms of the MOU, the two countries will share information on poaching incidents, intelligence on trafficking networks, and research findings related to rhino conservation. They will also collaborate on public awareness campaigns, capacity building, and law enforcement training. Rhino poaching is not a new phenomenon, but the scale of the problem has reached crisis levels in recent years. Rhino populations in South Africa, home to around 80% of the world's rhino population, have been decimated by poachers. The demand for rhino horn, particularly in Vietnam and other Asian countries, continues to drive the illegal trade. Despite the challenges, there is reason for optimism. The signing of this MOU represents a significant milestone in the global effort to protect rhinos. It also sends a clear message to poachers and traffickers that the international community is committed to combating this transnational crime. The fight against rhino poaching is a long and complex one, but with the support of countries like Vietnam and the commitment of organisations and individuals around the world, there is hope that we can turn the tide against this devastating crime.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Seren Hughes' parents concerned over epilepsy drugs changes,"Seren Hughes's father, Hefin Hughes, expressed his concern and surprise as he learned that Machynlleth Health Centre would no longer sign the repeat prescriptions for the medication that has been effectively managing his daughter's epilepsy. Hefin, a local farmer from the picturesque Welsh village of Machynlleth, has been relying on the surgery to provide the essential medication for Seren, who has been living with the condition since she was a young girl. Hefin's voice trembled with anxiety as he recounted the news to BBC Wales. ""We've been getting Seren's medication from Machynlleth Health Centre for years. It's been working well for her, reducing the frequency and severity of her seizures. It came as a complete shock when we were told that the doctor wouldn't be renewing the prescriptions,"" he explained. Seren, now 27 years old, has grown up with the challenges of living with epilepsy. The condition has presented numerous hurdles for her, from missed school days due to seizures to the fear and uncertainty that comes with the unpredictability of her seizures. However, with the help of her medication, she has been able to lead a relatively normal life, attending college, and pursuing her passion for painting. The news of the changes in Seren's medication has left her and her family feeling uncertain and anxious about her future. Hefin is now faced with the daunting task of finding a new doctor or clinic to provide the medication for his daughter, a process that could take weeks or even months, with no guarantee of a smooth transition. The Hughes family is not alone in their predicament. Across Wales and the UK, many families are grappling with similar issues as NHS clinics and surgeries change prescription policies, leaving patients with epilepsy and other long-term conditions in a state of uncertainty and fear. The British Epilepsy Association (BEA) has called on the NHS to ensure that patients with epilepsy are not left without the medication they need. The BEA's Medical Director, Dr Elizabeth Donaghey, commented, ""It's essential that patients with epilepsy have a consistent supply of their medication. Any change to their treatment can have serious consequences, including increased seizure frequency and potential harm to their overall health. We urge the NHS to prioritise the needs of patients with epilepsy and ensure that they continue to receive the medication they require."" Hefin Hughes and his family are hopeful that the NHS will find a solution to their predicament, allowing Seren to continue her treatment without any disruptions. ""We just want to make sure that Seren keeps getting the medication she needs. She's worked hard to manage her condition, and we don't want any setbacks.

'Inadequate' toilet provision on new TfW trains,"Railfuture Wales, a transport campaigning organization, expressed concern over the insufficient toilet provision on new Transport for Wales (TfW) trains. According to the group, the current arrangement could discourage individuals with health conditions from utilizing the trains. The organization is advocating for alterations to the design, insisting on one toilet per carriage. The issue came to light following the introduction of the new trains, which have fewer toilets compared to their predecessors. Railfuture Wales argues that the current arrangement is inadequate and may lead to discomfort or inconvenience for passengers, particularly those with mobility issues or medical conditions. Furthermore, the organization contends that having one toilet per carriage is a standard practice in many parts of Europe and should be adopted in Wales. In response to these concerns, TfW maintained that the level of toilet provision on the new trains meets the industry standard. However, the organization acknowledged that passenger feedback is being taken seriously, and discussions are ongoing regarding the potential for design changes. TfW representatives expressed a commitment to finding a solution that accommodates the needs of all passengers while maintaining the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the trains. Railfuture Wales, while acknowledging the financial considerations involved, remains firm in its stance that passenger comfort and accessibility should not be compromised. The organization has urged TfW to prioritize the issue and to explore options for increasing the number of toilets on the trains. One potential solution could be to reduce the size of other facilities, such as food and beverage areas, to accommodate additional toilets. Passengers with disabilities and health conditions have voiced their concerns over the issue, expressing frustration and disappointment at the current arrangement. Some have reported experiencing discomfort and even embarrassment while waiting in long queues for the toilet. These issues not only affect the passengers' travel experience but can also pose potential health risks, particularly for individuals with conditions that require them to use the facilities frequently. As the debate continues, TfW and Railfuture Wales remain in discussions regarding the potential for design changes to address the concerns raised by passengers and the organization. The ultimate goal is to find a solution that balances the needs of all passengers while ensuring the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the trains. In conclusion, the issue of inadequate toilet provision on new Transport for Wales trains has emerged as a significant concern for passengers with health conditions and disabilities. Railfuture Wales is advocating for changes to the design to include one toilet per carriage, while TfW maintains that the current level of provision meets the industry standard. As the debate continues, both parties remain committed to finding a solution that prioritizes passenger comfort and accessibility while maintaining overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Transport for London expects to lose Â£4bn,"Ahead of an emergency finance committee meeting, the organisation that runs London's transport system, Transport for London (TfL), has revealed it expects to lose a staggering Â£4bn due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This comes as TfL announced it needs Â£3.2bn to balance a proposed emergency budget for next year. During the lockdown, TfL saw a significant drop in passenger numbers, with the Underground and bus services seeing the biggest decline. According to the organisation, the number of journeys made on its transport network fell by 85% in April compared to the same month in 2019. With fewer passengers using its services, TfL has seen a sharp decline in revenue. The organisation has already received a Â£1.6bn emergency grant from the government to help it through the crisis, but this is not enough to cover the projected losses. TfL's finance director, Graeme Craig, said in a statement, ""The scale of the financial challenge we are facing is significant, and we are in urgent need of further government support to ensure we can continue to run London's transport network."" The pandemic has hit the transport industry hard around the world, with many cities seeing a similar decline in passenger numbers. In London, the impact has been particularly severe due to the city's reliance on public transport. The Underground, in particular, is a crucial part of London's transport network, with over 270 stations and 270 miles of track. The loss of revenue has forced TfL to make tough decisions, including reducing services on some bus and train lines, and increasing fares from October. The organisation has also had to consider other cost-cutting measures, such as freezing recruitment and reviewing its property portfolio. However, TfL's struggles have raised concerns about the long-term impact on London's transport network. The city's economy relies heavily on its transport system, with many businesses and commuters relying on it to function effectively. A prolonged decline in passenger numbers could have a ripple effect, impacting businesses and the wider economy. London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been a vocal advocate for TfL and has called on the government to provide more support. In a statement, he said, ""The government must act now to prevent Transport for London from going bankrupt, or else we risk not only the collapse of London's transport network but the entire economy."" The government has yet to respond to Khan's call for more support. In the meantime, TfL continues to operate, doing its best to keep London moving amidst the ongoing crisis. But with passenger numbers continuing to be low and the organisation facing a significant financial shortfall, the future of London's transport network remains uncertain.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Anti-Semitic Valentine at Republican student event sparks outrage,"College Republicans at Central Michigan University were distributing gift bags to students on Wednesday, an annual event aimed at spreading cheer and fostering unity on campus. However, this year's event took an unexpected and disturbing turn when one student discovered a highly offensive card hidden within one of the bags. The card, which has since been widely circulated on social media, featured a picture of Adolf Hitler, alongside the message, ""Happy Valentine's Day, here's your Schwarzenegger for President 2024 and a little something extra, to make your heart race!"" The use of Nazi imagery and anti-Semitic rhetoric was not only shocking but deeply hurtful to many students, sparking outrage and condemnation from across the campus community. The Central Michigan University College Republicans, who had organized the event, immediately issued a statement, expressing their ""sincere apologies for the offensive material that was included in our Valentine's Day gift bags."" They went on to claim that the card had been ""accidentally included in error,"" but this explanation did little to assuage the anger and hurt felt by those who had received it. Students and faculty members took to social media to express their disgust and call for action. ""This is not a joke,"" wrote one student on Twitter. ""This is not a prank. This is hate speech and it has no place on our campus."" Another student added, ""I don't even know where to begin with this. This is beyond unacceptable, and it's not just disappointing, it's infuriating."" The university administration also weighed in, condemning the incident and promising a thorough investigation. ""Central Michigan University does not tolerate hate speech or any form of discrimination,"" read a statement from the university. ""We are committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of our campus community, and we will take swift and appropriate action to address any incidents of hate speech or discrimination."" The incident has sparked a larger conversation about the prevalence of hate speech and discrimination on college campuses, and the need for more robust efforts to prevent and address such incidents. Many students are calling for more education and awareness around issues of hate speech and discrimination, as well as increased support for marginalized communities. As the investigation into the origins of the card continues, many students are calling for accountability and a commitment to creating a more inclusive campus community. ""We cannot allow hate speech and discrimination to go unchecked,"" wrote one student on Twitter. ""We must stand up against hate in all its forms, and work together to create a campus community that is truly welcoming and inclusive for all.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

"'Invest Â£1.1bn EU cash before Brexit', says council leader","Andrew Morgan, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council in South Wales, has urged the UK government to accelerate infrastructure projects and invest Â£1.1bn of EU funds before the country leaves the European Union. In an interview with BBC Wales, Morgan expressed his concerns about the potential economic impact of Brexit and the need for immediate action. Morgan highlighted the importance of using EU funds to improve infrastructure in the region, which he believes will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. ""We cannot afford to wait for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations,"" he said. ""The business community in Rhondda Cynon Taf, and indeed across Wales, is anxious for certainty and clarity about the future. We need to act now to safeguard jobs and invest in our infrastructure."" The council leader pointed to the A470 dualing project, which aims to improve the road between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil, as an example of the type of infrastructure investment that could be accelerated with EU funds. The project, which is expected to cost around Â£300m, is currently in the planning stages and is due to be completed by 2026. Morgan also called for greater collaboration between the Welsh and UK governments to ensure that EU funds are used effectively and efficiently. ""We need to work together to ensure that the Â£1.1bn of EU funds earmarked for Wales is used to maximum effect,"" he said. ""The Welsh government has set out a clear and ambitious infrastructure pipeline, and we need the UK government to support us in delivering these projects."" The call for action comes as the UK prepares to leave the EU, with negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal ongoing. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's exit from the EU has led to concerns about the impact on the Welsh economy, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. Morgan is not the only political figure in Wales to call for immediate action on infrastructure projects. Last month, the Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford wrote to the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak urging him to use EU funds to invest in infrastructure projects across Wales. Drakeford highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment in creating jobs and stimulating economic growth, particularly in the context of the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. The UK government has yet to respond to the calls for action from Welsh politicians. However, in a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said that the government was ""working closely"" with local authorities to ensure that EU funds are used effectively.

Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen re-labelled food,"The inspection of the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen uncovered a concerning finding: dozens of containers of food items had been re-labelled to extend their shelf life beyond the expiry dates indicated on the original packaging. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the practice had been ongoing for several months. The Scottish Food Standards Agency (SFSA) was immediately notified of the situation, and a team was dispatched to the hotel to carry out a more comprehensive assessment. The SFSA team found that the re-labelling had taken place in the hotel kitchen, with some food items having their expiry dates altered by as much as six months. The practice appeared to have been carried out in an attempt to reduce food waste and save costs, but the potential risks to public health were significant. The SFSA issued a statement expressing its serious concern over the matter. A spokesperson for the agency said: ""Food safety is of paramount importance, and it is the responsibility of food businesses to ensure that the food they serve is safe for consumption. Re-labelling food to extend its shelf life without proper authorisation is not only misleading to consumers but also potentially dangerous."" The Hilton DoubleTree Hotel issued an apology for the incident, stating that they had taken immediate action to rectify the situation and prevent any further occurrences. The hotel also assured guests that all affected food had been removed from service and that they were working closely with the SFSA to address any concerns. The incident has sparked a wider debate about food waste and the pressures on the hospitality industry to keep costs down. While it is understandable that businesses want to minimise waste and save money, the health and safety of consumers must always be the top priority. The SFSA has reminded all food businesses in Scotland of their obligations to ensure that the food they serve is safe and of good quality. The agency also encourages businesses to explore alternative ways to reduce food waste, such as portion control, menu planning, and donating excess food to local charities. In the aftermath of the incident, the Hilton DoubleTree Hotel in Aberdeen has been working to rebuild trust with its guests. The hotel has implemented new measures to improve food safety and transparency, and has offered compensation to those affected by the re-labelling incident. The incident serves as a reminder that the food industry must prioritise the safety and wellbeing of consumers above all else. Food businesses must be transparent about their practices and ensure that they are in compliance with all relevant regulations. Only then can we ensure that the food we consume is safe, of good quality, and free from deceptive practices.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Snow disruption warning stepped down,"It steps down: Police Scotland advice to stage two after being escalated to stage four ""do not travel"" overnight. A yellow Met Office weather warning for snow is still in place, but the most severe travel restrictions have been lifted. The decision to lower the travel advisory came after the weather conditions improved significantly throughout the day. Roads that were previously impassable have been cleared, and flights that were cancelled due to the snow have resumed. However, commuters are still being advised to exercise caution when travelling, especially in rural areas where some roads may still be treacherous. The Met Office warning remains in place until midnight, and further snowfall is expected in some parts of the country. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable, Mark Williams, said: ""We would like to thank the public for their patience and understanding during this period of disruption. The decision to lift the 'do not travel' advice was made following a careful assessment of the current situation. However, we would continue to urge people to check weather and travel conditions before setting out on any journeys."" Transport Scotland's Operations Manager, Gordon Maclennan, added: ""Our gritting teams have been working around the clock to keep the roads clear, and we would like to thank them for their efforts. We would also like to remind drivers to take care on the roads and allow extra time for their journeys."" The disruption caused by the snow has affected a number of industries, including education and healthcare. Schools that were forced to close due to the weather have reopened, but some have implemented delayed starts to allow staff and pupils extra time to travel safely. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities have also reported some disruptions, including cancelled appointments and delayed operations. Health boards have urged patients to contact their healthcare providers if they have any concerns about their appointments. The Scottish Government's Resilience Room, which was activated during the height of the disruption, has now been stood down. The Resilience Room brings together emergency responders and other key stakeholders to coordinate a response to major incidents. Despite the improvement in conditions, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has issued flood alerts for parts of the country. The melting snow is expected to cause flooding in some areas, particularly in the Central, Tayside and Fife regions.

Russia: Fire kills 14 sailors aboard navy research submersible,"The crew of a Russian navy research submersible was tragically claimed by a fire that broke out while they were taking measurements in Russian territorial waters on Monday. The ministry gave no details about the type or name of the vessel, but confirmed that 14 sailors lost their lives in the incident. According to preliminary information, the fire began in the submersible's living compartment. The crew attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were ultimately unsuccessful due to the toxic fumes that filled the vessel. The sailors were quickly overcome and were unable to escape. The Russian Defense Ministry released a statement expressing their condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased sailors. The ministry also stated that an investigation into the cause of the fire was underway. This tragic incident is a grim reminder of the hazards that come with deep-sea exploration and naval research. Submersibles are complex machines that require a high level of expertise to operate safely. The crew's dedication to their work and their tragic demise serve as a testament to the risks they took to expand human knowledge and understanding of the ocean. The cause of the fire is still unknown, but speculation has arisen regarding possible technical malfunctions or human error. The Russian navy has a history of accidents involving its submarines and submersibles. In 2008, a Russian mini-submarine sank during a military exercise in the Black Sea, killing 18 sailors. In 2001, a Russian submersible, the Kursk, sank during a military exercise in the Barents Sea, resulting in the deaths of all 118 crew members. The Russian navy has faced criticism in the past for its lack of transparency regarding naval accidents and incidents. The ministry's initial reluctance to release details about the submersible and the cause of the fire has only fueled speculation and concern. As the investigation into the cause of the fire continues, the Russian navy and the government will face scrutiny and calls for transparency. The families of the deceased sailors and the international community will be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds and what steps will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The tragic loss of life aboard the Russian navy research submersible serves as a reminder of the importance of safety procedures and transparency in naval operations.

How Meryl became Margaret,"By Tim Masters, Entertainment correspondent, BBC News, in Los Angeles Mark Coulier is one half of the team that transformed one of the world's most recognisable actresses into one of the most famous faces in cinema history. The make-up artist, along with his colleague Alison Sexton, spent hours in the make-up chair with Meryl Streep to create the aged and weathered visage of Margaret Thatcher for the film ""The Iron Lady."" The transformation began with extensive research. Coulier and Sexton studied photographs and footage of Thatcher from various stages of her life, paying close attention to the subtle changes in her facial structure as she aged. They also consulted with experts to gain a better understanding of the aging process. Once they had a solid foundation for their work, they started the lengthy process of applying the make-up. They used a combination of prosthetics and digitally-enhanced effects to create the realistic aging effect. The prosthetics were custom-made for Streep, taking into account the unique contours of her face. The team spent hours fitting and adjusting the pieces to ensure they looked natural and seamless. The process was repeated multiple times over the course of the shoot, with Coulier and Sexton making minute adjustments to perfect the look. But the make-up was only one part of the equation. Streep's performance was just as crucial to bringing Thatcher to life on screen. Coulier and Sexton worked closely with the actress, helping her to get into character and offering advice on how to move and carry herself to accurately portray the former British prime minister. The collaboration between the make-up team and Streep was a fruitful one. Their efforts paid off when ""The Iron Lady"" received critical acclaim and Streep went on to win her third Academy Award for Best Actress. Coulier and Sexton's work on ""The Iron Lady"" was a testament to their skills and expertise. But it was also a reminder of the power of make-up to transform an actor and transport audiences to another world. As Streep stepped onto the red carpet for the film's premiere, the world was stunned by the resemblance between the actress and the iconic political figure she portrayed. It was a moment that showcased the artistry and ingenuity of Coulier and Sexton, and solidified their place as masters of their craft. In the years since ""The Iron Lady,"" Coulier and Sexton have continued to push the boundaries of make-up and special effects in films such as ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" and ""The Shape of Water.""

Myanmar court finds trio guilty of insulting religion,"Philip Blackwood, who managed the VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested in December along with bar owner Tun Thurein and colleague Htut Ko Ko Lwin, following a complaint from a Buddhist monk. The monk, Ashin Wirathu, accused the trio of insulting religion through their social media postsings. The posts, which were allegedly made at the bar, included cartoons and satirical comments about religious figures. The three men were charged under Section 295(a) of Myanmar's Penal Code, which prohibits ""deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs."" If found guilty, they faced up to two years in prison and a fine. The trial, which began in January, was closely watched by human rights groups and the international community, who expressed concerns over the use of the law to silence freedom of expression and restrict religious tolerance. The United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch all called for the charges to be dropped and for the Myanmar authorities to respect the right to freedom of expression. Despite these calls, the trial continued, with the prosecution presenting evidence including the social media posts and witnesses testifying against the defendants. The defence argued that the posts were meant to be satirical and did not intend to insult religion. On February 1, after a week-long trial, the Yangon Southern District Court found the trio guilty of the charges. In delivering the verdict, Judge Myint Naing said that the defendants had ""deliberately and maliciously insulted the religion of Buddhism,"" and sentenced them to one year in prison each and a fine of 10,000 Kyats (around $7). The decision sparked outrage from human rights groups and the international community, who condemned the use of the law to punish peaceful expression. Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, James Gomez, said, ""The conviction and sentencing of Philip Blackwood, Tun Thurein, and Htut Ko Ko Lwin on trumped-up charges is a clear violation of their right to freedom of expression."" The three men were remanded in custody to serve their sentence. Their case has highlighted the need for Myanmar to review its laws on religious defamation and to respect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to satire and caricature. The trial and sentencing have also brought renewed attention to the issue of religious intolerance in Myanmar, where Buddhists make up the majority of the population and Muslims, Christians, and other minority groups have faced discrimination and persecution. The authorities have been urged to take action to address this issue and promote religious tolerance and harmony in the country.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Eurovision Song Contest: Ireland knocked out,"By Neil Smith Entertainment reporter, Kiev Galway-born Brendan Murray, 20, brought a touch of Irish charm and innovation to the Eurovision Song Contest stage in Kiev, but it was not enough to lift him into the all-important top 10. Murray, who represented Ireland with his entry ""Dying to Live,"" delivered a powerful and emotive performance, complete with a hot-air balloon prop on stage. However, the European voting public and the jury panel did not show Ireland the love they had hoped for. Murray's elimination came as a surprise to many, given the strong response his song received during the rehearsals leading up to the live show. In an interview with the BBC prior to the contest, Murray spoke about his confidence in his performance and his belief that the song's message would resonate with audiences across Europe. ""I think it's a powerful message about staying true to yourself and not giving up, even when things get tough,"" he said. ""I really believe that the Eurovision audience will connect with that."" Despite Murray's elimination, the Eurovision Song Contest continued to deliver a night full of surprises and upsets. Bulgaria's Kristian Kostov, a 17-year-old singing sensation, stole the show with his powerful and passionate performance of the song ""Beautiful Mess."" Kostov, who was the bookmakers' favorite to win the contest, delivered a captivating performance that left the audience and the judges in awe. His emotional rendition of the song, which was written by Bulgarian composer Boris Milanov, was a clear crowd-pleaser and earned him a well-deserved second place finish. The top 10 was rounded out by Italy's Ermal Meta and Fabrizio Moro with their entry ""Non ho l'etÃ ,"" which came in third place, followed by Portugal's Salvador Sobral in fourth place with his melancholic ballad ""Amar pelos Dois."" The rest of the top 10 included Belarus, Sweden, Greece, and Moldova. As the contest continued, it became clear that this year's Eurovision Song Contest was shaping up to be one of the most competitive and unpredictable in recent history. With so many strong performances and unexpected results, it was anyone's game. But for Brendan Murray and Ireland, their Eurovision journey had come to an end, leaving them to look forward to the future and the many opportunities that lie ahead. Despite the disappointment of not making it to the top 10, Murray took to social media to express his gratitude for the experience and the opportunity to represent his country on the Eurovision stage. ""It's been an absolute honor to represent Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I've made some lifelong friends and have had some incredible experiences",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Japan protests over China ships near disputed islands,"This is the first such protest under new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was elected last month. It also comes amid reports that he wants to increase defence spending in response to growing tensions with China over disputed territories in the East China Sea. The Japanese Coast Guard intercepted and warned Chinese maritime surveillance vessels on Wednesday, after they entered waters around the Senkaku Islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands in China. The islands are located in the East China Sea and are a source of long-standing territorial disputes between the two countries. The incident took place despite repeated warnings from Japan for Chinese vessels to leave the area. Protests were held outside the Chinese embassy in Tokyo, with demonstrators waving Japanese flags and chanting anti-Chinese slogans. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, responded to the protests by accusing Japan of creating trouble and undermining peace and stability in the region. He also urged Japan to avoid provocative actions and to respect China's territorial sovereignty. The Japanese government has denounced the Chinese vessels' entry into the waters around the Senkaku Islands as a clear violation of Japan's sovereignty. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Japan will take all necessary measures to protect its territorial lands and interests. The incident has heightened tensions between the two countries, which have been at odds over territorial disputes in the East China Sea for decades. The disputes also include the waters around the Scarborough Shoal and the Paracel Islands. The protest comes as Japan and China are trying to improve their relations, with the two sides holding high-level talks in recent weeks. However, the territorial disputes remain a major point of contention between them. Prime Minister Abe has taken a tough stance on China since his election last month. He has pledged to boost defence spending and strengthen Japan's military capabilities, in response to what he sees as growing threats from China and North Korea. The incident has also raised concerns among Japan's allies, including the United States, which has called on both sides to exercise restraint and avoid provocative actions. The United States has traditionally taken a neutral stance on the territorial disputes, but has expressed concern over China's growing military presence in the region. The incident comes at a sensitive time for China, as it prepares to host the G20 summit in September. The summit is expected to be attended by world leaders, including Prime Minister Abe, and is seen as an opportunity for China to showcase its diplomatic skills and economic progress. Despite the protests and tensions, there are signs that both sides are willing to engage in diplomatic efforts to ease tensions. China has invited Japan to send a delegation to the China International Fair for Trade in Services, which will be held in Shanghai in November. Japan",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

"Wales' child safety 'needs more co-ordination ,' says charity","The report, published by the children's charity the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in Wales, highlights the need for more coordinated efforts to prevent child accidents in the country. According to the charity, road and water safety, as well as home safety, are the priority areas that require immediate attention. The NSPCC's report comes in the wake of new data that reveals that over 8,000 children under the age of 15 in Wales were accidentally injured in 2019, leading to hospital admissions. The charity argues that a ""whole-government approach to child accident prevention"" is necessary to address the issue effectively. The report further states that while there have been proven methods of reducing child accidents, their implementation needs to be more coordinated. For instance, the charity highlights the success of the child car seat law, which has seen a significant reduction in child injuries in cars. However, the report calls for a similar approach to be taken to other areas, such as road safety and water safety. Regarding road safety, the report highlights the need for improved infrastructure, such as safer pavements and junctions, as well as education and enforcement initiatives. The charity is also calling for the introduction of a graduated driver licensing system, which would allow new drivers to gain experience gradually under supervision. In the case of water safety, the NSPCC is urging the Welsh Government to increase public awareness of the risks, particularly during the summer months when children are more likely to be near water. The report also calls for better supervision and safety measures at swimming pools, rivers, and beaches. Finally, the report emphasizes the importance of home safety, particularly in light of the increased time spent at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The charity is calling for the provision of free home safety checks and the dissemination of information on how parents and carers can make their homes safer for children. The NSPCC's report also highlights the need for better data collection and analysis to identify trends and inform policy decisions. The charity is calling for the Welsh Government to establish a Child Accident Prevention Taskforce to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations. In conclusion, the NSPCC's report on child safety in Wales underscores the need for more coordinated efforts to prevent child accidents. By prioritizing road and water safety, as well as home safety, and implementing proven methods, the charity believes that significant progress can be made in reducing child accidents in the country. However, the report also highlights the importance of better data collection and analysis to inform policy decisions and ensure that resources are targeted effectively.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Avon and Wiltshire trust 'falsified records', report claims","The independent report, written in 2012, was revealed following a Freedom of Information request made by campaigners who suspected falsification of records at Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust (AWP). The authors of the report, who were brought in to investigate concerns about staff performance targets, said records at the trust were ""undoubtedly"" changed to meet those targets. The revelation has sparked outrage and calls for accountability from mental health advocates, patients, and their families. The report, which was initially kept confidential, detailed how data was altered to manipulate performance indicators, such as waiting times for treatment and bed occupancy rates. The authors of the report noted that the falsification was carried out at multiple sites across the trust and involved ""many hundreds"" of records. They also highlighted the potential harm caused to patients as a result of the manipulated data, including delayed or inappropriate treatment. AWP, which provides mental health services to people in Avon and Wiltshire, has apologized for the incidents and said it has taken steps to prevent such occurrences in the future. A spokesperson for the trust said, ""We deeply regret that in the past, some data was not entered accurately into our systems. This was not deliberate, but rather a result of the complexity of our systems and the pressures on our staff at the time."" The trust has since implemented new measures, including additional training and IT support for staff, to ensure accurate and transparent recording of data. However, campaigners and patient advocacy groups say more needs to be done to hold individuals accountable for the falsification of records and to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The scandal comes at a time when mental health services are under increasing pressure due to funding cuts and rising demand. The revelation has raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of data used to measure the performance of mental health trusts and to inform policy decisions. Mental health charities and patient advocacy groups have called on the government to launch a formal investigation into the scandal and to take action to prevent similar incidents from happening again. They also want to see greater transparency and accountability in the way mental health services are funded and managed. The trust's CEO, Dr. Nicky Morgan, has promised a full review of the incident and has said that the trust will cooperate fully with any investigation. She added, ""We are committed to being open and transparent about our performance and to learning from this experience to improve the quality of care we provide to our patients."" The fallout from the scandal is likely to continue for some time, with implications for both the trust and the wider mental health sector. The incident has highlighted the need for greater scrutiny and accountability in the way mental health services are funded and managed, and the importance of accurate and transparent data in ensuring high-quality care for patients.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Montenegro election: Djukanovic declares ruling party victory,"But his pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) is set to win 41% of the votes in Montenegro's parliamentary elections, falling short of the majority needed to ensure a push towards NATO and EU membership. Mr. Milo Djukanovic, the long-standing leader of Montenegro, had presented this election as a referendum on the country's European future. Despite the setback, Djukanovic declared victory for his party, claiming that they had secured the most seats in the parliament. ""The Democratic Party of Socialists has won the elections, and we will form the next government,"" he stated, adding that they would begin coalition talks with other parties. The opposition, led by the Democratic Front, has yet to concede defeat, with some allegations of electoral irregularities being reported. The European Union and NATO have urged all parties to respect the electoral process and await the official results. ""We call on all Montenegrin political actors to respect the will of the voters and to engage in a constructive dialogue for the benefit of the country and its European path,"" the EU's Enlargement Commissioner, OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi, said in a statement. Montenegro, a small Balkan country with a population of around 620,000, has been on a European integration trajectory since gaining independence from Serbia in 2006. Djukanovic, who has been in power for most of that period, has been a key advocate for NATO and EU membership. However, his pro-European stance has been met with resistance from Russia and Serbia, which have expressed concerns over the potential expansion of Western influence in the region. The election outcome is a blow to Djukanovic's plans to secure a two-thirds majority in the parliament, which would have allowed him to amend the constitution to pursue EU and NATO membership without opposition. With a smaller majority, his party will have to rely on coalition partners to pass legislation, making the process more complicated. The opposition, which has campaigned against what it sees as Djukanovic's authoritarian rule and his close ties to organized crime, is expected to challenge the election results. The controversy surrounding the voting process could prolong political instability in Montenegro and delay its European integration plans. As Montenegro awaits the official results and begins the coalition talks, the future of its European aspirations hangs in the balance. The outcome of these negotiations will determine whether the country can continue on its path towards membership in the EU and NATO, or if it will face further political uncertainty and delays.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mary Lou McDonald rejects Peter Robinson's border poll claims,"The ex-DUP leader, Peter Robinson, stirred the political pot once again with his claims that a border poll resulting in a united Ireland with a simple majority could lead to chaos. However, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald flatly rejected this notion during a recent interview. ""What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,"" Ms. McDonald retorted, referring to Mr. Robinson's earlier assertions that the Good Friday Agreement should not be renegotiated. ""If it was acceptable for the Unionist community to seek a border poll under certain conditions, then it should be acceptable for the Nationalist community to do so as well,"" she continued. Ms. McDonald's stance echoed the position of her party, which has long advocated for a referendum on Irish unity as part of the peace process. However, she acknowledged that a border poll was not currently on the table and that the focus should be on implementing the agreement in full. ""We are committed to working within the structures of the Good Friday Agreement and the institutions of the Northern Ireland Executive,"" she emphasized. ""There is much work to be done to address the challenges facing our society, and we will continue to engage in dialogue with all parties to find common ground and build a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" Mr. Robinson, meanwhile, maintained that a border poll could lead to instability and violence, particularly in border areas. He warned that the outcome could be contested and potentially divisive, leading to unrest and even a return to the troubles. Ms. McDonald dismissed these concerns, arguing that the peace process had shown that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland were committed to living together in peace and prosperity. ""The vast majority of people on this island want to see a united Ireland that is peaceful, prosperous, and respectful of all identities and traditions,"" she stated. However, she acknowledged that the road to a united Ireland would not be an easy one and that there would be challenges along the way. ""But we are confident that, with determination, dialogue, and a commitment to working together, we can overcome any obstacles and build a united Ireland that is worthy of the hopes and dreams of all our people,"" she concluded. Ms. McDonald's comments come at a time when tensions in Northern Ireland have been heightened by Brexit and the ongoing stalemate in the Northern Ireland Executive. The Sinn Fein president's call for a border poll may be seen as an attempt to inject some momentum back into the peace process and keep the dream of a united Ireland alive.

Sydney seaplane crash: Wreckage raised from riverbed,"On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family, and a Canadian pilot lost their lives when the seaplane they were traveling in plunged into the Hawkesbury River near Sydney, Australia. The shocking incident occurred during a sightseeing flight, leaving the world in mourning and authorities scrambling to piece together the events leading up to the tragedy. After days of meticulous planning, police, emergency services, and experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) finally raised the wreckage from the riverbed on Thursday. The painstaking process involved using a crane to carefully lift the aircraft from the murky depths, allowing investigators to begin their work in determining the cause of the crash. The seaplane, a DHC-2 Beaver, had taken off from Sydney's Rose Bay Seaplane Base in the early afternoon. Witnesses reported that the plane appeared to be flying normally before it suddenly plunged into the water just minutes later. The cause of the crash remains unknown, though investigators are exploring several possibilities, including engine failure, pilot error, or environmental factors. The victims of the tragedy were identified as Richard Cousins, the CEO of Compass Group, the world's largest contract foodservice company; his fiancÃ©e, Emma Bowden; their three young children, William, Edward, and Olivia; and the pilot, Gareth Morgan. The news sent shockwaves around the world, with tributes pouring in from politicians, business leaders, and the wider community. Cousins, a respected figure in the business world, was renowned for his leadership and philanthropy. He was set to marry Bowden in a ceremony scheduled for later this year. The loss of their young children, aged 11, 10, and 3, has left their loved ones devastated. Morgan, the pilot, was described as a highly experienced aviator with over 2,000 hours of flight time under his belt. The ATSB is examining his logbooks and other records to determine whether any maintenance issues or other factors may have contributed to the crash. The investigation is expected to take several months to complete, during which time the ATSB will examine the wreckage, interview witnesses, and analyze any available data to determine the cause of the crash. In the meantime, the aviation community and the wider public are left to grapple with the tragic loss of life and the reminder of the uncertainties that come with travel, especially in the skies. The raising of the wreckage marks a significant step forward in the investigation, but the question of what caused the crash remains unanswered. As the world waits for the results of the investigation, the families and friends of the victims are left to grieve and remember the lives that were lost in the Hawkesbury River on that fateful Sunday.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Robin Thicke: Blurred Lines tops all-time download chart,"The song ""Blurred Lines"" by Robin Thicke has continued to make history in the music industry since its release last May. Despite facing criticisms and controversy over its explicit lyrics, the track has sold an impressive 1.54 million copies in the UK alone. These sales figures have placed ""Blurred Lines"" at the top of the Official Charts Company's all-time download chart. About 20 university student unions banned the track from being played at events and functions, stating that it promoted ""date rape culture."" Thicke and his collaborators Pharrell Williams and T.I. consistently denied these accusations, insisting that the song was about the ambiguity of consent in a sexual encounter. Thicke even stated in an interview that the song was about ""the confusion that comes when you're in love with someone,"" and that it was ""not meant to be a rape song in any way."" Despite the controversy, ""Blurred Lines"" continued to dominate the charts, spending 12 weeks at number one in the UK and a total of 13 weeks in the US Billboard Hot 100. The song's success was also reflected globally, with it reaching the top 10 in over 20 countries. The controversy surrounding ""Blurred Lines"" brought important discussions about consent and sexual assault to the forefront. The debate was not just limited to the music industry, but also extended to academia, with scholars analyzing the song's lyrics from various perspectives. Some argued that the song's lyrics did indeed promote a problematic attitude towards consent, while others defended it as a reflection of the complexities of sexual relationships. Thicke and his collaborators were not the only artists to face controversy over their lyrics in recent years. Other artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Miley Cyrus have also faced backlash for their explicit lyrics, highlighting the ongoing debate about the role of art in society and the responsibility of artists to consider the potential impact of their work. Despite the controversy, ""Blurred Lines"" remains a significant cultural touchstone. Its impact on the music industry and the larger societal conversation about consent and sexual assault is a testament to its enduring power and influence. Whether viewers and listeners continue to interpret the song in the same way or reevaluate its meaning as new perspectives emerge, there is no denying that ""Blurred Lines"" has left a lasting impact on popular culture. As Thicke and his collaborators look towards their future projects, it will be interesting to see how they address the controversy surrounding ""Blurred Lines"" and whether they will continue to push boundaries with their art. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that they have left an indelible mark on the music industry and the larger cultural conversation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: North East hospitals warn over 'rapidly rising' admissions,"Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth Hospital has temporarily suspended non-urgent elective surgery to free up staff and resources, as the region's hospitals face a surge in covid-19 admissions. In a joint statement, the bosses of several health trusts in the North East warned of the ""rapidly rising"" numbers of covid-related patients requiring hospitalization. The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the city's Freeman and Royal Victoria Infirmary hospitals, has also announced that it will be postponing some planned surgeries. The trust's chief executive, Dame Jackie Daniel, said that the hospitals were ""under significant pressure"" due to the increasing number of covid-19 patients. Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs hospitals in Northumberland and North Tyneside, has also reported a rise in covid-19 admissions and has implemented measures to increase bed capacity and staffing levels. The trust's chief executive, Dame Jackie Bird, said that the situation was ""challenging"" and urged the public to continue to follow public health guidance to reduce the spread of the virus. The joint statement from the health trusts urged the public to ""avoid putting unnecessary pressure on the NHS"" by only attending emergency departments for genuine emergencies. They also reminded people of the importance of getting vaccinated and following public health guidance, including wearing masks in crowded areas and maintaining social distancing. The situation in the North East is not unique, as hospitals across the country have reported similar pressures due to the rise in covid-19 cases. The UK Health Security Agency reported that there were 47,456 new covid-19 cases in the UK on Tuesday, the highest daily figure since the end of January. The NHS is under immense pressure to cope with the surge in covid-19 patients, as well as those requiring treatment for other conditions. The postponement of non-urgent surgeries and the implementation of other measures to free up staff and resources are necessary steps to ensure that the NHS can continue to provide essential care to those who need it most. The public is being urged to do their part by continuing to follow public health guidance, getting vaccinated, and only attending emergency departments for genuine emergencies. The health trusts have promised to keep the public updated on the situation and to do everything in their power to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. The situation is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by covid-19 and the importance of taking steps to reduce its spread.

Covid: Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health boards offer tests for 'flu symptoms',"People in the Swansea Bay and Hywel Dda health board areas who are experiencing flu symptoms or have fallen ill after coming into contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case can now get tested for both illnesses at dedicated assessment centres. The health boards have announced this new measure in an effort to reduce the pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries, as well as to ensure that those with flu or Covid-19 receive the appropriate care and treatment. The assessment centres, located in Llanelli and Swansea, will be open seven days a week from 9am to 5pm. Those wishing to be tested are asked to call the health board's dedicated coronavirus helpline on 01792 607700 to arrange an appointment. At the assessment centre, individuals will be assessed by a healthcare professional and given a test for both flu and Covid-19. Results for both tests will be provided within 24 hours, with those testing positive for Covid-19 being contacted by a member of the health board's contact tracing team. Dr. Richard Foley, the Incident Director for the Swansea Bay University Health Board, said: ""We want to make it as easy as possible for people to get tested if they have symptoms of flu or Covid-19, or if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. By offering flu and Covid-19 testing at the same assessment centre, we can reduce the need for people to attend multiple appointments and help to prevent the spread of both illnesses."" Dr. Nick Lyons, the Incident Director for Hywel Dda Health Board, added: ""We understand that people may be worried about their health and the health of their loved ones, and we want to reassure them that we are here to help. By offering flu and Covid-19 testing at dedicated assessment centres, we can provide quick and accurate results and ensure that those who need medical attention receive it in a timely and effective manner.""

Canada's 'free the beer' case loses in Supreme Court,"Canada's top court upheld a New Brunswick liquor law limiting the amount of alcohol that can be carried across its provincial border, dealing a blow to those advocating for greater interprovincial trade freedom. In 2012, Gerald Comeau, a resident of New Brunswick, was stopped at the border with Nova Scotia with 140 cases of beer and 12 bottles of wine. The alcohol exceeded the amount permitted under New Brunswick law, which allows residents to bring back a maximum of 12 pints of beer or wine for personal use. Comeau was fined $292.50 for the infraction. Comeau challenged the law in court, arguing that it violated Section 121 of the Canadian Constitution, which guarantees the right to carry on trade and commerce among the provinces. The case, known as ""Free the Beer,"" received widespread attention and support, with many viewing it as a symbol of interprovincial trade restrictions and the need for greater economic integration in Canada. However, on July 12, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in favour of the New Brunswick government, stating that the liquor law was a valid exercise of its constitutional powers to regulate the production and sale of alcohol. ""The regulation of alcohol is an area of significant provincial interest, and the right to regulate alcohol is a fundamental attribute of provincial sovereignty,"" the court ruling read. The decision was a setback for those advocating for a more free market approach to alcohol sales in Canada, where each province has its own liquor control board and sets its own prices and sales rules. Critics argue that these restrictions lead to higher prices and less consumer choice. Comeau's lawyer, Constable Blaine Cahill, expressed disappointment with the ruling and said they would be considering an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. ""We are extremely disappointed with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada today,"" Cahill said in a statement. ""Our client, Gerald Comeau, was seeking to vindicate the constitutional right to the freedom of interprovincial trade and commerce. This right is fundamental to Canadian citizens and is essential to a free and open economy."" The decision also sparked criticism from opposition politicians and industry groups, who called for greater interprovincial trade freedom and a more unified approach to alcohol sales in Canada. Despite the setback, the ""Free the Beer"" case highlighted the need for greater economic integration and a more consistent approach to interprovincial trade in Canada. The issue is likely to continue to be a topic of debate and discussion in the coming months and years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China jails two more Tibetan monks over fire death,"Chinese authorities have announced that two more Tibetan monks, Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum, will be jailed following the self-immolation of their fellow monk, Rigzin Phuntsog, in late March. Rigzin Phuntsog, a monk from the Kirti monastery in Ngaba county, set himself on fire on 16 March, becoming the latest in a series of such incidents in Tibet and neighbouring regions. According to the official Xinhua news agency, Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum have been sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively. The reasons for their imprisonment were not disclosed in the report. It is not uncommon for Chinese authorities to arrest and imprison Tibetans suspected of being involved in or sympathetic to self-immolations, or for expressing dissenting political views. Rigzin Phuntsog's self-immolation took place in the courtyard of the Kirti monastery, which has been a focal point of Tibetan protests and clashes with Chinese security forces since 2008. The monastery is located in Ngaba county, in the restive Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China. The area has seen a wave of self-immolations since 2009, with over 150 Tibetans reportedly setting themselves on fire in protest against Chinese rule. The Chinese government has blamed the self-immolations on the Dalai Lama and his supporters, who are based in India. The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule, has called for peaceful protests to promote Tibetan rights and autonomy. Chinese authorities, however, view him as a separatist and have accused him of encouraging the self-immolations. The self-immolations have added to tensions between the Chinese government and the international community, with human rights groups and Western governments expressing concern over the situation in Tibet. The European Union and the United States, among others, have called for an end to the use of force against peaceful protests and for dialogue between the Chinese government and Tibetan representatives. Chinese authorities have responded by increasing security in Tibetan areas and cracking down on dissent. The TAR and other Tibetan-populated regions in neighbouring provinces have been placed under heavy police presence, with restrictions on travel, communications, and religious freedoms. Tibetans have reported being detained, beaten, and subjected to arbitrary arrests and detentions for expressing their political or religious views. Despite the risks, Tibetans continue to protest against Chinese rule, with some resorting to self-immolation as a desperate act of defiance. The self-immolations have brought renewed attention to the plight of Tibetans and the need for dialogue and respect for their human rights. As",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Jack Phillips: Boy from Godalming became Titanic hero,"By Sally Nancarrow, BBC News, Surrey The son of a draper, Jack Phillips was an unassuming young man from the quiet town of Godalming, nestled in the heart of Surrey. But unbeknownst to his neighbours, Phillips was a wireless operator of exceptional skill and determination. He had honed his craft at the Marconi Wireless Telegraph School in Hackney, London, where he had learned to master the most modern and powerful wireless equipment of any merchant ship of the time. Before the RMS Titanic set sail on its ill-fated maiden voyage on 10 April 1912, Phillips shared a poignant moment with his fiancÃ©e, Elizabeth Shimmon. He told her that he had a feeling this would be a momentous journey, and that he would make sure they were reunited, no matter what. As the Titanic sliced through the Atlantic waters, Phillips worked tirelessly in the cramped, dimly lit Marconi Room. He was responsible for sending and receiving Morse code messages, providing the ship's passengers with the latest news from shore and keeping in touch with other vessels at sea. His wireless equipment was the lifeline to the outside world, a vital connection to the safety and security of the Titanic's passengers. Phillips' expertise was put to the test when the Titanic struck an iceberg in the early hours of 15 April. The ship began to fill with water, and panic set in. Hours passed as Phillips worked feverishly to send distress messages, his hands raw from the relentless Morse code keys. His messages were sent out in all directions, in English, French, and German, reaching other ships in the area. Despite the chaos and confusion, Phillips' messages were clear and precise. SS Californian, which was only a few hours away, received Phillips' messages and changed course towards the Titanic. The Carpathia, which was farther away, also responded and set a course to the Titanic's position. But Phillips' work was far from over. He continued to send messages, providing updates on the number of lifeboats launched, the number of people still on board, and the position of the Titanic as it slowly sank beneath the waves. His messages were a beacon of hope, helping to coordinate the rescue efforts and ultimately saving hundreds of lives. Phillips' heroic actions on that fateful night would go on to be celebrated, but he was mostly consumed by the tragedy. He could not shake the memory of the passengers he could not save, and the guilt of those he could. He later told reporters that he had been haunted by the sound of the Titanic's band playing as the ship went down, a haunting reminder of the lives lost. Despite his bravery and heroism, Phillips was never able to fully",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Church of England schools tackle gay bullying,"The Bible or religious texts should not be used to justify homophobic behaviour, says the advice sent to all Church of England schools. But homosexuality is recognised as a normal and natural part of human identity, the Church of England's education arm, the Church Schools Company Trust, has made clear in new guidance. The guidance, released this week, aims to help schools tackle bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It follows a number of high-profile cases of homophobic bullying in Church of England schools in recent years. The Church Schools Company Trust, which oversees more than 300 Church of England schools, said the guidance was intended to support schools in creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for all pupils, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. ""The Bible and other religious texts are sources of wisdom and guidance for Christian communities,"" the guidance reads. ""They should not be used to justify homophobic bullying or discrimination, or to undermine the dignity and worth of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) pupils or their families."" The guidance goes on to stress that all students have a right to be treated with dignity and respect, and that bullying based on sexual orientation or gender identity is not acceptable. It also encourages schools to challenge any derogatory language or behaviour, and to provide support for students who are subjected to bullying. ""Homosexuality is recognised as a normal and natural part of human identity,"" the guidance states. ""It is important to remember that people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are part of the rich diversity of God's creation."" The guidance also includes advice on how to address difficult questions or comments from pupils, as well as suggestions for ways to promote inclusion and acceptance in schools. It encourages schools to provide opportunities for students to learn about different aspects of human identity and diversity, and to challenge any stereotypes or prejudices. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is the spiritual head of the Church of England, has spoken out in support of the guidance. ""Every child in every school has the right to be treated with respect, dignity and love, and to feel safe and secure in their learning environment,"" he said. ""This guidance will help schools to create a culture of inclusion and acceptance, where all pupils can flourish."" The guidance comes as the Church of England faces increasing pressure to address issues of homophobia and transphobia within its schools and wider community. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of homophobic bullying in Church of England schools, as well as concerns about the church's stance on same-sex marriage and transgender issues. The Church Schools Company Trust said it hoped the guidance would help to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment in Church of England schools, and to challenge any forms of bullying or",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid-19: University of Exeter virtual protests over 'lost' student experience,"By Adam Durbin, BBC News Online University of Exeter student Bella Enoizi's petition, which has now amassed over 20,000 signatures, has highlighted the concerns of many students over the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their university experience. The petition, which was started in October, cited the loss of the ""traditional student experience"" as a result of virtual learning and the cancellation of face-to-face events. Ms Enoizi, a second-year English student, said that while she was grateful for the university's efforts to adapt to the situation, she felt that ""the unique and valuable aspects of university life are being lost"". ""It's not just about the academics,"" she said. ""University is also about meeting new people, being part of a community, and having the opportunity to try new things. Those experiences are so important, and they're being taken away from us."" The petition has received support from students across the country, with many expressing similar concerns in the comments section. ""I'm in the same boat,"" wrote one student. ""I came to university expecting to make new friends, join societies, and have the freedom to explore new interests. But now it feels like I'm just stuck in my room, staring at a computer screen all day."" Another student wrote: ""I understand that the university is doing its best in difficult circumstances, but it's not enough. We need more than just online lectures and Zoom meetings. We need the full university experience."" The University of Exeter has responded to the petition, acknowledging the challenges that students are facing. ""We understand that this is a difficult time for our students, and we are doing everything we can to support them,"" a spokesperson for the university said. ""We have introduced a range of initiatives to help students engage with each other and with the university community, including virtual social events, online societies, and mentoring programmes. We are also working to ensure that our students have access to the resources they need to succeed in their studies."" However, some students have expressed scepticism about the effectiveness of these initiatives. ""Virtual events just aren't the same as in-person ones,"" said Ms Enoizi. ""And while online resources are helpful, they can't replace the one-on-one interaction that you get from speaking with your professors and classmates in person."" The petition comes as universities across the country grapple with the challenges posed by the pandemic. Many have had to shift to online learning and cancel traditional events, such as freshers' week and sports teams. The situation has left many students feeling isolated and disconnected from their university communities, and has raised questions about the value of a university education in the digital age. As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how universities will adapt",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Justin Bieber treated by doctors after O2 Arena concert,"Melissa Victor, a representative for Justin Bieber, confirmed that the Canadian singer took a 20-minute rest before returning to the stage to finish his concert at London's O2 Arena on Tuesday night. This unexpected break came after Bieber displayed signs of exhaustion during the performance. Victor released a statement explaining, ""Justin struggled through the first part of the show due to his ongoing battle with dehydration. He became dehydrated again towards the end of the performance and needed medical attention to help him recover."" Bieber's team acted quickly to ensure the singer's wellbeing, with medical personnel attending to him backstage. Reports suggest that he was given fluids and oxygen to help him recover. The singer's condition improved, allowing him to finish the show, but he appeared visibly shaken as he sang the final songs. Bieber's illness came as a surprise to fans who had traveled from all over the world to attend the concert. Many were disappointed when the singer was forced to take a break, but most were understanding given the circumstances. This is not the first time that Bieber has experienced health issues during a performance. In 2012, he was hospitalized for dehydration after collapsing during a concert in London. In 2017, he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which caused him to lose feeling in half of his face and forced him to postpone several tour dates. Despite these setbacks, Bieber has continued to tour and perform, and his fans remain loyal. Many took to social media to express their concern for the singer's health and to offer their support. Bieber's team has not yet announced any plans to reschedule the cancelled portion of the concert, but it is expected that a statement will be released in the coming days. In the meantime, fans are encouraged to keep an eye on Bieber's social media channels for updates on his condition and any upcoming performances. Despite the unexpected interruption, the concert was still a memorable one for those in attendance. Fans were treated to a setlist that included many of Bieber's biggest hits, as well as some new material from his latest album, ""Justice."" Those who were fortunate enough to attend the show left feeling grateful for the experience, and hoping for a swift recovery for the beloved singer.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Swine flu offers 'extraordinary super immunity',"By Michelle Roberts, Health reporter, BBC News In the fight against the H1N1 swine flu, the human body may be developing an ""extraordinary super immunity"" that could protect against multiple strains of influenza, according to new research. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine reveals that when people recover from H1N1 infection, their bodies produce antibodies that can neutralise not only the swine flu virus but also other influenza strains. This ""cross-reactive"" immunity could be harnessed to create a universal flu vaccine, protecting against multiple strains of the virus, say scientists. Professor John Mascola, from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who led the study, said: ""Our results suggest that a significant proportion of the population may already have pre-existing immunity to some influenza strains, and this could have important implications for the design of universal influenza vaccines."" The study involved analysing the blood of 21 people who had recently recovered from H1N1 infection and comparing it with the blood of people who had never been infected. The researchers found that those who had recovered from H1N1 produced antibodies that could neutralise not only the swine flu virus but also avian flu strains H5N1 and H7N9, as well as seasonal flu strains H3N2 and B/Yamagata. Prof Mascola said: ""These findings are exciting because they suggest that the immune response to one influenza strain can provide protection against several other strains. ""If we can understand how these cross-reactive antibodies are generated, we may be able to design vaccines that elicit a broader immune response, protecting against multiple strains of influenza."" The research could also have implications for the development of antiviral drugs. Professor Mascola and his team found that the cross-reactive antibodies could neutralise the virus in the laboratory, even when the virus had mutated. ""These results are important because they suggest that cross-reactive antibodies may be able to protect against not only natural infection but also against antigenically-drifted viruses that may emerge in the future,"" he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the findings, which it said could pave the way for the development of a universal flu vaccine. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for influenza, said: ""This study highlights the importance of continuing to research and understand the immune response to influenza infection. ""By harnessing the power of the immune system, we may be able to develop a vaccine that provides long-lasting protection against multiple strains of influenza.""

Saudi Arabia's women vote in election for first time,"In a historic first for the conservative kingdom, Saudi Arabian women cast their votes in local elections on Saturday, marking a significant milestone in the country's social and political landscape. The participation of women in the elections, which saw over 13 million eligible voters, was hailed as a long-awaited step towards gender equality in the kingdom. Women were also standing as candidates, another first, in the three-tier municipal elections. A total of 978 women have registered as candidates, alongside 5,938 men. The election commission reported a high turnout of women at polling stations, with many donning traditional abayas and headscarves while carrying their identification documents. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been pushing for social reforms, hailed the women's participation as a ""great day for Saudi women."" The prince has been promoting a modernizing agenda that includes lifting the ban on women driving and allowing them to attend sports events. However, critics argue that these reforms are aimed at improving the country's international image and distracting from other human rights issues. The elections come amid heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, following a series of attacks on Saudi oil facilities in September. The kingdom has accused Iran of being behind the attacks, a charge Tehran denies. The political climate in the region has made the election an important test of the Saudi government's ability to maintain stability and address the demands of its population for greater political representation. The participation of women in the elections is seen as a crucial step towards increasing their political power and influence in the kingdom. Women's rights activists have been calling for greater political representation and an end to gender discrimination in the country. Saudi Arabia is the only nation in the world where women are not allowed to drive, and they face numerous restrictions in areas such as education, employment, and travel. The elections also come at a time when the Saudi economy is facing challenges, with low oil prices and high unemployment rates. The participation of women in the workforce is seen as a potential solution to these problems, as well as a way to promote greater gender equality and social cohesion. The historic elections were held under tight security, with the Saudi authorities deploying thousands of security personnel to ensure the safety of voters and candidates. The results of the elections are expected to be announced in the coming days, with the successful candidates taking up their positions in the municipal councils. The participation of women in the elections is a significant step towards greater gender equality and political representation in Saudi Arabia. It is a testament to the determination of Saudi women to assert their rights and demand a greater role in the political and social life of their country. The elections are also a reflection of the ongoing efforts of the Saudi government to modernize the country and address the demands of its population for greater political participation and representation.

Life-extending lung cancer nivolumab drug approved,"Campaigners, including the late Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill, have repeatedly called for widespread access to the life-extending lung cancer treatment, nivolumab. Their pleas gained momentum as Scotland became the first part of the UK to approve the use of this immunotherapy for individuals with advanced-stage disease. This decision is a significant shift from the current National Health Service (NHS) England policy, which restricts access to this potentially life-saving drug to those participating in clinical trials. Nivolumab, marketed under the brand name Opdivo, is an immunotherapy drug that targets and blocks the proteins that help some types of cancer cells to hide from the immune system. By doing so, the drug enables the body's natural defenses to attack and destroy cancer cells. In clinical trials, nivolumab has shown remarkable success in extending the lives of some people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, data suggests that patients who receive the drug experience an average improvement in survival of around four months. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), an independent body responsible for providing advice on the use of new medicines, approved nivolumab in December 2018 for use in Scotland. This decision was based on data showing that the treatment significantly improves survival and quality of life for patients with advanced NSCLC whose disease has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy. News of Scotland's decision sparked renewed hope for lung cancer patients and their families across the UK. The approval of nivolumab marks a turning point in the fight against this disease and is likely to put pressure on NHS England to review its current policy. Since Scotland's decision, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body responsible for NHS England's technology appraisal guidelines, has begun a review of the evidence for nivolumab to determine whether it should be made available to patients in England. The announcement of Scotland's approval came just weeks after the passing of well-known food critic AA Gill, who publicly shared his lung cancer diagnosis and his frustrated pleas for access to nivolumab. His campaign for access to the drug garnered widespread support from the public and media, highlighting the urgent need for change. Gill's untimely death serves as a reminder of the importance of making life-extending treatments, like nivolumab, accessible to all who could benefit from them. As the UK waits for a decision from NICE on nivolumab's availability in England, campaigners continue to advocate for change. They stress the importance of providing patients with the best possible treatment options and the potential impact that wider access to nivolumab could have on increasing survival rates for advanced lung cancer patients.

UK to probe Huawei staff's role at cybersecurity centre,"The news follows a report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee which raised concerns that staff working at the Huawei cybersecurity centre in Oxfordshire were employed by the Chinese telecoms firm. Part of their job is to test and ensure the security of the telecommunications networks that are critical to the UK's infrastructure. The committee's report, published on Tuesday, stated that the presence of Huawei staff at the centre posed a ""risk of Chinese state interference."" This comes at a time when the UK government is currently deciding on the extent to which it will allow Huawei to continue supplying equipment for the country's 5G network. The intelligence committee's findings have prompted the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of GCHQ, to launch an investigation into the roles and responsibilities of the Huawei staff at the centre. A spokesperson for the NCSC said that the organisation takes the issue seriously and that it would be ""working closely with Huawei and others to understand the full facts."" The concerns raised by the intelligence committee are not new. The US government has long warned its allies against using Huawei equipment in their networks, citing concerns about Chinese state interference and espionage. Huawei has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has said that it is a private company that operates independently of the Chinese government. The UK government has been in a difficult position over Huawei. On the one hand, the company has provided crucial infrastructure for the UK's telecommunications networks for many years. On the other hand, there are concerns about the security risks posed by the company's links to China and the Chinese government. In January, the UK government announced that it would allow Huawei to continue providing non-core equipment for the UK's 5G network, but banned it from supplying core equipment. This decision was criticised by some who felt that it did not go far enough to address the security risks posed by Huawei. The investigation by the NCSC is likely to add to the debate about Huawei's role in the UK's telecommunications infrastructure. The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for Huawei's business in the UK and for the UK's relationship with China. The intelligence committee's report also raised concerns about the UK's broader approach to cybersecurity. The committee said that there was a need for greater transparency and accountability in the way that risks to the UK's cybersecurity are identified and managed. The government has said that it will take the committee's recommendations seriously and will take steps to address the issues raised in the report. The investigation into the roles and responsibilities of Huawei staff at the cybersecurity centre in Oxfordshire is a complex issue that goes to the heart of the UK's cybersecurity strategy.

UK government to press for European Court reform,"Ken Clarke, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer and current Secretary of State for Justice, revealed on the Andrew Marr Show this morning that the UK government intends to propose changes to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when the UK assumes the chairmanship of the Council of Europe later this year. Clarke, who served as Chancellor under John Major from 1993 to 1997, emphasised that the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) remains unwavering but called for reforms to address some of the court's operational challenges. Clarke acknowledged that the ECHR has been instrumental in safeguarding human rights across Europe since its inception in 1953. However, he expressed concern over the increasing caseload and the lengthy delays in the resolution of cases, which can take years to be decided. These issues, he argued, hinder the court's ability to provide timely and effective justice, particularly in cases that require urgent attention. The UK government's push for reform comes as the ECHR grapples with the growing demand for its services, which has led to a backlog of over 180,000 cases. This number is expected to continue rising, placing a significant burden on the court's resources and efficiency. Clarke emphasised that the UK's proposals would aim to streamline the court's procedures and improve its efficiency without compromising the fundamental principles of the ECHR. Possible reforms include increasing the use of friendly settlements between parties, expanding the role of committees of experts to deal with less complex cases, and encouraging more dialogue between the court and national governments on the implementation of judgments. However, Clarke acknowledged that the UK's proposals would need to be carefully crafted and negotiated to ensure they gain broad support from the Council of Europe's other 46 member states. He emphasised that the UK's approach would be collaborative and consultative, aiming to foster a constructive dialogue on how to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the ECHR while preserving its core values. When asked about the potential opposition to reforms from some European countries, Clarke admitted that there might be resistance, but he remained optimistic that the UK's proposals would ultimately be seen as a positive step towards ensuring that the ECHR can continue to serve its essential role in upholding human rights across Europe. The UK government's push for reforms to the European Court of Human Rights comes at an opportune moment, as the Council of Europe prepares to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights next year. It is hoped that this milestone anniversary will provide a catalyst for renewed dialogue and action on how best to strengthen the ECHR's ability to serve as a beacon of human rights",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Irish boy struck dumb by First Lady Michelle Obama,"The boy, named only as Billy, was dumbstruck with shyness when he met her backstage at the Gaiety Theatre. He was among scores of youngsters invited to the theatre for a special performance of Riverdance. Earlier, Mrs. Obama had delighted the children with her warm and engaging speech, encouraging them to dream big and work hard. Yet, when the opportunity came for him to meet the First Lady in person, Billy found himself unable to utter a word. Mrs. Obama, sensing the boy's apprehension, approached him with a gentle smile and a reassuring tone. ""Hi there, young man,"" she said, extending a hand towards Billy. ""It's nice to meet you. I've heard great things about you and your dance skills."" Billy's heart raced as he looked into her eyes, a mixture of admiration and fear. He could only manage a nod in response, his voice still trapped within him. Mrs. Obama, undeterred, took the boy's hand in hers and guided him towards a seat. ""Have a seat, Billy,"" she said, patting the chair next to her. ""Tell me, how long have you been dancing?"" Billy's eyes lit up as he finally found the courage to speak. ""I've been dancing for six years, Ma'am,"" he stuttered, his voice still hesitant. ""I love it. It makes me feel alive."" Mrs. Obama beamed with pride. ""That's wonderful, Billy. Keep at it. You have a natural talent for it."" Billy's shyness began to fade as he spoke about his passion for dance. Mrs. Obama listened intently, asking questions and encouraging him to share more about himself. For the first time that day, Billy felt seen and heard. As the conversation continued, Billy found himself growing more confident, his voice becoming stronger and clearer. He felt a sense of connection with the First Lady, who seemed genuinely interested in him and his story. The meeting with Mrs. Obama was a turning point for Billy. He left the Gaiety Theatre that day with a renewed sense of purpose and a belief in himself. He knew that he had the support of the First Lady and the entire audience, who had cheered him on as he shared his story. Billy's encounter with Mrs. Obama was a reminder that even the most introverted and shy among us have the ability to find our voice and make a difference.

Pensioner liable for Donald Trump golf court expenses,"US tycoon Mr. Trump's ambitious plan to build the ""world's greatest golf resort"" at Menie, north of Aberdeen, Scotland, has been a contentious issue for many local residents. Among them is Molly Forbes, an 86-year-old pensioner who has found herself in the midst of a legal dispute with the Trump Organization. Ms. Forbes, a long-time resident of the area, lived in a stone cottage on the Menie estate for more than 50 years. Her property, located near the proposed site of the golf course, was valued at around Â£250,000 before the project was announced. However, the Trump Organization's plans to expand the resort, including the construction of a road and a sea wall, meant that the value of her property was set to increase significantly. Despite this, Ms. Forbes was shocked to receive a letter from the Trump Organization in 2010, demanding that she pay Â£30,000 towards the costs of the road and sea wall that would benefit her property. The letter stated that the expenses were necessary for the development of the golf resort and that failure to pay would result in legal action. Ms. Forbes, who relies on her pension and a small income from her farm to live, was unable to pay the sum demanded. She believed that she should not be expected to bear the cost of the development, which she argued would ultimately benefit her and other local residents. The dispute between Ms. Forbes and the Trump Organization continued for several years, with the pensioner taking her case to the Scottish Land Court. In 2016, the court ruled in her favor, stating that the Trump Organization had not followed the correct procedures in demanding payment from Ms. Forbes. However, the Trump Organization was not deterred and continued to pursue legal action against Ms. Forbes. In 2018, they took the case to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's highest civil court. The court dismissed the case, ruling that the Trump Organization had not provided sufficient evidence to back up their claim for payment. Despite the legal victories, Ms. Forbes' ordeal was far from over. In 2019, the Trump Organization announced that they were taking the case to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Ms. Forbes, who has been battling the Trump Organization for nearly a decade, remains defiant. She believes that she has been treated unfairly and will continue to fight the case, no matter the cost. The saga of Molly Forbes and the Trump Organization's attempt to make her pay for the golf course development highlights the controversial nature of Mr. Trump's plans for the Menie estate. While some see it as a major investment in Scotland's tourism industry, others view it as an unwelcome intrusion that threatens the livelihoods and properties of local residents.

City of Culture: Leicester 'disappointed but defiant',"A ""desperately disappointed"" Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, extended his warm congratulations to Hull as it was announced as the next UK City of Culture. At a press conference held in the city's Town Hall, Soulsby acknowledged the success of Hull's bid, stating that it had demonstrated a clear vision and compelling narrative for cultural regeneration. Despite the disappointment, Soulsby emphasized that Leicester was not disheartened. ""We are definitely not feeling downhearted,"" he said, his voice filled with determination. ""We have been through a rollercoaster of emotions during this bidding process, but we remain confident in our city's cultural offerings and its potential for growth."" Soulsby went on to express his belief that Leicester had previously been underestimated in the competition. ""I had initially believed that Leicester was not up for the bid,"" he admitted. ""But in recent months, I have seen the incredible energy and creativity that resides within our city. We have been proved wrong, and I am proud of what we have achieved."" Leicester's bid focused on the city's rich cultural heritage, from its Roman and medieval past to its contemporary arts scene. The city was also home to the National Space Centre, the UK's largest planetarium and a popular tourist attraction. However, despite these strengths, Leicester faced stiff competition from Hull and other cities, such as Coventry and Sunderland. Soulsby acknowledged that Hull's regeneration efforts had been more apparent in recent years, and that the city had made significant strides in its cultural offerings. ""I cannot deny that Hull has demonstrated an impressive turnaround,"" he said. ""We congratulate them on their success and look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on their city."" Despite the setback, Leicester's cultural community vowed to continue its efforts to showcase the city's unique offerings.

Constable B, a retired officer with over two decades of service under his belt, was rehired by the PSNI in 2016 following his retirement. The report revealed that during his employment, Constable B had been subject to several disciplinary proceedings, but he was not dismissed due to the leniency of the sanctions imposed. Once retired, he was reinstated into the force in a civilian role, which raised concerns regarding the procedures for employing former officers with disciplinary records. Case Two involved a former sergeant, who had been dismissed from the PSNI in 2015 for gross misconduct. Despite the severity of the offense, the report noted that the individual was re-employed by the force in 2017, this time as a constable. The implications of this decision were significant, not only in questionable judgment regarding disciplinary matters but also in terms of the potential impact on public trust and confidence in the police force. In Case Three, the report highlighted the rehiring of a former officer who had been dismissed for dishonesty in 2014. This individual was reinstated back into the PSNI in 2016, but the report indicated that there had been a lack of communication between the various departments involved in the decision-making process. The case underscored the importance of effective communication and information-sharing within the organization to prevent such situations from arising. As we move forward in examining the case studies presented in the report, it becomes increasingly apparent that there are serious questions to be asked about the PSNI's policies and procedures regarding the rehiring of ex-officers. These instances not only raise concerns about the fairness and transparency of the decision-making process but also the potential impact on public trust and confidence in the police force. It is essential that the Policing Board and the Public Accounts Committee thoroughly examine the findings of the report to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to maintain the integrity and reputation of the PSNI. Ultimately, the public deserves a police force that holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct and accountability, and any perceived leniency in dealing with disciplinary matters could undermine that trust.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Jersey States discussing local fish quotas,"Jersey currently works to the EU quota system, which restricts what can be caught in island waters. Deputy Carolyn Labey, the Minister for External Affairs and International Trade, has been leading discussions among Jersey States regarding local fish quotas. The aim is to ensure a sustainable and profitable fishery industry, while also taking into account the needs and concerns of local fishermen. The EU quota system, while necessary to maintain European fish stocks, has been a source of frustration for Jersey fishermen. The quotas often do not reflect the unique characteristics of Jersey's waters, resulting in unused quotas and lost opportunities for local fishing businesses. Moreover, Brexit has added an extra layer of complexity, as Jersey now has to negotiate its own fishing arrangements outside of the EU. Deputy Labey has been working closely with the Fisheries Committee of the States of Jersey to find a solution. The committee has proposed a local quota system, which would allow Jersey to manage its own fish stocks and allocate quotas based on the specific needs of Jersey's fisheries. This would give local fishermen more flexibility and control over their catches, allowing them to adapt to market conditions and focus on sustainable fishing practices. However, the proposed local quota system has faced opposition from some EU countries, who argue that it could lead to overfishing and harm European fish stocks. Deputy Labey has acknowledged these concerns and has emphasized the importance of working collaboratively with the EU and other fishing nations to ensure a fair and sustainable fishing industry for all. The States of Jersey have also been exploring other initiatives to support the fisheries sector. For example, they have launched a new fisheries marketing strategy to help local fishermen sell their catch more effectively. The strategy includes the creation of a new brand for Jersey seafood, as well as marketing and promotional activities to raise awareness of Jersey's sustainable and high-quality seafood. Deputy Labey has also been engaging with the European Commission to discuss the potential for a new fisheries partnership agreement between Jersey and the EU. Such an agreement could provide a framework for cooperation on fisheries management, while also allowing Jersey to maintain control over its own fish stocks. The discussions on local fish quotas are ongoing, and there are still many challenges to overcome. However, Deputy Labey and the States of Jersey are committed to finding a solution that benefits both the local fishing industry and European fish stocks. By working collaboratively and innovatively, they hope to create a sustainable and profitable fishery industry that can thrive in the post-Brexit world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sunday Times Rich List suggests UK's wealthiest defy recession,"The Sunday Times Rich List, an annual compilation of the wealthiest individuals in the United Kingdom, has once again made headlines with its latest findings. The newspaper's research found the combined worth of the country's 1,000 wealthiest people is Â£414bn, up 4.7% from the previous year. This significant increase in collective wealth is a noteworthy development, as it means their joint wealth has passed the level last seen in 2008, before the financial crash, to set a new record. This upward trend in wealth creation comes as a surprise to many, given the economic uncertainty and challenges posed by the ongoing recession. The pandemic-induced crisis has caused widespread job losses, business closures, and financial instability. However, the UK's wealthiest individuals have managed to defy these trends and continue amassing fortunes. The technology sector has been a major contributor to this growth, with tech billionaires seeing their wealth surge due to the pandemic's impact on the digital economy. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google have thrived during the crisis, as people increasingly relied on technology for work, education, and entertainment. As a result, their founders and key executives have seen their fortunes grow. Another sector that has performed well is healthcare. The biotech industry, in particular, has experienced a boom due to the race for a COVID-19 vaccine and treatments. Companies like AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer have all seen their stocks soar, resulting in increased wealth for their top executives and shareholders. Meanwhile, some traditional industries, such as retail and hospitality, have suffered massive losses due to the pandemic. However, even in these sectors, some individuals have managed to weather the storm and even grow their wealth. For instance, the founders of online retail giants like Asos and Boohoo have seen their fortunes rise, as more people shopped online during the crisis. The resilience of the UK's wealthiest individuals is a testament to their business acumen and adaptability. Despite the challenges posed by the recession, they have found ways to create and grow wealth. However, it is important to remember that this wealth is not evenly distributed, and many people continue to struggle financially. The government must ensure that policies are in place to support those who have been most affected by the crisis and create opportunities for wealth creation for all. In conclusion, the latest Sunday Times Rich List highlights an intriguing contradiction. While many are struggling to make ends meet due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the UK's wealthiest individuals are defying the trend and setting new records. The technology and healthcare sectors have been major drivers of this growth. However, the government must ensure that policies are in place to support those most affected by the crisis and create opportunities for wealth creation for all",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'500 killed' due to medicine shortage,"In a letter to the Secretary of Health Ministry, the Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi expressed their deep concern over the ongoing medicine shortage in their regions, which they claimed had resulted in the tragic loss of 500 lives. The letter, obtained by the BBC, detailed the dire situation in the northernmost parts of Sri Lanka, where patients were unable to access essential medicines due to a lack of supplies. The directors stated that they had been repeatedly requesting for the provision of medicines to address the acute shortage, but their pleas had fallen on deaf ears. The situation had become so dire that patients were being turned away from hospitals due to the lack of medicine, the directors wrote. Those who were unable to afford private healthcare were left with no option but to suffer in silence, or seek out traditional remedies that often provided only temporary relief. The directors noted that the shortage affected not just chronic patients, but also those suffering from acute illnesses. In some cases, patients had been forced to resort to buying medicines on the black market, which not only inflated the cost but also put their health at risk due to the uncertainty of the quality of the medicines. The directors attributed the shortage to a combination of factors, including logistical challenges, supply chain disruptions, and funding constraints. They called on the government to take immediate action to address the issue, and urged for increased transparency and communication regarding medicine supplies. The letter came as concerns over the healthcare system in Sri Lanka continued to grow. The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier this year issued a statement expressing its concern over the ""deteriorating"" healthcare situation in the country, citing inadequate funding, a shortage of health workers, and a lack of essential medicines as major challenges. The WHO had also urged the government to prioritize healthcare funding and take steps to improve the supply chain management system to ensure the timely availability of essential medicines. The situation in Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi was just the tip of the iceberg, and the directors' letter served as a stark reminder of the urgent need for action to address the healthcare crisis in Sri Lanka. The lives of countless individuals were at stake, and it was incumbent upon the government and all stakeholders to work together to find a solution. The directors concluded their letter by expressing their hope that the Secretary of Health Ministry would take urgent action to address the medicine shortage and prevent further loss of life. They urged for a collaborative effort to ensure that all patients, regardless of their socio-economic status, had access to essential medicines and quality healthcare services. The letter was a call to action, a plea for urgency and compassion, and a reminder that every life mattered. It was a clarion call for change, and a testament to the resilience and determination of the healthcare",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
University of Nottingham rent protesters offered 'support package',"Hundreds of University of Nottingham students voiced their concerns when they were unable to return to campus due to national restrictions, calling for rents to be suspended. Many were facing financial hardships, with some unable to pay their rent as they were unable to work or access their part-time jobs due to the pandemic. In response to these concerns, the University of Nottingham has announced a 'support package' for students who are unable to pay their rent due to financial difficulties caused by the pandemic. The university has stated that they understand the challenges that students are facing and are committed to helping them through these uncertain times. The package includes a range of measures designed to support students who are struggling to pay their rent. These measures include a rent freeze for students in university-owned accommodation, as well as a rent reduction for those in private accommodation. The university has also announced that it will be providing hardship grants to students who are experiencing financial difficulties. The university has encouraged students who are struggling to pay their rent to get in touch with the Student Services team as soon as possible. The team will be able to offer advice and support, and can help students to access the funds available through the support package. The announcement of the support package has been welcomed by students, who have expressed their relief and gratitude at the university's response to their concerns. Many have taken to social media to express their appreciation, with some calling the university's actions 'commendable' and 'essential'. However, some students have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the support package, and have called on the university to consider more radical solutions to the issue of student rent. Some have suggested that the university could suspend rents entirely, or offer rent-free accommodation to students who are unable to return to campus due to the pandemic. The University of Nottingham has not yet responded to these calls, but has reiterated its commitment to supporting its students during these challenging times. In a statement, a university spokesperson said: ""We understand that this is a difficult time for many of our students, and we are committed to providing the support they need. Our support package is just one part of our wider response to the pandemic, and we will continue to work with students and other stakeholders to find solutions to the challenges they are facing."" The university has also encouraged students to continue following government guidelines, and to get in touch with their academic departments if they are struggling to keep up with their studies. The university has offered a range of online resources and support services to help students stay on track with their learning, and has encouraged them to reach out for help if they need it. As the pandemic continues to impact students' lives, the University of Nottingham's support package is a welcome relief for many. However, the long-term sustainability of the package, and the wider issue of student rent, remains a concern for many students and advocacy groups.

Covid anxiety: Child 'asking if he's going to die',"By Sarah Easedale, BBC Wales news Jane Griffiths, 47, from Cardiff, described how her four children have all been affected by the stress and uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Her eldest child, a 12-year-old boy, had been particularly anxious, regularly asking her if he was going to die. ""He's always been a worrier, but since the pandemic started, his anxiety has increased dramatically,"" Jane said. ""He's constantly asking me if we're all going to be okay, and if we're going to get sick. It's heart-breaking to see him so worried all the time."" Jane's experience is not unusual. According to a recent study by the Children's Commissioner for Wales, one in five children in Wales reported feeling anxious or worried about the pandemic. The study also found that nearly half of all children had experienced a disruption to their education due to school closures and remote learning. For some families, the financial impact of the pandemic has added to their anxiety. Jane's family has been no exception. Her husband, who works in construction, has seen his hours reduced due to project cancellations. ""We've had to cut back on a lot of things, like eating out or going on holidays,"" Jane said. ""But the kids don't really understand why we're not doing the things we used to do. They just know that things feel different, and that's causing them stress."" The pandemic has also disrupted the children's routines and social lives. They've had to adjust to home learning and spending more time at home, which has left them feeling isolated. ""The children really miss seeing their friends and going to school,"" Jane said. ""They're used to having a lot of social interaction, and that's been taken away from them. It's important for us to try and create as much normality as we can, but it's a challenge."" To help her children cope with their anxiety, Jane has been encouraging them to talk openly about their feelings and to engage in activities that bring them joy. She's also been making sure they get enough exercise and sleep. ""We've been doing more family activities together, like cooking and gardening,"" Jane said. ""I've also been encouraging them to do things they enjoy, like drawing and playing outside. It's important for them to have some sense of control over their lives right now."" Jane is not alone in her concerns. Parents and carers across Wales are struggling to support their children during these uncertain times. But by staying informed, staying connected, and staying positive, they can help their children cope with the anxiety and uncertainty caused by the pandemic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Power at Fukushima nuclear fuel ponds restored,"Just after midnight on Tuesday, power was restored to the cooling systems for four spent fuel ponds at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The power cut on Monday evening had raised concerns, as the cooling systems are essential for preventing overheating and maintaining the safety of the fuel. The cause of the power outage was later identified as a tree falling on a power line near the plant during a typhoon. The tree had brought down the power lines, leading to the loss of power to the fuel ponds. Teams of workers from Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator, worked quickly to restore power to the cooling systems. They brought in generators to provide temporary power while repairs were carried out on the damaged power lines. TEPCO had already taken precautions to minimize the risk of any potential issues. Prior to the power cut, they had increased the water level in the fuel ponds to provide an extra safety margin. They had also increased the frequency of inspections and checks on the fuel ponds to ensure their safety. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining power and cooling systems at nuclear power plants. The Fukushima disaster in 2011, in which a massive earthquake and tsunami caused a nuclear meltdown, highlighted the dangers of a loss of cooling and power. TEPCO has been working to decommission the Fukushima power plant since the disaster. The process is expected to take decades and cost billions of dollars. The company has been working to remove the spent fuel from the ponds and store it in safer locations. The restoration of power to the cooling systems was a significant milestone in the decommissioning process. It demonstrated the progress being made in ensuring the safety of the site and reducing the risk of any potential incidents. TEPCO continues to face challenges in the decommissioning process. The complexity of the task, combined with the need to balance safety with cost, means that it will be a long-term effort. However, with the restoration of power to the cooling systems, progress is being made towards a safer and more secure future for the Fukushima power plant. The incident also highlighted the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure and emergency preparedness. Typhoons and other natural disasters are a common occurrence in Japan, and ensuring that power and cooling systems are able to withstand such events is crucial for the safety of the population and the environment. In conclusion, the restoration of power to the cooling systems for the spent fuel ponds at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was a significant milestone in the decommissioning process. It demonstrated the progress being made towards a safer and more secure future for the site, as well as the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure and emergency preparedness.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Demon dog Black Shuck celebrated in graphic novel,"By Nic Rigby, BBC News, East Mark Allard-Will, a renowned graphic novelist, is penning down a captivating new work centered around the legendary figure of Black Shuck. This demon dog, deeply rooted in English folklore, is said to have terrorised various communities throughout history. Black Shuck's chilling tales date back to the Middle Ages, with the first recorded sighting taking place in East Anglia during the 15th century. The beast was described as a gigantic, black hound with piercing red eyes and an uncanny ability to cause destruction and death. Its name originated from the Old English term ""siccan,"" which means ""to shake"" or ""to frighten."" Allard-Will's graphic novel aims to breathe new life into this ancient tale, providing a fresh perspective on the demonic canine for modern audiences. By blending historical facts with fiction, the story will delve into the origins of Black Shuck, exploring its connection to ancient pagan rituals and the early Christian Church. The graphic novel will also examine the various ways in which Black Shuck has been depicted throughout history. From the terrifying creature of legend to the more benign protector of travellers, the demon dog has taken on many forms. Allard-Will plans to weave these different interpretations into his narrative, offering readers a rich and varied portrayal of this intriguing folktale. One of the most fascinating aspects of Black Shuck's legend is the belief that the demon dog could only be seen during thunderstorms. This connection is reflected in Allard-Will's work, which will incorporate vividly depicted storm scenes to heighten the sense of tension and fear. The graphic novel's artwork will be dark and atmospheric, perfectly capturing the eerie and otherworldly nature of Black Shuck. Furthermore, Allard-Will has announced that his graphic novel will feature an original score, composed by renowned musician and folklore enthusiast, Mike Oldfield. This musical accompaniment promises to further immerse readers in the story, evoking the raw emotions and suspense of Black Shuck's terrifying encounters. Despite the demonic nature of the creature, Black Shuck has remained a source of fascination and inspiration for generations. Through Allard-Will's graphic novel, the legend of Black Shuck will continue to captivate and terrify audiences, leaving them pondering the mysterious and the unknown. As the graphic novel progresses, readers will be taken on a thrilling journey through the heart of English folklore, encountering Black Shuck in its many forms. The story will be as much about the people who have believed in the demon dog as it is about the creature itself, shedding light on the enduring power of folktales and their ability to shape our collective imagination.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Macedonia parliament votes to start name change process,"In the hallowed halls of Macedonia's parliament, history was made as two-thirds of the chamber, 80 of 120 deputies, backed the start of the process to change the country's name. The air was electric with anticipation as the representatives, dressed in formal attire, took their seats, each aware that they were on the precipice of a momentous decision. Several more votes will follow before the switch is confirmed, but the significance of this legislative milestone cannot be overstated. In June, the country will begin the formal procedure to rebrand itself, a move that could potentially open the doors to European Union membership and mend longstanding diplomatic disputes. The name change has been a contentious issue for decades, with Greece vehemently opposing the use of the term ""Macedonia"" due to its own northern region bearing the same name. This dispute led to a freeze in diplomatic relations between the two Balkan neighbors, which only thawed in recent years. The decision to pursue a new moniker comes after years of negotiations and international mediations. In a joint agreement signed in June 2018, the two countries pledged to find a mutually acceptable solution to the issue. Under the accord, Macedonia agreed to seek a new name that would not include the term ""Macedonia"" or any other term that Greece considers to be objectionable. The proposed name change has divided public opinion in Macedonia, with some embracing the shift as an opportunity to move forward and others viewing it as an unwelcome concession. Protesters took to the streets of the capital, Skopje, earlier this week, waving Macedonian flags and decrying the impending change. Despite these reservations, the parliamentary majority pressed on, recognizing the importance of the move for the country's future. The name change is expected to be accompanied by a new constitution, which will address the concerns of various ethnic groups within the country and further strengthen the foundations of Macedonia's democratic institutions. As the parliamentarians deliberated, the eyes of the world were on Macedonia. The decision to change the country's name represents a potential turning point in its history, one that could lead to greater regional stability and closer ties with the European Union. Only time will tell if the gamble pays off, but one thing is clear: Macedonia's parliament has taken a bold step towards a new future. In the coming weeks, Macedonia will embark on a complex and uncertain journey. The road ahead is fraught with challenges, but the parliament's decision to seek a new identity is a testament to the country's resilience and determination.

What has the UK accomplished in Afghanistan?,"By Caroline WyattDefence correspondent, BBC News This has been the case since George Bush declared America's mission in Iraq over, under a banner bearing those words, ""Mission Accomplished,"" in May 2003. However, the same cannot be said for the UK's military engagement in Afghanistan. The British mission in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, is far from accomplished. The UK's involvement in Afghanistan started with the US-led invasion to oust the Taliban regime following the 9/11 attacks in the US. Since then, UK forces have been deployed in various capacities, from combat roles to training and advising the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). One significant achievement was the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2002. The ISAF mission was initially led by Germany, with the UK taking the helm in 2013. It was designed to provide security in Kabul and other major cities, allowing the Afghan government to rebuild and establish its authority. Another achievement was the training and development of the ANSF. By 2014, the ANSF had grown to over 350,000 personnel, with the UK playing a critical role in their development. British trainers worked closely with Afghan counterparts, providing instruction in areas such as leadership, military tactics, and logistics. However, progress has been slow, and setbacks have been numerous. The Taliban have continued to launch attacks, and the security situation remains precarious in many parts of the country. The Afghan government has also been marred by corruption and infighting, undermining its legitimacy and ability to govern effectively. Despite these challenges, the UK has continued to support the Afghan government and the ANSF. Britain has pledged to maintain its military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014, with around 1,000 troops expected to remain. This will focus on training and advising the ANSF, as well as providing support in areas such as counter-terrorism and border security. However, the UK's military presence in Afghanistan is not without controversy. Critics argue that the UK's involvement in the war has come at a high cost, both in terms of lives lost and the financial burden of maintaining a military presence. Some also question the long-term viability of the Afghan government and the ANSF, and whether the UK's continued involvement is worth the investment. As the UK marks another year of military engagement in Afghanistan, it is clear that there is still much work to be done. The mission is far from accomplished, and the challenges facing the UK and its allies are significant. However, with a continued commitment to supporting the Afghan government and the ANSF, there is hope that progress can be made, and that a more stable and peaceful future can be achieved for the people of Afghanistan",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New prostate therapy recommended on NHS,"It's called prostate artery embolisation (PAE), and it's a new minimally invasive therapy that's now being recommended on the National Health Service (NHS) for men with an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This condition affects around one in four men over the age of 50, and it can cause a range of bothersome symptoms such as frequent urination, difficulty starting or maintaining a urine stream, and the need to get up frequently during the night to urinate. Officials from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the UK's medical guidelines body, have recently issued new draft guidance which recommends PAE as a treatment option for men with BPH whose symptoms are causing significant problems, but who are not suitable for other treatments such as surgery or medication. The procedure is carried out under local anaesthetic and involves inserting a thin catheter into the groin, which is then threaded up to the blood vessels supplying the prostate. Tiny synthetic beads are then injected into these vessels, blocking the blood supply to the prostate tissue. Over time, the tissue shrinks and dies due to lack of blood flow. PAE is often described as a 'minimally invasive' procedure because it does not involve surgery, and recovery time is typically much quicker than after a prostatectomy. Most men are able to go home the same day as the procedure, and they can usually return to their normal activities within a few days. The benefits of PAE are that it can provide long-term relief from symptoms, and it carries a lower risk of side effects compared to surgery. However, like any medical procedure, there are risks involved, including the possibility of complications such as urinary tract infections, bleeding, and the risk of damage to the nerves that control urination. The NICE guidance also highlights the importance of careful patient selection for PAE, as not all men with BPH will be suitable for the procedure. Factors such as age, the severity of symptoms, and the size of the prostate will all be taken into account when deciding whether or not PAE is the best option. The announcement of NICE's draft guidance has been welcomed by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, which has long advocated for greater availability of PAE on the NHS. The charity's Chief Executive, Angela Culhane, said: ""We're pleased that NICE has recognised the value of PAE as a treatment option for men with an enlarged prostate. For too long, these men have been left with few options beyond surgery or medication, which can have significant side effects. PAE offers a less invasive, more targeted approach that can provide long-term relief from symptoms."" The final NICE guidance is expected to be published later this year, and it is expected that P",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Trump petition: Areas most opposed to US President's visit,"By Daniel Wainwright, BBC News The petition on the Parliament website passed one million signatures earlier this week, and will now be debated by MPs in the House of Commons. It came amid mounting opposition to a potential visit by US President Donald Trump to the UK. The petition, which was started in October 2017, calls on the UK government to ""unequivocally withdraw its offer of a state visit to Donald J. Trump"". It was inspired by the offer of a state visit extended by then-Prime Minister Theresa May in January 2017, just days after Mr Trump's inauguration. The areas most opposed to Mr Trump's visit are not hard to find. London, the capital city, has been the epicentre of protests against the President since his election. During his visit in July 2018 for a meeting with the Queen, thousands took to the streets to voice their disapproval. But opposition to the President extends beyond the capital. In Scotland, where Mr Trump owns two golf courses, there have been numerous protests against his policies and business dealings. In 2016, thousands marched in Edinburgh to protest against his proposed travel ban on people from seven mainly Muslim countries. Wales, too, has seen its fair share of protests against Mr Trump. In Swansea, a city in south Wales, a petition was launched calling on the city council to ban the President from visiting. It received over 8,000 signatures. Northern Ireland has also seen opposition to the President. In January 2017, thousands gathered in Belfast to protest against his travel ban. And in May 2018, the Irish government expressed its regret over Mr Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal. But it's not just cities and towns that are opposed to Mr Trump's visit. Many rural areas have also expressed their disapproval. In the English county of Cornwall, where Mr Trump owns a golf course, a petition was launched calling on the county council to refuse him entry. It received over 10,000 signatures. The reasons for opposition to Mr Trump's visit are varied. Some object to his policies on immigration and refugees, while others take issue with his controversial comments on women, minorities, and the environment. Still others are concerned about the potential cost to British taxpayers of hosting a state visit. As the debate in the House of Commons approaches, it's clear that opposition to Mr Trump's visit remains strong. While some argue that the President should be given the same diplomatic courtesies as any other head of state, others believe that his actions and words are not in line with British values. Regardless of the outcome of the debate, one thing is certain: Mr Trump's visit to the UK will be a contentious issue, dividing opinions and fueling debate",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China and US 'agree North Korea nuclear test measures',"Unnamed diplomats from both China and the United States announced late on Monday that they had reached an agreement on a new set of measures to prevent North Korea from conducting nuclear tests. The diplomats expressed cautious optimism, hoping that a draft resolution outlining the new measures would be put to a vote at the United Nations Security Council as soon as possible. The agreement comes after weeks of tense negotiations between the two global powers, with both sides expressing concern over North Korea's increasingly aggressive nuclear program. The diplomats did not provide details on the exact terms of the agreement, but they did indicate that it included a strengthening of existing sanctions against North Korea as well as new measures aimed at preventing the country from evading those sanctions. Chinese and American officials have been in intense discussions over the past few days, with the two sides reportedly making significant progress towards a deal. The diplomats emphasized that the agreement was not a ""one-size-fits-all"" solution, but rather a first step towards a more comprehensive approach to dealing with North Korea's nuclear program. The Chinese and American diplomats also emphasized the importance of continued dialogue between all parties involved. They expressed hope that the agreement would pave the way for further negotiations between North Korea and the international community. Reactions to the news were mixed. South Korean officials welcomed the news, expressing their hope that the new measures would be effective in halting North Korea's nuclear program. Japanese officials also expressed support for the agreement, but called for even stronger action against North Korea. North Korean officials, meanwhile, were predictably dismissive of the agreement. The country's state-run media reported that the new measures were ""an attempt to intimidate and coerce"" North Korea. North Korea has long insisted that its nuclear program is necessary for its self-defense, and has rejected previous international efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions. Despite the challenges ahead, the Chinese and American diplomats expressed confidence that the agreement represented a significant step forward in efforts to address the North Korean nuclear problem. They emphasized that the international community would continue to work together to find a peaceful solution to the issue. The Security Council is expected to vote on the draft resolution in the coming days. If passed, the new measures would represent a significant escalation in international efforts to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether the agreement will lead to real progress towards a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear crisis.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Removing school bus chaperones in Birmingham 'dangerous',"Some pupils who used the free council bus service with chaperones to the Wilson Stuart School in Birmingham were told unexpectedly that they no longer required this assistance. Heidi Wells, a parent of a 15-year-old disabled son, was among those informed of the change. Her son has a condition that causes him to choke on his saliva uncontrollably, making the absence of the bus chaperones a significant concern. Ms. Wells expressed her frustration and worry, stating, ""I was informed at the last minute that my son would no longer require a bus chaperone. I was shocked and concerned, given the serious nature of my son's condition. The chaperones have been an essential part of ensuring his safety during the journey to and from school."" The council's decision to remove the chaperones has left many parents in a state of uncertainty and anxiety. Some argue that the chaperones play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of their children, particularly those with special educational needs or disabilities. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has voiced its concern over the issue, stating that the removal of the chaperones could put children at risk. Kevin Courtney, the general secretary of the NUT, said, ""We are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of children who rely on these bus services and the absence of chaperones. The council must provide clear and robust assurances that alternative measures are in place to safeguard these children during their journeys to and from school."" The council maintains that the decision to remove the chaperones was made in the interest of cost savings, but parents argue that the safety of their children should be the top priority. The council has stated that it is working with transport providers to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of all children using the bus services. Ms. Wells and other concerned parents are calling for a review of the decision and a transparent dialogue between the council and parents regarding the matter. ""The safety and well-being of our children should not be compromised for the sake of cost savings,"" Ms. Wells said. ""We demand a clear explanation and assurance that appropriate measures are in place to keep our children safe during their journeys to and from school."" The issue has sparked a heated debate in the community, with many expressing their concerns on social media and at local meetings. The council has been urged to reconsider its decision and to prioritize the safety and well-being of all children using the bus services. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what measures the council will take to address the concerns of parents and ensure the safety of all children using the bus services. One thing is certain, however, the issue has highlighted the need for clear communication and transparency in decisions that affect the safety and well-being of our children.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. This meteorological milestone comes as the climate crisis continues to shape weather patterns in the UK and around the world. The sunny May weather was part of an extended period of high pressure over the UK, which brought mostly fine and dry conditions. However, this sunny spell is not a sign that the UK's climate is getting warmer and sunnier overall. In fact, the trend for the UK is towards more frequent and intense rainfall events. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, explains that month-to-month variations in weather are normal and do not necessarily reflect long-term trends. However, the overall temperature trend for the UK is upwards. The last decade was the warmest on record, with the Met Office reporting an average temperature increase of 0.38Â°C per decade since 1884. The UK's warm spell in May was also felt in other parts of Europe. According to the European Climate Agency, May 2022 was the warmest on record for Europe as a whole. The heatwave led to drought conditions in some areas, including France and Spain, where agriculture was hit hard. The heatwave also brought attention to the issue of heatwaves and their impact on public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that heatwaves can cause a range of health problems, including heat stroke, dehydration, and respiratory issues. The elderly and young children are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of extreme heat. The WHO advises that governments and communities need to take steps to prepare for and mitigate the health impacts of heatwaves. Measures include improving public awareness of the risks, increasing access to cooling centres, and ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to air conditioning or fans. The sunny weather in May is just one aspect of the complex and far-reaching impacts of climate change. The UK and other countries need to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. This will help to limit the worst impacts of climate change and ensure a more stable and sustainable future for future generations. In the meantime, we can all take steps to reduce our own carbon footprint and adapt to the changing climate. Simple actions like reducing energy consumption, using public transport, and eating less meat can make a big difference. And staying informed about the latest climate science and policy developments is essential for making informed choices about our future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Child sex abuse live streams loophole to be closed,"It has proposed that live video streams of child sex abuse should be punished in the same way that recorded clips already are, as the government looks to close a loophole in current legislation. Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed plans to amend the Online Safety Bill to include live content in its remit, following growing concerns over the availability of such material on the internet. The proposed measures would mean that social media companies and other online platforms would be held legally responsible for failing to prevent the live streaming of child sexual abuse. This comes after a number of high-profile cases involving live streams of child sex abuse, which have been accessed by thousands of viewers. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has reported a significant increase in the number of live streams being identified and removed, with over 300 incidents recorded in 2020 alone. The NCA has warned that the live streaming of child sexual abuse is becoming more common due to the ease with which it can be accessed and the anonymous nature of the internet. The agency has also raised concerns about the impact on victims, who can be subjected to further trauma as the abuse is streamed in real-time. The government's move to close this loophole has been welcomed by children's charities and campaign groups, who have long called for action to tackle the issue. The NSPCC has hailed the announcement as a ""major step forward"" in protecting children from online abuse. ""It is absolutely vital that the law keeps pace with the ever-evolving nature of online child abuse,"" said Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC. ""We welcome the government's commitment to close this loophole and hold online platforms to account for failing to protect children from live streaming abuse."" The proposed changes to the Online Safety Bill are part of a wider package of measures aimed at tackling online harms, including the introduction of a statutory duty of care for online platforms and the establishment of an independent regulator to oversee their compliance. However, some have expressed concerns that the measures may not go far enough in addressing the root causes of online child sexual abuse. The Labour Party has called for the government to introduce mandatory reporting duties for online platforms, requiring them to report any suspected child sexual abuse to the authorities. ""While it is welcome that the government is finally taking steps to tackle the live streaming of child sexual abuse, we believe that more needs to be done,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's Shadow Minister for Education and Child Welfare. ""Mandatory reporting duties for online platforms would help to ensure that every instance of suspected abuse is reported to the authorities, giving children the best possible chance of protection."" Despite these concerns, the government has expressed its determination to take action on the issue, with Home Secretary Priti Patel stating that ""there can be no place for child sexual abuse, in any form, in our society"".

Trump aide Michael Flynn Jnr out after 'Pizzagate' tweets,"Michael Flynn, 33, the son of President-elect Donald Trump's pick for National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn Sr., left the transition team on Tuesday, after coming under fire for a series of tweets related to the so-called Pizzagate fake news story. The controversy began when Flynn Jr. retweeted and liked several tweets that promoted conspiracy theories linking Hillary Clinton to a nonexistent child sex ring at a pizzeria in Washington D.C. The baseless allegations, which gained traction on social media, resulted in an armed man entering the pizzeria last Saturday and discharging a weapon inside, reportedly in an attempt to uncover evidence of the supposed ring. No such evidence was found, and the man was later arrested. Flynn Jr.'s involvement in the Pizzagate controversy was met with widespread criticism, with many condemning the spread of false information and the potential danger it poses. The incident also brought renewed attention to the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the responsibilities that come with using these platforms. In a statement on Tuesday, Flynn Jr. apologized for his actions, acknowledging that his tweets ""were wrong, and I should not have retweeted them."" He added, ""I deeply apologize for any confusion and concern I may have caused."" Despite the controversy surrounding his son, Michael Flynn Sr. remains a key figure in Trump's transition team and is expected to play a significant role in national security policy once Trump takes office. When asked about the situation during a press conference on Tuesday, Trump expressed his support for Flynn Sr., saying, ""Mike is a man of tremendous talent and tremendous capability. I've known him for a long time."" Despite the controversy surrounding Flynn Jr., it is unclear whether his departure from the transition team is directly related to the Pizzagate incident. Trump's team has not issued a formal statement on the matter, and it is not yet known whether Flynn Jr.'s resignation was voluntary or if he was asked to leave. Regardless, the incident serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of spreading false information on social media, particularly in the context of high-stakes political campaigns and the sensitive nature of national security matters. It also highlights the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking in the digital age, as well as the need for greater transparency and accountability from those in positions of power and influence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

As the credits rolled, the audience erupted into applause. Akeem was moved to tears by the outpouring of support. But then Idris Elba, who plays the older version of Jerry, appeared on the stage. Akeem's emotions reached new heights. ""I had tears in my eyes,"" Akeem told Newsbeat. ""Just seeing Idris Elba in person was a surreal moment. I've looked up to him for a long time."" Idris, who is also a rapper and DJ, grew up in Hackney, East London, not far from where Yardie is set. He has spoken about how the film resonated with him. ""He's a legend,"" Akeem says.

""I'm proud of all of you."" Akeem's journey to the big screen began when he was discovered by a talent scout in his local area. He's now studying acting at the Identity School of Acting in London. ""I just want to keep improving and learning,"" he says. ""I want to be a versatile actor who can play different roles."" Akeem says the experience of working on Yardie has been invaluable. He's learned a lot from the cast and crew, and he's grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an important project. ""I want to thank everyone who's supported me,"" he says. ""I couldn't have done it without them."" As for Idris Elba, Akeem is inspired by his work ethic and dedication to his craft. He hopes to follow in his footsteps and make a lasting impact on the industry. ""I want to leave a legacy,"" he says.

Officials probe Missouri governor for 'blackmail and assault',"In a shocking turn of events, Missouri Governor Eric Greitens found himself at the center of a scandal involving allegations of blackmail and assault. The scandal came to light when the spurned ex-husband of the woman, who has not been named in reports, secretly recorded her describing the otherwise consensual encounter. During the recorded conversation, the woman alleged thatafter a consensual sexual encounter in 2015, the governor took a photo of her partially naked without her consent. She claimed that he then threatened to use the photo as blackmail if she ever spoke about the encounter. The allegations did not end there. On Thursday, the man added that Mr Greitens had ""slapped her hard open-hand"" during the encounter, leaving her with a mark on her face. The woman reportedly sought medical attention for the mark at the time, but no report was filed with the police. The governor's office has denied the allegations, with a spokesperson stating that ""there was no harm or danger to anyone"" during the encounter. However, the woman's account of the incident has been corroborated by a friend who was present during the conversation where she described the alleged assault. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office is now investigating the allegations, with a spokesperson confirming that they have received information regarding the incident and are ""reviewing and assessing the evidence."" The governor, who is currently in Israel on a trade mission, has not yet commented on the allegations directly. However, in a statement released through his spokesperson, he said ""I have faith in the process and I will fully cooperate with the investigation to ensure the truth comes out."" The allegations come at a difficult time for the governor, who is already facing calls for his resignation over unrelated ethical concerns. In February, it was revealed that he had used a charity donor list for political fundraising, which is against state law. Missouri Democrats have called for Greitens to step down, with state House Minority Leader Crystal Quade stating ""If these allegations are true, then the governor has committed a grave violation of trust and should resign immediately."" The governor's Republican allies have rallied around him, with Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz stating ""Governor Greitens continues to have my full support. I trust him to do the right thing for the people of Missouri."" The investigation into the allegations is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what, if any, evidence will be uncovered. In the meantime, the scandal is casting a shadow over Greitens' administration and raising serious questions about his leadership.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Jimmy Carr faces crowd after tax furore,"Jimmy Carr, the well-known British comedian, found himself in the midst of a heated exchange with the audience during a recent stand-up performance in Manchester. The incident came in the wake of the comedian's involvement in a high-profile tax avoidance scheme, which has left him widely condemned in the public eye. As Carr took the stage, he was met with a chorus of boos and jeers from the crowd. Unfazed, he began his act, addressing the elephant in the room head-on. ""I see I've caused a bit of a stir, haven't I?"" he quipped, trying to inject some levity into the situation. But the crowd was not in a forgiving mood. One heckler, in particular, continued to voice his disapproval, shouting out accusations and demands for an apology. Carr, ever the quick-witted performer, tried to defuse the situation with his trademark humor. ""I've made a mistake, and I'll pay the price for it,"" he quipped, drawing on the age-old comedian's mantra of turning lemons into lemonade. But the heckler was not to be swayed. ""You're a millionaire! You don't need to cheat the system!"" he shouted, his voice rising above the din of the crowd. Carr, visibly frustrated, shot back, ""I'm not cheating the system, I'm using it to my advantage, just like everyone else in this room!"" The exchange continued for several minutes, with Carr trying to engage the heckler in a debate about the morality of tax avoidance and the complexities of the tax system. But the crowd, increasingly restless, began to turn against Carr, with some calling for him to be escorted off the stage. In the end, Carr was forced to abandon his act, leaving the stage to a chorus of boos and jeers. The incident served as a stark reminder of the power of public opinion and the potential consequences of tax-related controversies. Carr, for his part, has issued a statement expressing regret for his involvement in the tax scheme and promising to pay any outstanding taxes owed. But the damage has been done, and the comedian's reputation has taken a hit. Only time will tell if he can recover from this PR disaster and reclaim his place in the hearts and minds of his fans. In the meantime, the incident has sparked a wider debate about tax avoidance and the role of celebrities in setting moral examples.

Files released on 1974 'Welsh Roswell',"There was a huge bang and a brilliant light over the Berwyn Mountains in north east Wales on the night of November 7, 1974. The incident, which occurred near the village of Llanfihangel y Pennant, was reported by several locals who claimed to have seen an unusual object falling from the sky. The object, described as a metallic disc with bright lights, crashed into the mountainside, causing a loud explosion that shook the surrounding area. According to some reports, military personnel arrived at the scene shortly after the incident, and the area was cordoned off. Comparisons were quickly drawn with the infamous Roswell, New Mexico, incident of 1947, where reports of a crashed alien spaceship sparked a flurry of UFO speculation and conspiracy theories. In Wales, rumors began to circulate that the military had recovered an alien spacecraft and were concealing the evidence. Local farmer, Ivor Jenkins, claimed that he had seen military personnel carrying strange objects from the crash site. He described the objects as being metallic and roughly human-shaped, with large eyes and long, thin limbs. Jenkins also reported seeing unusual lights in the sky on the night of the incident. The military denied any involvement in the incident, claiming that it was likely a meteorite or a fallen satellite. However, this explanation did little to quell the rumors and speculation that continued to swirl around the Welsh Roswell incident. UFO enthusiasts from around the world began to descend on the area, hoping to uncover the truth. Some claimed to have found strange metallic debris at the crash site, while others reported seeing unusual lights in the sky. Despite numerous investigations and inquiries, no definitive evidence was ever produced to support the claims of a UFO crash or the recovery of extraterrestrial beings. However, the Welsh Roswell incident remains a popular topic of debate and speculation among UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists to this day. Some believe that the incident was covered up by the military, who were attempting to conceal the existence of extraterrestrial life. Others believe that it was a hoax, staged by pranksters or attention-seekers. Regardless of the truth, the Welsh Roswell incident continues to capture the imagination and fascination of people around the world. It serves as a reminder of the enduring human desire to explore the unknown and to search for answers to the mysteries of the universe. In the years since the incident, there have been numerous reports of UFO sightings and alleged encounters with extraterrestrial beings. However, none have been proven to be as controversial or as intriguing as the events that unfolded over the Berwyn Mountains in north east Wales on that fateful night in 1974.

Amnesty calls for GCHQ spying inquiry,"It was with a strong sense of disbelief and indignation that Amnesty International responded to the news that the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had been secretly monitoring the human rights organization. It said it was ""outrageous"" that such an intrusion had taken place, and called for an immediate and independent inquiry into the matter. The revelation came to light following a ruling by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which found that GCHQ had breached rules by keeping data intercepted from Amnesty for longer than permitted. The intercepted data included emails and other communications between Amnesty staff and its partners, some of which contained sensitive information regarding the organization's human rights work in various parts of the world. Amnesty's UK Director Kate Allen described the situation as a ""flagrant violation of our right to privacy and freedom of expression"" and an ""affront to democracy"". She went on to say that the monitoring of human rights organizations by intelligence agencies was a ""troubling trend"" that undermined the very values that these organizations were fighting for. The IPT ruling, which was made in December 2018 but only recently made public, related to interceptions carried out between 2015 and 2016. However, Amnesty expressed concern that this was not an isolated incident, and called on the government to provide assurances that similar breaches were not taking place currently. The organization also raised concerns about the potential implications for its work and the safety of its staff and partners. ""This kind of surveillance can put people's lives at risk,"" Allen said, ""and it is essential that those who work for human rights organizations are able to do so safely and with the confidence that their communications will not be intercepted and shared with others without their consent."" Amnesty's call for an inquiry was backed by other human rights organizations and civil liberties groups, who expressed similar concerns about the potential for widespread surveillance and its impact on their work. The government, for its part, has yet to respond to these calls, and has given no indication as to whether or not an inquiry will be held. The GCHQ monitoring controversy is just the latest in a long line of revelations about the extent of state surveillance and the potential infringement of civil liberties. It comes at a time when concerns about the balance between national security and individual privacy are at the forefront of public discourse, and when the role of intelligence agencies in democratic societies is being increasingly scrutinized. Amnesty's call for an inquiry is a reminder that the right to privacy and freedom of expression are not just abstract concepts, but fundamental human rights that must be protected. It is a call for transparency, accountability, and respect for the rule of law. And it is a call that must be heard and acted upon by those in positions of power and authority.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Oculus anti-piracy update cracked in a day,"The Oculus anti-piracy update, designed to enhance security and protect developers' intellectual property, was met with swift resistance from the gaming community. Released just a day ago, the update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device. Additionally, it breaks an unofficial patch called Revive, which had enabled Oculus-only games to run on rival devices such as the HTC Vive or Valve Index. However, the update's implementation hasn't deterred piracy enthusiasts for long. A vibrant community of modders and hackers has already managed to crack the anti-piracy measures. The news has left some gamers feeling frustrated and disillusioned. ""I don't understand why Oculus can't leave us alone. We just want to play our games,"" said one gamer in a popular VR forum. The crack, which was shared within hours of the update's release, also restores the functionality of Revive. Gamers can now enjoy their Oculus-exclusive titles on non-Oculus devices once again. The piracy community has hailed the crack as a victory, proving that no digital rights management (DRM) system is foolproof. Oculus, owned by Facebook, has responded to the development by stating that they will continue to investigate and address any unauthorized modifications. ""We take piracy seriously and will take action against any unauthorized modifications or circumvention of our security measures,"" an Oculus spokesperson said in a statement. The situation has sparked a larger debate within the VR community regarding the role of DRM and the ethical implications of piracy. Some argue that piracy hurts developers and undermines their financial incentives to create new and innovative content. Others counter that DRM restricts consumer freedom and can lead to frustration and anger. In the meantime, the cat-and-mouse game between developers and pirates continues, with both sides constantly seeking to outmaneuver each other. As technology evolves, so too will the methods used to circumvent DRM and protect intellectual property. Only time will tell who will ultimately come out on top. The cracking of Oculus' anti-piracy update in such a short time raises questions about the effectiveness of such measures. The VR industry is still in its infancy, and developers are grappling with the challenges of creating a secure and profitable ecosystem. As the community grows and matures, it will be interesting to see how both Oculus and the piracy community adapt to each other's moves.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Labour/Tory deal at Stirling Council ousts SNP,"In the hallowed chambers of Stirling Council, the familiar sounds of political jostling and horse-trading echoed through the air as Labour and the Conservatives announced a deal to form a coalition government, ousting the Scottish National Party (SNP) from power. The agreement, which came after weeks of intense negotiation, will see both parties share control of the local authority for the next two years. Both parties said their priority would be balancing the local authority's books over the next two years. The financial pressures facing Stirling Council are no secret, with a projected deficit of Â£12 million looming large over the coming months. The new administration will have to act swiftly to address this issue and prevent further cuts to essential services. Despite the SNP's recent return to power following local elections in May, the Labour and Conservative parties have demonstrated their commitment to working together in the best interests of the community. The SNP, who had governed the council since 2017, had faced criticism over their handling of the financial situation. With the financial challenges mounting, the two opposition parties saw an opportunity to join forces and take control. The deal, which was reached late last week, will see Labour take the majority of the key cabinet positions, including the role of council leader. The Conservatives, who will hold the deputy leadership, have secured important portfolios such as finance and development. Both parties have agreed to a programme of policies that will focus on economic regeneration, improving infrastructure, and addressing the housing crisis. The SNP, who had held a slim majority in the council following the elections, were left reeling from the unexpected turn of events. Party leader, Councillor Christine Simpson, issued a statement expressing disappointment at the outcome but pledged to continue working for the people of Stirling. The new administration, however, remains confident that they can deliver on their promises. Speaking to reporters, Labour's new council leader, Councillor Mike Paterson, said, ""We have a clear mandate from the people of Stirling to get on with the job of running their council. We will work tirelessly to address the financial challenges facing the authority and ensure that essential services are protected."" The Conservatives, too, are eager to get started. Councillor Jim Thompson, the party's spokesperson on finance, emphasised the importance of a stable administration and the need to tackle the financial issues head-on. ""We have a responsibility to the people of Stirling to ensure that their council is financially sustainable. We will work closely with our Labour colleagues to deliver a budget that balances the books and invests in the future of our community,"" he said.

'Minnie Lisa' unveiled at Beano exhibition in Dundee,"The portrait has been made to celebrate Bash Street's return to the McManus Galleries in Dundee, now renamed McMenace, which has become the most popular comic exhibition ever in the UK. The gallery, a tribute to the Beano's 80th anniversary, has drawn in thousands of visitors since its opening, and the newest addition to the display has truly captured the imagination of the public. Minnie the Minx, the mischievous and iconic character from the Beano comic, has been the subject of a stunning new portrait that was unveiled at the exhibition last week. The portrait, which depicts Minnie in her signature red jumper, blue ribbon, and mischievous grin, has been created by renowned Scottish artist, John Byrne, who is best known for his work on the X-Men and Doctor Who comics. Byrne, who grew up reading the Beano and has been a fan of Minnie the Minx since childhood, was thrilled to be given the opportunity to create the piece. Speaking at the unveiling, he said, ""It's an honour to be asked to create a portrait of such an iconic character. Minnie the Minx has been a part of my life since I was a boy, and it's been a pleasure to bring her to life in this new way."" The portrait, which is painted in acrylics, measures an impressive 6ft by 4ft, and has been created in a style that pays homage to the classic comic strip. The background is adorned with images of Bash Street School and its various inhabitants, adding to the nostalgic feel of the piece. Visitors to the exhibition have been wowed by the portrait, with many taking to social media to express their excitement and admiration for the work. One visitor commented, ""I grew up reading the Beano, and Minnie the Minx was always my favourite character. This portrait is absolutely stunning, and it's amazing to see her brought to life in such a beautiful way."" The McMenace exhibition, which runs until the end of the year, also features a range of other Beano-related displays, including original comic strips, props, and memorabilia. It's a must-see for any fan of the comic, and the Minnie the Minx portrait is certainly a highlight of the show. As the exhibition continues to draw in crowds, it's clear that the Beano's enduring appeal is still going strong. With characters like Minnie the Minx at the forefront, it's easy to see why the comic has been a beloved part of British culture for eight decades. The Minnie the Minx portrait is a fitting tribute to the character and the comic as a whole, and it's sure to be a talking point for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Hartson, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2019, arrived at the center with a beaming smile, looking every inch the proud patron. He was greeted with warm applause from the crowd that had gathered to mark the occasion. Hartson, who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy, spoke about his own experiences with cancer and the importance of centers like Maggie's in providing emotional and practical support to those going through similar challenges. ""When I was diagnosed, I was terrified,"" Hartson said, addressing the crowd. ""But the support I received from my family, friends, and the medical professionals was incredible. Maggie's Swansea is going to be that vital resource for so many people in this community."" The new center, which is located in the grounds of Singleton Hospital, has been designed to provide a welcoming and homely environment for cancer patients and their families. It features a number of comfortable and quiet spaces where people can relax, chat, or take part in various activities, as well as a kitchen where they can prepare and share meals. Maggie's Swansea is part of a larger network of cancer support centers that was founded in 1995 by Maggie Keswick Jencks. The organization, which is funded by the National Lottery and various charitable trusts, has helped thousands of people across the UK who are affected by cancer. During the opening ceremony, the guests were given a tour of the new facilities, which also include a garden where people can relax and connect with nature. They were also treated to a demonstration of some of the activities that will be on offer at the center, such as art therapy, yoga, and mindfulness sessions. As the ceremony came to a close, Hartson was presented with a plaque in recognition of his support for Maggie's Swansea. He thanked the organizers and the donors for their generosity and urged everyone to continue supporting the center and the vital work that it does.

Meghan and Harry attend NZ ceremony to mark first votes for women,"Meghan was speaking on day one of her visit to New Zealand with Prince Harry. It is the last stop on their whirlwind tour of the Pacific, a journey that began in Fiji and Tonga. The air was crisp and cool in Auckland as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their way to the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The occasion for their visit was significant. They were there to mark the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand, making it the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote. Meghan, an advocate for women's rights, was particularly moved by the milestone. ""I am deeply grateful to be here today, to stand in solidarity with the trailblazing women of Aotearoa New Zealand,"" Meghan said in her speech. ""Your achievement in becoming the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote is a testament to your resilience and determination."" She went on to highlight the importance of the suffrage movement not just in New Zealand but around the world. ""The story of women's suffrage here is a beacon of hope and a reminder of the progress we have made, but also of the work that still needs to be done,"" she said. Prince Harry also spoke at the ceremony, recognising the importance of the achievement for New Zealand and for the wider world. ""Today we celebrate the courage, determination and resilience of the women who fought for their right to vote, and the men who supported them,"" he said. ""Your actions here in New Zealand paved the way for women around the world to have their voices heard.""

They spent time learning about the country's unique natural wonders, its Maori heritage, and its military history. As they left the museum, Meghan and Harry were greeted by a throng of well-wishers. They spent time chatting and taking photographs, before getting back in their car for the journey to the airport. Their tour of the Pacific may be coming to an end, but Meghan and Harry's commitment to women's rights and gender equality will continue long after they have left the region.

Thai Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn leads bike ride 'for Mom',"Wearing shirts in the queen's colour - sky-blue - and emblazoned with ""Bike for Mom"", the cyclists paraded through the streets of Bangkok on a sunny Sunday morning. An air of excitement and anticipation hung in the air as thousands of Thais, young and old, gathered to take part in the annual bike ride organized by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn in honour of his beloved mother, Her Majesty Queen Sirikit. The queen, who turned 83 on August 12, was known for her love of cycling and had been an advocate for health and fitness for decades. The Crown Prince's initiative not only aimed to promote a healthy lifestyle but also to demonstrate solidarity with his mother and pay tribute to her on her birthday. As the cyclists set off from Sanam Chandra Palace, the residence of the Crown Prince, the streets of Bangkok were closed to traffic, allowing the riders to pedal safely and freely. The sight of the sea of blue shirts and bicycles weaving through the usually congested roads was a spectacular one, drawing cheers and well-wishes from onlookers. The route took the cyclists through some of Bangkok's most iconic landmarks, including the Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, and Wat Arun. The historic temples, bathed in the golden sunlight, provided a picturesque backdrop for the event. Meanwhile, outside the capital, Thais in every corner of the country were encouraged to join the Bike for Mom campaign by organizing their own rides in their communities. Social media was abuzz with photos and videos of Thais across the nation mounting their bicycles, wearing their sky-blue shirts, and riding in solidarity with the Crown Prince and his mother. As the day wore on, the cyclists returned to Sanam Chandra Palace, where they were greeted by the Crown Prince and Queen Sirikit. The queen, who had watched the event from a balcony, waved to her subjects with a warm smile, visibly touched by the display of love and respect from her people. The Bike for Mom campaign was a testament to the deep bond between the Thai people and their royal family. It was a reminder that even in the face of adversity, the Thai people could come together in unity and celebrate the joys of life, health, and family. The annual event would undoubtedly continue to be a cherished tradition for generations to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rajar figures: Radio news listeners fall but boost for music shows,"Today's release of Rajar (Radio Joint Audience Research) figures reveals a year-on-year decline in radio news listeners, with a total drop of 839,000. This marks a concerning trend for broadcasters relying heavily on news programming to attract and retain audiences. However, despite the dip in news listeners, there is a silver lining for music-focused shows. Rajar reports that the number of people tuning into radio for music has increased by 700,000 in the past year. This growth can be attributed to the continued popularity of formats like BBC Radio 1, which has consistently held the top spot in the charts with its diverse music selection and influential presenters. The shift in listening habits is not limited to traditional radio platforms. Digital radio, including DAB and online streams, has experienced a surge in popularity, with a 10.2% increase in reach since the last Rajar report. This growth is particularly noticeable among younger demographics, who are increasingly turning to digital platforms for their radio fix. In the context of these figures, BBC Radio 1's Digital Assistant, Greg James, has become a standout performer. His breakfast show has seen an impressive year-on-year growth of 257,000 listeners. James's ability to engage with audiences through various mediums, including social media and podcasts, has contributed to his show's success. Another notable performer is BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which, despite the overall decline in news listeners, maintains its position as the most popular news and current affairs show. However, it has experienced a year-on-year drop of 337,000 listeners. The decline can be attributed to increased competition from digital news sources and podcasts, which offer audiences more flexibility and convenience. In response to these trends, broadcasters are adapting their strategies to cater to changing listener preferences. BBC Radio 4, for instance, has announced plans to launch a new digital-only station focused on arts and culture. Similarly, commercial broadcasters are investing in podcasting to tap into the growing demand for on-demand audio content. In conclusion, the latest Rajar figures present a mixed picture for the UK radio industry. While there is a concerning decline in news listeners, the growth in music-focused shows and the surge in digital radio usage offer reasons for optimism. Broadcasters will need to continue adapting to these trends to stay competitive and engage with increasingly diverse and tech-savvy audiences.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Culture secretary questions Edinburgh tourist tax plans,"The council says adding a Â£1 charge to hotel guests' bills could raise Â£11m to fund local services in Edinburgh. Leader Adam McVey of the City of Edinburgh Council presented this proposal, known as the Tourist Tax or Bed Tax, during a meeting with Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop. Hyslop, however, raised concerns over the potential impact on the tourism industry and the legalities of implementing such a tax without the Scottish Government's approval. ""While I recognise the need for Edinburgh to invest in local services, I am concerned about the implications of this proposed tourist tax,"" she stated. McVey explained that the funds raised would contribute towards improving the city's infrastructure, such as public transportation and cultural attractions. ""Edinburgh receives millions of tourists every year, and it's only fair that they contribute to the upkeep of the city,"" he said. Hyslop acknowledged the potential benefits but emphasised the importance of consultation and collaboration with the Scottish Government and the industry. ""I encourage the council to engage in dialogue with stakeholders and discuss alternative funding options,"" she suggested. Some hoteliers and tour operators have voiced their opposition to the proposed tax, arguing that it could deter visitors and negatively impact the industry. ""A Â£1 increase in hotel bills might not seem significant to locals, but it could be a deterrent for budget-conscious travellers,"" said John Doe, the manager of a budget hotel in the city centre. The Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) also weighed in on the debate, urging the council to reconsider its decision. ""The STA strongly opposes any tax that could negatively affect the competitiveness of Scotland's tourism industry,"" said Marc Crothall, the organisation's Chief Executive. The council has yet to announce a decision on the matter, stating that they are open to feedback from stakeholders. The Scottish Government has confirmed that it will not intervene in the council's decision-making process, leaving it up to the council to weigh the potential benefits against the potential drawbacks. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether Edinburgh will join the ranks of European cities such as Barcelona, Paris, and Bruges in implementing a tourist tax. One thing is certain: the future of tourism in Edinburgh and the potential impact on local services and the industry are at stake.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid in Scotland: First screening site opens at Edinburgh airport,"Passengers and staff at Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are now able to undergo Covid-19 PCR testing onsite before departing or upon arrival, making it the first airport screening site in the country. This new initiative, introduced in collaboration with the healthcare company Cignpost, aims to provide added peace of mind and help prevent the spread of the virus. Airport managers expressed their belief that this move could help reduce the risk of infected individuals entering or leaving the country undetected, thereby contributing to the overall public health efforts in Scotland. The facility is conveniently located in the arrivals hall, making it easily accessible for both inbound and outbound travellers. Passengers and members of the public can pay for the tests, which will be processed at the lab located off-site. The results will be provided the next day, either via email or text message, allowing individuals to plan accordingly for their journeys. It is important to note that these tests are not a replacement for the mandatory pre-departure negative Covid-19 test and the ongoing requirement for travellers to self-isolate upon arrival in Scotland. The new testing site is expected to process up to 1,000 tests per day, with plans to expand capacity as demand increases. This number is a significant improvement compared to the current capacity of around 400 tests per day at various testing centres across Edinburgh. Scotland's Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson, stated that the introduction of Covid-19 testing at the airport is a ""welcome development"" and a ""key step forward"" in the country's efforts to manage the ongoing pandemic. He further emphasized the importance of adhering to public health guidelines, such as wearing masks and social distancing, to protect both airport staff and passengers. Other major airports in the United Kingdom, such as Heathrow and Gatwick, have also introduced on-site testing facilities for Covid-19. These tests can help travellers meet the testing requirements of various destinations and mitigate the risk of spreading or contracting the virus while travelling. In conclusion, the opening of the first Covid-19 testing site at Edinburgh Airport represents a significant milestone in Scotland's fight against the pandemic. The facility offers added convenience and peace of mind for passengers and staff, as well as contributing to the national effort to prevent the spread of the virus. As travel restrictions continue to evolve, it is essential that individuals remain informed and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety and the safety of those around them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Depression: 'Mindfulness-based therapy shows promise',"By Smitha Mundasad, Health reporter, BBC News Depression is a debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Traditional treatments, such as antidepressant medication and talk therapy, have long been the go-to options for managing the symptoms of this often-stigmatized illness. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that mindfulness-based therapy could be an effective alternative or complementary approach to these traditional interventions. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a type of mindfulness practice that has shown promise in preventing relapses in individuals with a history of depression. In a recent study, scientists at the University of Exeter tested MBCT against antidepressant pills for people at risk of relapse and found it worked just as well. MBCT is an eight-week group intervention that trains people to focus their minds and understand that negative thoughts may come but they do not have to act on them. Participants learn various mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, body scanning, and loving-kindness meditation, to help them become more aware of their thoughts and emotions without judgment. The therapy is based on the principles of mindfulness meditation, which has been practiced for thousands of years in various forms of Buddhist tradition. However, MBCT has been adapted to suit the modern context of mental health treatment, making it accessible to a wider audience. One of the key reasons why MBCT has gained popularity is its focus on the present moment. Unlike traditional psychotherapies that focus on analyzing past experiences, MBCT encourages individuals to focus on the present moment and learn how to respond to their thoughts and emotions in a more adaptive way. The study, published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, followed 156 individuals who had previously experienced depression. The participants were randomly assigned to either receive MBCT or antidepressant medication. The results showed that both interventions were equally effective in preventing relapses over a one-year period. Moreover, MBCT has several advantages over antidepressant medication. For one, it is a non-pharmacological intervention, which means it does not come with the side effects associated with antidepressants. Additionally, MBCT has been shown to have long-lasting effects, with some studies suggesting that the benefits can persist for up to five years after the therapy has ended. The study's lead author, Dr. Mathew Baldwin, said, ""Our findings provide strong evidence that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is an effective treatment to prevent relapse in depression, and this effect is sustained over a year."" The results of this study add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of mindfulness-based interventions in mental health treatment. It is important to note, however, that MBCT is not a panacea and is not suitable for everyone. It is always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Germany trial: 'Far-right' gunman denies police murder,"Wolfgang P, a 49-year-old German man, stood trial in a packed courtroom on charges of murdering a police officer. The defendant, dressed in a grey jumpsuit, listened intently as the prosecutor outlined the events that led to the tragic incident. The alleged crime took place last October during an early-morning police raid at Wolfgang's residence in the small town of Bamberg. The officer, identified only as Herr M, was part of a team that had obtained a search warrant based on information suggesting illegal firearms were stored at the premises. According to the prosecution, Herr M and his colleagues approached the house at around 6:00 am. Knocks on the door were met with silence, and after waiting for a reasonable amount of time, the team made the decision to force entry. With the consent of a superior officer, they used a battering ram to break down the front door. As the door gave way, shots rang out. Herr M, who was leading the team, was struck in the chest and collapsed. The team returned fire, and Wolfgang was later identified as the shooter by witness statements and forensic evidence. In his defense, Wolfgang alleged that he had acted in self-defense. He claimed that he had been awakened by the commotion outside his home and, fearing for his life, grabbed his gun and opened fire through the door. He maintained that he believed intruders were trying to break into his house. During the trial, the court heard testimony from the investigating officers, ballistics experts, and witnesses. Medical evidence also suggested that Herr M had been shot from a distance, further corroborating the defendant's account of events. However, the prosecution argued that the presence of illegal firearms in Wolfgang's home, as well as his history of far-right political activism, painted a different picture. They pointed to his previous convictions for hate speech and incitement to violence, suggesting that Wolfgang had a propensity for violence and that his actions on the day of the shooting were not those of an innocent homeowner. As the trial progressed, it became clear that this was not a straightforward case of self-defense. The court would have to weigh the evidence carefully and consider the background of the defendant, as well as the circumstances surrounding the shooting, in order to reach a fair and just verdict. The trial continued, with both sides presenting their closing arguments and the judge retiring to consider the evidence before delivering his ruling. The outcome would not only determine the fate of Wolfgang P but also send a message to the wider community about the importance of the rule of law and the dangers of hate speech and far-right extremism.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hong Kong 'Umbrella' protesters sentenced to jail terms,"Four others received suspended sentences on Wednesday, while one had their sentencing deferred until June, as the legal proceedings against the Hong Kong ""Umbrella Movement"" activists continued. The nine individuals were found guilty earlier this month over their involvement in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, which brought vast numbers of people onto the streets of the city for over two months. The nine activists, who were mostly young, included student leaders, social workers, and labor organizers, were charged with various offenses, including inciting others to incite others to commit subversion, inciting others to obstruct roads, and organizing an unlawful assembly. They were arrested during the height of the protests, which began in late September 2014 and were sparked by Beijing's decision to restrict democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous city. The sentencing came after a week-long trial that saw emotional testimonies from the defendants, as well as from their supporters, who packed the courtroom each day. The activists argued that their actions were driven by a genuine desire to defend the city's democratic freedoms, which they felt were under threat from Beijing's interference. The judge, however, rejected their arguments, saying that the protests had disrupted the city's peace and order for too long and had caused significant economic damage. He also criticized the activists for their refusal to cooperate with the police during the protests, describing their actions as ""obstructive and confrontational."" The sentencing of the activists has sparked widespread criticism from human rights organizations, as well as from many in Hong Kong society, who see the harsh sentences as a sign of Beijing's increasing authoritarianism. The European Union, the United States, and other countries have also expressed their concerns, calling on the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities to respect the city's legal and political autonomy. The activists, who have been hailed as heroes by many in Hong Kong, have vowed to continue their fight for democracy, despite their imprisonment. Some have called for a renewed wave of protests, while others have urged their supporters to channel their energy into peaceful political activism. The ""Umbrella Movement,"" named for the umbrellas used by protesters to shield themselves from the frequent downpours, was the largest pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong's history. It brought together people from all walks of life, from students and workers to professionals and the elderly, in a united call for democratic reforms and greater political freedoms. Despite the sentencing of the activists, the movement's legacy endures, with many in Hong Kong continuing to push for greater political representation and greater democratic freedoms.

Nearly 100 subsidised bus routes cut in Wales in 2011-14,"The figures obtained by BBC Wales reveal that nearly one in seven bus routes across 19 council areas in Wales have been cut since 2011, amounting to almost 100 subsidised services. This drastic reduction has led to concerns about the impact on older people and those in rural areas who rely heavily on public transport. Age Cymru, the charity representing older people in Wales, warned of the potential consequences this could have on the elderly population. They expressed concern that older people may become increasingly isolated due to the lack of accessible transport options. According to Age Cymru, buses are a lifeline for many older people who rely on them to attend medical appointments, social events, and essential shopping trips. The charity's Chief Executive, Victoria Lloyd, said, ""Losing these bus services will make it much harder for older people to get out and about, to see friends and family and to access the shops and services they need."" The Welsh Government acknowledged the impact of the cuts on older people, stating that it was working to mitigate the effects. A spokesperson for the government said, ""We understand the importance of bus services for older people and for those in rural areas. That is why we are investing Â£7 million this year to maintain and improve subsidised bus services."" However, Age Cymru argued that more needs to be done to address the long-term sustainability of bus services in Wales. They called for a comprehensive review of the bus network and the introduction of measures to increase revenue streams, such as concessionary fares for older people and the implementation of bus priority schemes. The impact of the bus cuts is not limited to older people. Rural communities in particular are facing significant challenges due to the reduction in services. The lack of public transport options in these areas can result in isolation, limited access to essential services, and increased reliance on cars, which can be expensive and contribute to carbon emissions. The Welsh Government has acknowledged the importance of bus services in rural areas and has pledged to invest in new initiatives to improve connectivity. One such initiative is the implementation of community transport schemes, which aim to provide transport solutions for people living in areas with limited bus services. Despite these efforts, the scale of the bus cuts in Wales remains a cause for concern. Age Cymru and other organisations are calling for a long-term solution to the funding crisis and for the Welsh Government to prioritise the sustainability of bus services as a key component of its transport policy. In the meantime, older people and those in rural areas will continue to face challenges in accessing essential services and maintaining social connections. The impact of the bus cuts is a reminder of the importance of a comprehensive and accessible transport network for all members of society.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cancer awareness 'low in black and South Asian groups',"By Smitha Mundasad, Health reporter, BBC News The study of nearly 50,000 people, published in the British Journal of Cancer, found those with a black ethnic background were least likely to recognise a persistent cough as a possible symptom of cancer. South Asian groups also had lower awareness levels than the white British population. The research, carried out by Public Health England and Cancer Research UK, showed that while 85% of white British people identified a persistent cough as a potential cancer sign, only 72% of black people and 75% of South Asians did so. The findings add to growing concerns that cancer awareness is significantly lower among black and South Asian communities, increasing the risk of late diagnosis and poorer outcomes. Dr Harpal Kumar, CEO of Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's really important that we understand the reasons behind these differences and take action to address them. Late diagnosis can make it harder to treat cancer effectively and increase the risk of death."" The study also highlighted other symptoms where awareness was lower among black and South Asian groups, including unexplained weight loss, changes in bowel habits and abdominal pain. Dr Jasmeet Soar, a consultant in public health at Public Health England, said: ""We know that cancer affects everyone, but unfortunately, minority ethnic groups often face unique challenges when it comes to prevention, early detection and access to treatment. This includes lower awareness of cancer symptoms and risk factors."" The study comes as the NHS launches a new campaign to encourage more people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds to attend cancer screenings. The 'Be Clear on Cancer' campaign aims to challenge common misconceptions and increase awareness of the importance of early detection. Dr Amelia Lake, a GP and chair of the BMA's Ethnic Minority and International Medical Students Association, said: ""We know that cancer affects everyone, but it's important that we recognise the specific challenges faced by black and minority ethnic communities. This includes addressing language barriers, cultural differences and mistrust of the healthcare system."" The study also highlighted the need for more research into the reasons behind lower cancer awareness in black and South Asian communities. Possible factors include language barriers, cultural beliefs, and mistrust of the healthcare system. Dr Kumar added: ""We need to work together to tackle these inequalities and ensure that everyone in our communities has the information they need to protect themselves from cancer. This includes improving access to cancer information in multiple languages, and working with community leaders and organisations to promote cancer awareness and early detection."" The study is a stark reminder that more needs to be done to address the inequalities in cancer awareness and diagnosis among black and South Asian communities.

Durham neo-Nazi teenager detained for terror attack plan,"The now 17-year-old wrote about an ""inevitable race war"" in his diary and listed locations from his home city of Durham in a ""guerrilla warfare"" manual. A jury had found the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty of preparing terrorist acts at Newcastle Crown Court last week. The court heard how the teenager, who was just 14 when he began writing the diary entries, had expressed extreme hate-filled views towards ethnic minorities and Jews. His writings included plans for attacks on specific locations in Durham, as well as detailed instructions on how to make explosives and weapons. The boy's defence team argued that he had no intention of carrying out any attacks, and that his writings were merely the ""fantasies of a disturbed young man."" However, the prosecution presented evidence that the teenager had been in contact with far-right groups and had attempted to purchase weapons online. One of the prosecution witnesses, a teacher at the boy's school, testified that he had expressed racist views in class and had made threats against students from ethnic minority backgrounds. The teacher also spoke of how the boy had been isolated and bullied, and how he had become increasingly radicalised online. The jury took just over two hours to reach their verdict, finding the boy guilty on all counts. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced later this year. The case has shocked the community in Durham, with local residents expressing their disbelief and disappointment at the news. Durham Constabulary have reassured the public that they are taking the threat seriously and have increased patrols in the area. The boy's conviction comes at a time when there is growing concern about the rise of far-right extremism in the UK. According to the National Police Chiefs' Council, there has been a 30% increase in hate crimes reported in the last year, with many of these crimes motivated by race or religion. The Government has pledged to tackle the problem, with Home Secretary Priti Patel announcing a new strategy to combat extremism and hate crime. The strategy includes increased funding for police forces to tackle hate crime, as well as measures to prevent radicalisation and promote community cohesion. However, some experts warn that more needs to be done to address the root causes of extremism, such as poverty, social exclusion, and lack of education. They also call for greater efforts to challenge the far-right narrative and promote tolerance and understanding in schools and communities. As the case of the Durham teenager highlights, the threat of far-right extremism is a real and growing concern in the UK. It is essential that we all work together to challenge hate speech and promote inclusivity and diversity, to ensure that our communities remain safe and cohesive for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Safoora Zargar: Bail for pregnant India student blamed for Delhi riots,"She was more than three months pregnant when she was arrested in April, a stark contrast to the accusations leveled against her. The police, in their relentless pursuit of those responsible for the anti-Muslim riots that swept Delhi in February, had branded her a ""key conspirator."" Fifty-three people had lost their lives in the chaos that ensued, and the authorities were determined to bring those responsible to justice. However, Ms. Safoora Zargar's family vehemently denied the allegations. Ms. Zargar, a 27-year-old student from India's Jamia Millia Islamia University, was taken into custody under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), a draconian law that allows for extended detention without trial. Her arrest sparked widespread protests, with activists and students taking to the streets to demand her release. The hashtag #FreeSafoora trended on social media, as people expressed their concern for her welfare and the fairness of the charges against her. As her pregnancy progressed, Ms. Zargar's situation grew increasingly precarious. Prison authorities refused to grant her bail, citing the gravity of the charges against her as reason enough to keep her in custody. However, human rights activists and organizations, including Amnesty International, Amnesty India, and the People's Union for Civil Liberties, argued that denying her bail on the grounds of her pregnancy was a violation of her fundamental rights. The Delhi High Court finally intervened, granting Ms. Zargar bail on compassionate grounds on May 8. In its order, the court noted that the ""pregnant woman is a vulnerable adult who requires special care and protection, especially during this critical period of her life."" The court also expressed concern that Ms. Zargar's detention could lead to ""irreparable harm"" to her health and that of her unborn child. Despite her release, Ms. Zargar's ordeal was far from over. She was ordered to report to the police station every day and was banned from leaving Delhi without permission. The conditions of her bail were stringent, but Ms. Zargar and her supporters saw it as a victory. The incident served as a reminder of the need to protect the rights of pregnant women, particularly those who are detained or face criminal charges. It also highlighted the importance of fair and impartial justice, especially in the face of communal tensions. Ms. Zargar's case also underscored the need for greater accountability and transparency in the application of the UAPA, a law that has been used to silence dissent and stifle free speech in India. As Ms. Zargar continued to fight for her rights and the safety of her child, many watched with bated breath, hoping for a just outcome in her case. The",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stanford rape case Judge Aaron Persky faces recall petition,"Community leaders from Santa Clara County filed a notice of intention on Monday to collect signatures to recall Judge Aaron Persky next year. Judge Persky was accused of showing leniency in a high-profile rape case that has sparked widespread controversy and protests. The case involved Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student, who was found guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman behind a dumpster in 2015. Persky sentenced Turner to six months in county jail and three years of probation, a decision that was widely criticized as too lenient given the nature of the crime. The victim's powerful statement during the sentencing hearing, in which she spoke of the profound impact the assault had on her life, went viral and garnered international attention. The recall effort, which was initiated by the Santa Clara Women's Political Caucus, argues that Persky's handling of the case demonstrated a lack of understanding for the severity of sexual assault and a disregard for the needs of victims. The group plans to collect the necessary 58,634 signatures from registered voters in Santa Clara County to trigger a recall election. The movement to recall Persky has gained momentum in recent weeks, with local and national organizations, as well as individual citizens, expressing their support. The Stanford University community, which was deeply affected by the assault, has been particularly vocal in its calls for Persky's removal. ""We cannot continue to have a judge who does not take sexual assault seriously,"" said Teresa Huang, a spokesperson for the Santa Clara Women's Political Caucus. ""Judge Persky's actions send a dangerous message that the justice system does not take rape seriously enough. We need a judge who understands the devastating impact of sexual assault on victims and their families."" The recall effort has also attracted the attention of national organizations, including the National Organization for Women (NOW), which has pledged its support. ""We stand with the victims and survivors of sexual assault in Santa Clara County and across the country,"" said Toni Van Pelt, president of NOW. ""Judge Persky's actions were a slap in the face to survivors and a failure of the justice system. We will do everything in our power to help remove him from the bench."" The recall petition is not the only effort to hold Persky accountable for his handling of the Turner case. The victim, whose identity has not been made public, is suing Persky and the Stanford University administration for their responses to her assault. The lawsuit alleges that both Persky and the university failed to protect her from further harm and violated her civil rights. As the recall effort gains steam, Persky's future on the bench remains uncertain. In a statement, Persky defended his decision, arguing that it was based on the facts of the case and the law. However, the controversy surrounding the sentence has raised questions about his ability to",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Muslim families sending children to Catholic schools,"By Sean Coughlan, Education correspondent For the first time, an annual census of Catholic schools has collected information on the number of pupils from other religions. The biggest group of non-Catholic pupils are from other Muslim families. This trend reflects the growing diversity of many urban areas, where Catholic schools, with their longstanding traditions and strong community support, are attracting families from a range of backgrounds. The census, published by the Catholic Education Service, shows that over 3,000 Muslim pupils were enrolled in Catholic schools last year, accounting for about 1% of the total student population. The reasons for this phenomenon are varied, ranging from the desire for a high-quality education to the search for a welcoming school community. One factor is the reputation of Catholic schools for academic rigour. They often rank among the top performers in league tables, attracting families who value excellence in education. Another factor is the sense of belonging and community that Catholic schools offer. Many have a strong pastoral care system, focusing on individual pupils and their well-being. This is particularly important for Muslim families, who may feel isolated in areas with few other Muslim schools. They value the opportunity for their children to learn in a supportive environment where their faith and cultural identity are respected. Catholic schools have a long history of welcoming pupils from different backgrounds. They pride themselves on their inclusive ethos, which emphasizes the shared values of respect, tolerance, and mutual understanding. However, this trend is not without challenges. Some Muslim families may face difficulties in reconciling the teaching of their faith with the Catholic curriculum, particularly in areas such as religious education and sex education. To address these concerns, Catholic schools have been working to develop a more flexible and inclusive approach to religious education. They offer a range of options, allowing families to choose the approach that best suits their beliefs and values. Moreover, Catholic schools have been embracing the opportunity to learn from each other. They are fostering interfaith dialogue and partnerships, enabling pupils to deepen their understanding of different faiths and cultures. The growing diversity of Catholic schools is not just a reflection of changing demographics, but a sign of their adaptability and resilience. They are evolving to meet the needs of modern society, while remaining true to their core mission of providing a high-quality education rooted in Christian values. In conclusion, the census figures highlight an intriguing trend in English education: the increasing number of Muslim families sending their children to Catholic schools. This trend reflects the growing diversity of urban areas and the adaptability of Catholic schools in responding to the changing needs of their communities. It is a testament to the enduring appeal of Catholic education and the power of inclusive, welcoming school communities to bring people together.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Isa Muazu: Nigeria to accept UK deportee's plane,"Isa Muazu, a Nigerian national who had been living in the United Kingdom, was returned to British soil on Friday after a privately chartered jet that was scheduled to take him back to Nigeria was turned back. According to officials, the relevant documents for the flight were found to be incomplete or invalid, leading to the plane's denial of entry into Nigerian airspace. Muazu, who had reportedly been granted permission to return to Nigeria by the Nigerian authorities following a prison sentence served in the UK, was met with disappointment and frustration upon learning of the plane's turnback. He had been looking forward to reuniting with his family and starting a new chapter in his life in Nigeria. The incident has caused a stir both in Nigeria and the UK, with some expressing concern over the lack of transparency and communication between the two countries' authorities regarding the matter. Muazu's case is not an isolated one, as there have been previous instances of Nigerian deportees being stranded in the UK due to similar issues with travel documents. The Nigerian High Commission in London has issued a statement expressing regret over the situation and assuring Muazu and his family that every effort would be made to facilitate his travel to Nigeria as soon as possible. The Commission also urged Nigerians in the Diaspora to ensure that all travel documents are in order before making travel arrangements. Meanwhile, the UK Home Office has issued a statement confirming that Muazu had been deported in accordance with the law and that all necessary arrangements were made for his travel to Nigeria. The statement also reminded Nigerians living in the UK of their responsibilities to ensure that they have valid travel documents before making travel plans. Muazu's case highlights the need for improved coordination and communication between the Nigerian and UK authorities to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. It also underscores the importance of Nigerians in the Diaspora taking responsibility for their travel arrangements and ensuring that they have all necessary documents before making travel plans. As Muazu awaits the next steps in his journey back to Nigeria, he is left to reflect on the unexpected turn of events. Despite the setback, he remains hopeful that he will soon be reunited with his family and begin the next chapter of his life in his native country. In the meantime, efforts are being made to resolve the issue and bring closure to this unfortunate situation. It is hoped that this incident will serve as a catalyst for improved cooperation between the Nigerian and UK authorities, and a reminder to all travellers to take their travel arrangements seriously.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Badger cull: Queen's Brian May praises Welsh government for halting plan,"The Queen guitarist and badger campaigner, Brian May, has praised the Welsh government for its decision to halt the planned badger cull in Wales. In a statement released through his Save Me charity, May congratulated Environment Minister John Griffiths and said he had made a ""courageous decision"" in the face of strong opposition. May, who is known for his activism against the culling of badgers to reduce bovine tuberculosis in cattle, expressed his appreciation for the minister's commitment to finding alternative methods to control the disease. ""I'm delighted to hear this news,"" May said. ""John Griffiths has shown real leadership in his approach to this issue, and I commend him for his determination to find a humane and effective solution to bovine TB."" The proposed badger cull in Wales had sparked controversy and strong opposition from animal welfare groups, including May's charity. The campaigners argued that the cull would not only be ineffective in controlling bovine TB but also cruel and inhumane. May added that the decision to halt the cull was a ""great victory for common sense and compassion"". He also urged the Welsh government to continue its efforts to find alternative methods to control bovine TB, such as vaccination and improved cattle testing and management. The Welsh government had announced its decision to halt the cull following a review of the evidence and consultation with experts. In a statement, the government said it would instead focus on improving testing and surveillance of cattle and exploring other options to control bovine TB. May's praise for the Welsh government's decision came as a relief to animal welfare groups, who had been campaigning against the cull for months. The RSPCA, one of the leading animal welfare organizations in the UK, welcomed the news and called on the UK government to follow suit and abandon its plans for a badger cull in England. The badger cull has been a contentious issue in the UK for decades, with strong opinions on both sides. While some argue that culling is necessary to control bovine TB and prevent the suffering of cattle, others believe that it is an unnecessary and inhumane practice that causes needless suffering to badgers. May's activism against the badger cull has earned him a reputation as a leading animal welfare campaigner and a voice for the voiceless. His charity, Save Me, has been at the forefront of the campaign against the cull, using social media, protests, and lobbying to raise awareness of the issue and influence government policy. As the debate over the badger cull continues, May and his charity will no doubt continue their efforts to promote compassionate and effective solutions to bovine TB and other animal welfare issues. And with the Welsh government's decision to halt the cull, there is renewed hope that a hum",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Germany strikes explained: The long and the short of it,"This week, thousands of German workers took to the streets in a series of coordinated strikes across various industries. The action was in response to proposed labor reforms that workers and unions fear could lead to the erosion of job security and wages. This week's strikes could be the first of many, as labor unions have threatened further action if their demands are not met. But why do these strikes matter, and what do they say about Germany in 2018? In the simplified version, the strikes represent a fundamental clash between labor and capital. Workers, represented by powerful unions, are pushing back against proposed reforms that they believe would weaken their bargaining power and lead to job losses. Businesses and politicians, on the other hand, argue that the reforms are necessary to make Germany's labor market more flexible and competitive. The longer version of the story delves deeper into the context and implications of the strikes. Germany has long been known for its robust and stable labor market, built on a strong social safety net and a cooperative relationship between labor and management. However, in recent years, this model has come under pressure from globalization, automation, and demographic changes. The proposed labor reforms, which include measures to make it easier to lay off workers and to reduce the power of unions in collective bargaining, are seen by many as an attempt to modernize the German labor market and make it more adaptable to the changing economic landscape. However, workers and unions fear that these reforms could lead to job losses and a weakening of wage protections, particularly for the most vulnerable workers. The strikes, which have disrupted transportation, construction, and other industries, have sparked heated debate in Germany. Some see them as a necessary show of force to defend workers' rights and protections, while others view them as an obstacle to needed reforms and a threat to economic growth. The strikes also come at a time when Germany is facing other challenges, including a rising far-right movement, tensions with its European neighbors over migration, and uncertainty over its role in the global economy. As such, the strikes are not just a labor dispute, but a reflection of broader social and economic trends in Germany and beyond. In the end, the outcome of the strikes remains to be seen. Whether they will lead to significant concessions from the government and employers, or simply serve as a warning shot, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the strikes are a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle between labor and capital, and the complex and evolving nature of the German labor market in 2018.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rag'n'Bone Man: New songs for Record Store Day 2018,"By Jimmy Blake, Newsbeat reporter Now in its 11th year, the Record Store Day event continues to celebrate local, independent record stores and the unique role they play in the music industry. This year, Rag'n'Bone Man has joined the celebrations by recording two new songs directly to vinyl. The singer-songwriter, whose real name is Rory Graham, is known for his soulful voice and introspective lyrics. His debut album, ""Human,"" was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one in the UK charts. Speaking to Newsbeat, Rag'n'Bone Man explained how he came to be involved in the Record Store Day project: ""I've always loved the idea of Record Store Day, it's all about supporting local businesses and keeping the art of buying physical music alive. When I was approached about recording some new songs for it, I jumped at the chance."" The two new tracks, ""Don't Set The World On Fire"" and ""George Has,"" were recorded at RAK Studios in London. Both songs are exclusive to this vinyl release and are not available digitally or on CD. ""Don't Set The World On Fire"" is a powerful ballad with Rag'n'Bone Man's distinctive voice soaring over a sparse instrumental arrangement. The lyrics speak of love and the desire to hold onto it, even in the face of adversity. The second track, ""George Has,"" is a more upbeat number with a catchy chorus. It tells the story of a man named George who has lost everything but refuses to give up. Rag'n'Bone Man's vocals are once again at the forefront, delivering a heartfelt performance. When asked about the inspiration behind the songs, Rag'n'Bone Man replied: ""These songs are about the human condition, about love and loss and the struggles we all face in life. I wanted to write something that people could relate to and that would make them feel something."" The Record Store Day vinyl release also includes liner notes written by Rag'n'Bone Man, giving insight into the background of each song and the thought process behind their creation. Fans of Rag'n'Bone Man will be able to get their hands on the vinyl at participating record stores on Record Store Day, which takes place on April 21, 2018. It's a rare opportunity to own some exclusive new music from one of the UK's most popular artists, and a great reminder of the importance of supporting local businesses and the unique role they play in the music industry.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Andrew Lloyd Webber: Arts at risk over austerity cuts,"Speaking at the House of Lords, Lord Lloyd-Webber expressed deep concern over the impact of austerity cuts on the arts sector, warning that the sector was being put at risk by policies introduced in recent years. The renowned composer and impresario, who has made a significant contribution to British theatre through productions like ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" ""Evita,"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" voiced his worries over shrinking budgets and the increasing difficulty in securing funding for arts projects. Lord Lloyd-Webber highlighted the importance of the arts, not just as a source of entertainment but also as a vital part of the country's cultural identity and economic growth. He emphasized that investing in the arts benefits society in numerous ways, from boosting tourism to providing education and employment opportunities, especially for young people. The government's austerity measures, Lord Lloyd-Webber explained, have led to significant budget cuts for arts organizations, forcing many to close their doors or face an uncertain future. He pointed out that despite the challenges, the arts sector has continued to adapt and innovate, but the current financial situation threatens its very existence. Lord Lloyd-Webber urged the government to reconsider its approach to arts funding and to recognize the long-term benefits of investing in the sector. He argued that the arts are not a luxury, but a necessity that enriches our lives and strengthens our communities, particularly in these challenging times. The composer called on arts organizations, too, to be more proactive in seeking alternative sources of funding and to collaborate more closely with each other and with businesses and educational institutions. He acknowledged that the situation is complex and that there is no easy solution, but stressed that the importance of the arts cannot be overlooked. Lord Lloyd-Webber's words came as part of a broader debate in the House of Lords on the future of the arts in the UK. The discussion saw contributions from other peers, who shared Lord Lloyd-Webber's concerns and offered their own perspectives on how to safeguard the future of the arts. As the debate came to a close, it was clear that the issue of arts funding and the impact of austerity cuts was one that continued to resonate deeply with many in the chamber. The future of the arts in the UK remains uncertain, but with voices like Lord Lloyd-Webber's speaking out, there is hope that the sector will continue to thrive and adapt, despite the challenges it faces.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Emiliano Sala: No further action after manslaughter arrest,"The Argentine striker, 28, was killed in a plane crash along with pilot David Ibbotson just two days after signing for Cardiff City in January 2019. The tragic accident occurred over the English Channel, leaving the football community in shock and grief. Following an extensive investigation, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) announced that they were bringing manslaughter charges against the plane's owner, David Henderson, in relation to the incident. The AAIB alleged that Mr Henderson had knowingly sent the aircraft on a journey that it was not safe to make. The news of the manslaughter charges sent ripples through the football world and beyond. The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson, along with the wider public, waited with bated breath for the legal proceedings to unfold. However, on 11 March 2021, almost two years after the crash, it was announced that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would not be pursuing the case further. In a statement, the CPS said that ""there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in this case."" The decision not to proceed with the manslaughter charges was met with disappointment and anger from the Sala family and their supporters. Lawyers for the family criticised the CPS for not providing enough evidence to support the charges, and called for a review of the case. Despite the CPS decision, the investigation into the crash continued. The AAIB published a report in July 2021, detailing their findings and offering recommendations for future aviation safety. The report concluded that the cause of the crash was likely to be the loss of engine power due to an unsecured fuel tank in the plane's right wing. Emiliano Sala's tragic death continues to cast a shadow over the football world, and his memory lives on through the impact he had on those around him. Cardiff City retired his squad number, 26, in his honour, and his former teammates and fans paid tribute to him in various ways. The case also highlighted the importance of aviation safety and the need for thorough investigations to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. The memory of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson continues to serve as a reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of taking every precaution to ensure safety. In the end, no legal action was taken against those involved in the crash, leaving many questions unanswered and a sense of injustice amongst those affected. The Sala family and their supporters remain determined to keep his memory alive and to ensure that his legacy lives on, both on and off the football field.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Vodafone error sees customers hit by thousands in charges,"Customers took to Twitter in frustration, expressing their concern after encountering issues with their Vodafone mobile services. Reports indicated that numerous users were unable to use their phones, adding to their distress as they couldn't reach out to the operator for assistance. The situation worsened when many received alerts from Vodafone stating that their data had run out, despite the fact that some still had data remaining in their accounts. The Unexpected Charges: The unexpected data usage charges began piling up for affected customers, leaving them bewildered and angered. Some users reported being charged thousands of pounds, far exceeding their monthly data limits. The error appeared to affect a significant number of Vodafone customers, leading to widespread concern and dissatisfaction. The Response from Vodafone: Vodafone acknowledged the issue and assured its customers that they were working to resolve the problem as soon as possible. The telecom giant issued a statement, saying, ""We're aware of an issue affecting some of our customers' data allowances, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused. We're working to fix this as quickly as possible."" The Root Cause: Although the exact cause of the issue remained unclear at the time, some speculation pointed towards a possible software glitch or a network configuration problem. Vodafone's engineering team worked around the clock to diagnose and address the root cause of the problem. Offering Compensation: In an attempt to ease the anger and frustration of its customers, Vodafone announced that it would be offering compensation to those who had been unfairly charged due to the error. The telecom company did not specify the exact form of compensation, but it was expected to cover the excessive charges incurred by the affected customers. Awaiting a Solution: As Vodafone continued to investigate the issue, customers were left to cope with the unexpected charges and service disruptions. The situation served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining open communication between telecom companies and their customers during times of service disruptions and unexpected charges. In the meantime, affected customers were encouraged to reach out to Vodafone's customer service team for assistance and to monitor their accounts closely for any further unusual activity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Savile: Knighthood committee 'told about abuse in 1998',"The head of the Honours Committee, Sir Robert Balchin, vigorously defended his decision not to recommend Jimmy Savile for a knighthood in 1998, despite intense lobbying from the media personality and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Letters obtained by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse reveal that Balchin was unequivocal in his refusal to bow to the pressure. Balchin's stance was based on concerns regarding Savile's reputation and behaviour, which had long been a subject of rumour and speculation. According to the documents, Balchin had been made aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against Savile, including allegations of improper behaviour towards young girls at the BBC. Despite this knowledge, Savile continued to use his position of influence and power to lobby for a knighthood. Thatcher, who was a close friend of Savile, reportedly wrote to Balchin on his behalf in 1997, urging him to consider the honour. Savile's request was denied, but the former prime minister continued to press the issue, writing again in 1998. Balchin's letters to Thatcher, which were written in response to her interventions, reveal the depth of his concerns about Savile. He wrote that he had already rejected a request for a knighthood from Savile in 1992, citing ""serious concerns"" about his reputation. Balchin also wrote that he had received a letter from a member of the public detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against Savile, which he had passed on to the Metropolitan Police. Despite these warnings, Savile continued to enjoy a high public profile and was even given access to children through his work with charity organizations. It was not until after his death in 2011 that the true extent of his crimes came to light. Hundreds of victims have since come forward, alleging that they were sexually abused by Savile over several decades. The revelation that Balchin was aware of allegations against Savile in 1998 is likely to fuel calls for a wider investigation into how the BBC and other institutions handled allegations of sexual misconduct against high-profile figures. The inquiry, which is being led by Dame Lowell Goddard, is expected to publish its findings later this year. Balchin passed away in 2007, and it is unclear whether he ever regretted his decision not to recommend Savile for a knighthood. What is clear, however, is that his actions may have prevented Savile from being further honoured by the state, and may have saved some children from being exposed to the predator. The letters obtained by the inquiry provide a chilling insight into the lengths that Savile went to in order to secure a knighthood, and the complicity of",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Insurers warn of travel premium rise,"By Simon Gompertz, Personal Finance Correspondent, BBC News Next Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce the easing of restrictions on international travel. For many Britons, this long-awaited news will come as a welcome relief, providing much-needed respite from the monotony of lockdown life. However, for those planning to take to the skies or set sail on a much-deserved holiday, there could be an unwelcome additional cost. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has warned that travel insurance premiums could rise significantly. The ABI, which represents almost all of the UK's insurers, has written to the government, urging ministers to take action to prevent a ""significant increase"" in premiums. The organisation estimates that the cost of travel insurance could rise by as much as Â£50 per policy. This hike would be a direct result of the increased risks associated with travel during the ongoing pandemic. The ABI's concerns are based on the fact that the UK's travel corridor list - which determines which countries are considered safe for travel without the need to quarantine on return - is subject to change at short notice. This uncertainty makes it difficult for insurers to accurately price travel insurance policies. Furthermore, the ABI has expressed its disappointment that the government has not yet provided clarity on the requirement for travellers to have proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test before returning to the UK. The organisation argues that this lack of clarity is making it difficult for insurers to provide adequate cover for travellers. The ABI is also calling on the government to provide financial support to insurers, in the form of a reinsurance scheme, to help manage the increased risk associated with travel insurance policies. Such a scheme would help to stabilise premiums and make travel insurance more affordable for consumers. The ABI's warning comes as the travel industry gears up for a summer season like no other. Airlines and travel firms have reported a surge in bookings as people look to make up for lost time. However, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding travel restrictions and the cost of travel insurance, many people may be forced to reconsider their holiday plans. For those who do decide to travel, the ABI is urging them to shop around for the best deals on travel insurance. The organisation's research suggests that prices can vary significantly between insurers, with some offering cover for as little as Â£10 per policy. In conclusion, as the UK prepares to open its borders to international travel, insurers are warning that the cost of travel insurance could rise significantly. The ABI is calling on the government to provide clarity on travel restrictions and to provide financial support to insurers to help manage the increased risk associated with travel insurance policies. In the meantime, consumers are being urged to shop around for the best deals on travel insurance to help keep the cost of their holidays",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Austria election: 'Grand coalition' can rule again,"Following a closely contested Austrian election, it appears that the Grand Coalition, composed of the Social Democrats (SPOe) and the People's Party (OeVP), is set to return to power. Though the SPOe emerged as the largest party with 27.4% of the votes, there was a significant surge in support for the Eurosceptic right-wing Freedom Party (FPOe), which gained 21.4% of the votes. The Green Party, which had high hopes of entering the government, failed to meet the 4% threshold required to secure seats in the National Council. The far-right Freedom Party, on the other hand, saw a resurgence in popularity, particularly among voters disillusioned with traditional parties and the European Union. This result marks a shift in the political landscape of Austria, with the FPOe poised to wield considerable influence in the new government. Despite the challenges, the SPOe and OeVP have expressed a willingness to form a Grand Coalition once again. The two parties have a history of cooperation and have previously governed Austria together between 2005 and 2017. Chancellor-designate, Alexander Schallenberg of the OeVP, has stated that the parties have the ""responsibility to form a stable government that represents the will of the Austrian people."" Both the SPOe and the OeVP have acknowledged the importance of addressing the concerns of the FPOe's voters, particularly those who feel disconnected from the European Union. The Grand Coalition has indicated that it will focus on issues such as immigration, security, and economic growth in its efforts to form a coalition government. However, the return of the Grand Coalition raises questions about the role of the FPOe in Austrian politics. The party's presence in government has been a source of controversy in the past, with some European leaders expressing concerns over its Eurosceptic and nationalist views. The upcoming coalition negotiations are expected to be complex, as both the SPOe and OeVP will need to find a way to accommodate the FPOe's demands while addressing the concerns of their own voter base. In conclusion, the Austrian election has resulted in a complex political landscape, with the Grand Coalition set to return to power. The challenges facing the new government are significant, particularly in addressing the concerns of the FPOe's voters and the potential backlash from European leaders. The coming weeks and months will be crucial as the SPOe, OeVP, and FPOe engage in coalition negotiations and begin the process of forming a new government.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Coronavirus: Homebirths to restart with new safeguards,"In the new normal brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic, giving birth at home is set to resume in the Lothian region of Scotland with stringent safety measures in place. The arrangement, which was paused earlier in the year due to the health crisis, will now allow for home births under the careful supervision of midwives. The safety protocols have been designed to minimize the risk of infection for both the mother and the baby. One significant change is the limit of one birthing partner. This means that only one person will be allowed to be present during the labor and delivery, making it essential for expectant mothers to carefully consider who they would like to have with them. The need for a separate changing space is another essential safety measure. This area will be used specifically for the care and dressing of the newborn, ensuring that it remains a safe and germ-free environment. Midwives will also be following strict infection control procedures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), to minimize the transmission of the virus. Midwives will conduct a risk assessment for every woman before agreeing to a home birth. This assessment will consider various factors, including the mother's health, the baby's position, and the availability of emergency resources. Those deemed high-risk will be advised to give birth in a hospital setting, where they will have access to more extensive medical care. The Scottish Government has emphasized the importance of continuing home births, recognizing the benefits they can offer to mothers and their babies. Home births have been shown to result in fewer interventions, less use of pain relief, and a more positive birth experience overall. Additionally, they can help reduce the burden on hospitals during the pandemic, allowing them to focus on the care of those who require more intensive medical attention. However, the return of home births also comes with challenges. Midwives are currently working under increased pressure due to the pandemic, with many juggling home visits, hospital shifts, and administrative tasks. This can make it difficult to provide the level of care and attention that home births require. Furthermore, the restriction on birthing partners may cause distress for some mothers, who may feel more comfortable having their loved ones present during the birth process. Despite these challenges, the NHS Lothian Midwifery Service is committed to making the resumption of home births as safe and supportive as possible. They are working closely with families to ensure they are well-informed about the new procedures and offering alternative means of support, such as virtual visits or phone calls, for those who are unable to have a birthing partner present. As the world continues to adapt to the new reality of the Coronavirus pandemic, the resumption of home births in the Lothian region marks an important step forward in providing women with safe, supportive, and personalized care during childbirth.

Unions call for end to local authority pay freeze,"Unison, Unite, and the GMB have once again lodged their annual pay claim with local authorities, calling for an end to the current pay freeze and demanding a significant increase in wages. The trade unions argue that their members have been subjected to real-term pay cuts for far too long, and that it is time for local councils to acknowledge the value of their employees' contributions to the community. The unions have put forward a number of key demands, including the implementation of a ""living wage"" of Â£7.20 an hour. This figure represents the minimum hourly rate necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs, according to the Living Wage Foundation. The unions believe that local authority employees have been paid below this threshold for too long and that it is time for a change. In addition to the living wage, Unison, Unite, and the GMB have also asked for a Â£1,000 flat rate payment for workers. This payment would serve as a one-off boost to employees' wages, helping them to cover the cost of living expenses and offset the impact of the pay freeze. The unions are urging local authorities to consider these demands seriously, warning that failure to do so could result in industrial action. In recent years, there have been several high-profile strikes by council workers, including refuse collectors, care workers, and school support staff. These actions have caused significant disruption to local services and have put pressure on councils to engage in meaningful pay negotiations. The trade unions argue that their members deserve a fair deal, especially given the vital role they play in delivering essential services to the public. They point out that many council workers have seen their pay frozen for several years, while the cost of living has continued to rise. Local authorities have defended their pay policies, arguing that they are facing significant financial pressures and that any significant wage increases would put further strain on their budgets. However, the unions argue that councils have a moral duty to ensure that their employees are paid a fair wage, and that the long-term benefits of investing in the workforce outweigh the short-term costs. The pay dispute comes at a time when local authorities are grappling with a range of challenges, including funding cuts, rising demand for social care services, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their finances. However, the unions are determined to make their voices heard, and are urging local councils to engage in constructive negotiations to find a fair and equitable solution to the pay dispute. In the meantime, council workers across the country are waiting anxiously to hear the outcome of the pay negotiations. They are hopeful that their employers will recognise the value of their contributions and offer them a fair and decent wage, allowing them to focus on delivering essential services to their communities without the added stress of financial uncertainty.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Greece 'may need 10bn euros more' in aid - Stournaras,"Yannis Stournaras, the governor of the Bank of Greece, made some unexpected remarks during an interview with CNBC Europe, suggesting that Greece may need an additional 10 billion euros in financial aid. This comes as a surprise, as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) recently provided Greece with a 15-billion-euro bailout package, which was considered to be sufficient to address the country's financial woes. Stournaras, a respected economist and former finance minister, acknowledged that the previous bailout was ""much larger than what is needed"" but emphasized that ""if there is need for further support, it will be in the order of about 10bn euros."" He added that this amount would be ""much smaller than the previous one."" The governor's comments came amid growing concerns about the sustainability of Greece's debt burden, which stands at around 180% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have both urged Greece to implement deeper reforms to reduce its debt and restore investor confidence. Stournaras did not provide any specific details on what areas of the Greek economy would require additional support, but he did mention that the country's economic recovery was ""slow but steady."" He also expressed optimism that Greece would meet its fiscal targets for 2015, which include a primary budget surplus of 1.5% of GDP. The news of potential further aid for Greece was met with skepticism by some market participants, who questioned whether the country could realistically implement the reforms needed to justify additional financial support. Others argued that the European Union and the IMF would be reluctant to provide Greece with yet another bailout, given the political instability and public opposition to austerity measures in the country. Despite these concerns, Stournaras remained upbeat about Greece's prospects, stating that ""the Greek economy is recovering and will continue to recover."" He also expressed confidence that the country's reform program would ""bear fruit in the medium term,"" leading to a sustainable economic recovery and a reduction in its debt burden. In conclusion, Yannis Stournaras's comments about the need for additional financial aid for Greece have raised eyebrows in financial markets and among observers of the European debt crisis. While the governor's optimism about Greece's economic prospects is welcome, the feasibility of implementing the reforms necessary to justify further aid remains to be seen. The coming months will be critical in determining whether Greece can turn the corner and begin to regain the confidence of investors and the international community.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Crossing Divides: Do you live in a social bubble?,"We asked people in an international poll how they feel about their choice of friends, and the results were intriguing. Conducted among people with internet access across the globe, the survey aimed to understand the extent of social bubbles in today's interconnected world. The data revealed that a significant number of respondents reported having friends from diverse backgrounds, including different ethnicities, religions, and socio-economic statuses. However, a noteworthy proportion admitted to having a limited social circle, with friends who share similar beliefs, values, and experiences. As we delve deeper into the results, it becomes clear that social bubbles are not an uncommon phenomenon. In fact, they can form naturally, as people tend to be attracted to those who are similar to them. However, living in a social bubble can limit our exposure to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. It can also perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings, fueling social division and intolerance. So, how can we break free from our social bubbles and cross divides? One way is to actively seek out opportunities to engage with people from diverse backgrounds. This could be through joining social groups or volunteer organizations that bring together individuals from different walks of life, or simply striking up a conversation with someone new. Another way is to challenge our own biases and assumptions. This requires self-reflection and a willingness to listen to and learn from others. It also involves being open-minded and non-judgmental, even when faced with unfamiliar ideas or beliefs. But it's not just about individual actions. Societal structures and systems also play a role in perpetuating social divides. For example, segregated housing, unequal access to education and employment opportunities, and discriminatory policies can all contribute to social isolation and exclusion. Addressing these structural issues requires collective action and a commitment to social justice. This could involve advocating for policies that promote equality and inclusivity, supporting organizations that work to bridge divides, and engaging in dialogue with those who hold different views. So, do you live in a social bubble? Take our interactive quiz to find out and explore ways to cross divides and broaden your horizons. Remember, every interaction is an opportunity to learn, grow, and build a more connected and inclusive world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mayor considers Hoo peninsula in Kent as airport option,"Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, has been exploring various options to increase flight capacity around the capital city without expanding Heathrow, the country's busiest airport. He has also been considering building an airport in the Thames Estuary, with the Hoo Peninsula in Kent emerging as a potential contender. The Hoo Peninsula, located in the north-west corner of Kent, offers several advantages for an airport project. Its proximity to the Thames and the North Sea makes it an ideal location for a port-based airport. Furthermore, the peninsula is relatively undeveloped, providing ample space for runways and other airport infrastructure. Mr Johnson has previously expressed his support for a Thames Estuary airport, stating that it could create thousands of jobs and generate significant economic benefits for the London region. He has also emphasized the need to reduce airport-related noise and air pollution by building an airport further away from densely populated areas. The proposal to build an airport on the Hoo Peninsula has received mixed reactions from the public and stakeholders. Some local residents have expressed concerns about the potential impact on their communities, including increased traffic and noise. Others have welcomed the idea of new jobs and economic opportunities. Environmental groups have also raised concerns about the impact of an airport on the local ecosystem. The peninsula is home to several protected habitats, including the Medway Estuary and the Swale National Nature Reserve. The potential impact on these areas would need to be carefully assessed and mitigated, according to experts. Despite the challenges, Mayor Johnson remains committed to exploring the option of a Thames Estuary airport. He has appointed a team of experts to conduct a feasibility study and assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of different airport locations in the estuary. The study is expected to be completed by the end of the year. If the feasibility study proves positive, the next steps would involve securing funding and gaining the necessary approvals from local and national authorities. The project would likely face significant opposition from local residents and environmental groups, making it a complex and contentious undertaking. Regardless of the outcome, the debate around a Thames Estuary airport is an important one that raises broader questions about the role of aviation in London's future and the balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. As the Mayor continues to explore this option, he will need to engage in open and transparent dialogue with all stakeholders to build consensus and ensure that any airport development is done in a responsible and sustainable way.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: People 'have got the message' and stayed home,"The Welsh Government's decision to impose severe curbs on people's lives in response to the continuing surge of coronavirus cases has been met with a mixed reaction. After thousands of people clogged the streets of Cardiff and Swansea over the weekend, creating scenes reminiscent of the pre-pandemic era, the Welsh authorities had no choice but to take drastic measures. From Monday, people in Wales were required to stay at home, except for essential reasons such as work, education, or exercise. The new restrictions also included a ban on travel in and out of the country without a reasonable excuse. These measures, which mirror those seen in the first wave of the pandemic, have been met with a varying degree of compliance. For some, the threat of fines for disobeying the rules has been enough to keep them indoors. ""I don't want to risk getting a fine or worse, falling ill,"" said one resident of Cardiff. ""I think most people have got the message now, and they understand the importance of staying home."" However, not everyone is convinced that the new restrictions will be effective. ""I don't think these measures will make much difference,"" said another resident of Swansea. ""People have been ignoring the rules for months, and I don't think a few fines will change that."" The Welsh Government has defended its decision, stating that the new measures are necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to save lives. ""We understand that these restrictions will be difficult for many people, but we must do everything we can to reduce the spread of the virus,"" said Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething. The new restrictions come as cases of the Omicron variant continue to rise across the UK. The variant, which is believed to be more transmissible than previous strains, has already led to record-breaking daily case numbers in some areas. Despite the challenges, there are signs that people are starting to take the situation more seriously. ""I think people are starting to realise that this is not a joke,"" said one resident of Cardiff. ""We need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and each other."" As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether the new restrictions will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. In the meantime, people across Wales are being urged to follow the rules and to stay home as much as possible to help protect themselves and their communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bat virus clues to origins of Sars,"By Keeren Flora, BBC Radio Science Unit Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats, providing intriguing clues about the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars). These viruses, named Rhinolophus sinicus SARS-related coronavirus 1 and Rhinolophus sinicus SARS-related coronavirus 2, were identified through a collaborative study between researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of California, Davis. Critically, the viruses infect human cells in the same way that the Sars virus does, suggesting a potential link between these bat viruses and the 2002-2003 outbreak that infected over 8,000 people and caused almost 800 deaths. The team, led by Dr. Xing-Lou Yang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, discovered the viruses in respiratory and intestinal samples collected from horseshoe bats in Yunnan province, China. The findings, published in the journal Science, are significant because they provide the strongest evidence yet of a direct link between bats and the human Sars outbreak. Previous research had suggested that Sars may have originated in bats, but this was based on genetic analysis of the virus and its closest relatives. The new study provides the first direct evidence of Sars-like viruses in bats that can infect human cells. The researchers were able to isolate the viruses and study their characteristics in detail, including their ability to infect human cells and their genetic makeup. They found that both viruses were closely related to the Sars virus, but they were distinct enough to be considered separate viruses. The discovery of these viruses in Chinese horseshoe bats is not surprising, as these bats have previously been identified as potential reservoirs for Sars-like viruses. Chinese horseshoe bats, also known as Rhinolophus spp., are widely distributed throughout Asia and are common carriers of coronaviruses. However, the study does not provide definitive evidence of how the Sars virus jumped from bats to humans. The researchers suggest that further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of zoonotic transmission and to identify the specific intermediate host or hosts that facilitated the transfer of the virus from bats to humans. The findings also highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance for coronaviruses in animals, particularly in areas where humans come into close contact with wildlife. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations have emphasized the need for increased surveillance and preparedness to prevent future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. In conclusion, the discovery of two novel Sars-like coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats provides critical insights into the origins of the Sars outbreak.

Alex Salmond launches Â£103m renewable energy fund,"The Renewable Energy Investment Fund (REIF), announced by Alex Salmond, former First Minister of Scotland and current Co-Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), aims to attract more private investment to the renewable energy sector in Scotland. The fund, which stands at Â£103 million, is a significant step towards realising Scotland's ambitious goal of generating 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Speaking at the launch event in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond emphasised the potential for Scotland to lead the world in renewable energy innovation. He highlighted wave and tidal energy, and renewable district heating, as the priorities for the fund, stating, ""Scotland has the natural resources and the innovative talent to be at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution."" The REIF is a crucial component of the SNP's Green New Deal, a comprehensive plan to stimulate economic recovery and address climate change. The fund will provide grants, loans, and equity investments to renewable energy projects, with the potential to leverage additional private investment. Wave and tidal energy, which harness the power of the ocean, have long been identified as key areas of focus for Scotland. The country's coastline offers significant potential for generating renewable energy from the sea, with several companies, including Aquamarine Power and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, already developing wave and tidal energy technologies. The REIF is expected to accelerate the growth of this sector by providing funding for research and development, as well as commercial-scale projects. Renewable district heating, another priority for the fund, is a system that uses renewable energy sources to heat buildings and communities. This approach can significantly reduce carbon emissions, particularly in areas with high heating demand, such as densely populated urban areas. The Scottish Government has identified district heating as a key component of its strategy to decarbonise heat, and the REIF is expected to provide crucial financing for projects in this area. The launch of the REIF has been met with enthusiasm from the renewable energy industry and environmental organisations. Renewable Energy Scotland, the trade body for the sector, welcomed the announcement, stating, ""The Renewable Energy Investment Fund is a game-changer for the renewable energy sector in Scotland. It will help to attract much-needed private investment and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy."" The Scottish Greens also expressed their support for the fund, with co-convener Patrick Harvie stating, ""Scotland has the potential to lead the world in renewable energy, and the Renewable Energy Investment Fund is a vital step towards making that a reality. We need to see real action from the Scottish Government to ensure that this fund delivers the jobs, investment, and carbon reductions that Scotland needs.""

Twitter abuse and bomb threat claims probed by police,"The Metropolitan Police announced on Wednesday that its central e-crime unit would investigate a series of bomb threat claims and instances of Twitter abuse targeted at six individuals. Among those affected were four female journalists, a student, and a social media influencer. The first bomb threat was reportedly received by one of the journalists on Monday, with the others following suit over the next two days. The threats were made via direct messages on Twitter, each containing a countdown timer and a cryptic message indicating an imminent attack. The recipients, understandably shaken, immediately contacted the authorities and alerted their respective news organizations. The three bomb threats made outside London were also reported to the police, and all six individuals were advised to take precautions to ensure their safety. While the specifics of these threats have not been released, the Met stressed that the incidents were being taken very seriously and that a thorough investigation was underway. The issue of Twitter abuse, particularly against women in journalism, has been a growing concern in recent years. In response to these incidents, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) issued a statement expressing its ""grave concern"" and calling on Twitter to take more decisive action against such abuse. The union also urged journalists to report any incidents to both their employers and the police. Twitter has faced criticism in the past for its handling of abusive behavior on its platform. In 2017, the company introduced new rules designed to crack down on harassment and abuse, including the ability for users to report multiple tweets at once and the introduction of a ""hidden replies"" feature that allows users to hide abusive responses to their tweets. However, many argue that more needs to be done to address the issue. The issue of online harassment and bomb threats is not unique to the UK, and similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the world. In the US, for instance, journalists and politicians have been targeted with threats of violence and bombings, often via social media platforms. In response, many organizations and individuals have called for greater action to be taken against such behavior, both by social media companies and law enforcement agencies. As the investigation into these incidents continues, the Met is urging anyone with information to come forward and contact the police. In the meantime, the affected individuals and their employers have issued statements expressing their support and solidarity, reminding us all that freedom of speech and the ability to report the news without fear or intimidation are fundamental principles that must be protected.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Liberia warlord 'Jungle Jabbah' jailed for 30 years in the US,"Mohammed Jabbateh, also known as Jungle Jabbah, a notorious Liberian warlord, was found guilty of immigration fraud in a US court on Tuesday. The verdict came after a week-long trial during which the prosecution presented evidence that Jabbateh had lied to US authorities in the 1990s about his past involvement with armed groups in his native Liberia. One witness testified that Jabbateh had been a commander in the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Africa (ULIMO), a militia group that waged a brutal war in Liberia during the 1990s. The witness, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said that Jabbateh had led attacks on civilians and had ordered the execution of prisoners. The prosecution also presented documents and testimony from Liberian refugees who identified Jabbateh as a warlord they had fled from during the conflict. These refugees testified that Jabbateh had been responsible for the deaths of their family members and the destruction of their homes. Despite this evidence, Jabbateh maintained his innocence throughout the trial. He claimed that he had left Liberia in 1991, before the conflict began, and had lived in the United States ever since. However, the evidence presented by the prosecution contradicted this story, including records showing that Jabbateh had entered the US using a false name and a false date of birth. Jabbateh's defense team argued that their client had been misunderstood and that he had come to the US to seek asylum, not to commit immigration fraud. They also argued that the witnesses against Jabbateh were motivated by personal animosity and that their testimony was not credible. However, the jury did not buy these arguments. After just a few hours of deliberation, they returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on all counts. Jabbateh was immediately remanded into custody and faces up to 30 years in prison. The trial brought back painful memories for many Liberians, who lived through the horrors of the civil war in the 1990s. The conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 2003, claimed the lives of an estimated 250,000 people and displaced more than a million others. Many Liberians welcomed the verdict, seeing it as a small step towards justice for the victims of the war. However, others expressed concern that Jabbateh's conviction would not bring them any closure or compensation. They called on the US government to do more to help Liberian war crime suspects face justice, either by extraditing them to Liberia or by trying them in US courts. For his part, Jabbateh is likely to appeal the verdict, hoping to avoid the lengthy prison sentence that awaits him. But for the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pakistan rules out offensive against Punjab militants,"By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif, has ruled out an offensive against militants in the country's most populous province, Punjab, hours after raising concerns about their presence and activities there. Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Mr Asif said that the military would continue its ongoing counter-terrorism operations in other parts of the country, but there were no plans for a new offensive in Punjab. ""We are not planning any military operation in Punjab,"" he said, adding that the civilian government was in control of the situation in the province. His remarks came hours after he told a parliamentary committee that ""Punjabi Taliban"" were entrenched in southern parts of Punjab. Mr Asif said they were planning to launch attacks in other parts of the country and were also involved in sectarian violence. The defence minister's comments have fuelled speculation about a possible military operation in Punjab, which is home to the vast majority of Pakistan's 220 million people and is ruled by the powerful Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. Punjab has seen a rise in militant activity in recent years, with groups such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) carrying out attacks against security forces and minority communities. The military has carried out several operations in other parts of the country, including North Waziristan, Swat and South Waziristan, to root out militants and restore peace. But the military has been reluctant to launch a major operation in Punjab, fearing the political and social repercussions. The province is also home to several powerful military and intelligence agencies, which could complicate any military operation. Mr Asif's comments have, however, raised concerns about the security situation in Punjab and the government's ability to tackle the militant threat there. The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has demanded that the government take action against the militants in Punjab and accused the PML-N of shielding them. The PML-N, which is led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has denied the allegations and accused the PTI of trying to create a ""crisis situation"" for political gains. The military has also denied any plans for a military operation in Punjab, saying that the province's law and order situation was under the control of the civilian government. But the ongoing militant threat in Punjab and the increasing number of attacks against security forces and minority communities have raised concerns about the government's ability to maintain law and order in the province.

Tories and SNP clash over wind power support,"The YouGov poll suggests that a majority of supporters of every party, including Tories, express their approval for wind power. However, the contentious issue of wind farm development continues to spark controversy and division, particularly in Scotland where the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Conservative Party (Tories) find themselves at odds. The small but vocal anti-wind farm campaigners, who have long opposed the construction of new wind farms, arranged a protest outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh last week. Waving banners with slogans such as ""Wind Turbines: Industrializing our Countryside"" and ""Say No to Wind Farms,"" the protesters voiced their concerns over the environmental impact of wind energy and the potential harm to wildlife, particularly birds and bats. The SNP, currently the governing party in Scotland, has been a staunch supporter of renewable energy and wind power in particular. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set ambitious targets for increasing Scotland's reliance on renewable energy, with a goal of generating the equivalent of 100% of the country's electricity demand from renewable sources by 2020. However, the Tories, who are in opposition in Scotland, have criticized the SNP's approach to wind power, arguing that the focus on wind farms comes at the expense of other energy sources and the needs of rural communities. Scottish Conservative energy spokesperson Liam Kerr stated, ""The SNP's obsession with wind power is causing untold damage to rural communities across Scotland. It's time for the SNP to adapt and consider a more balanced energy policy that includes other forms of renewable energy and traditional sources."" The Tories have also voiced concerns over the potential financial impact of wind farm development on rural communities. The Scottish Government has been criticized for not doing enough to share the revenue generated from wind farms with local communities. In response, the SNP has announced plans to introduce a new community benefit fund, which will provide financial support to communities affected by wind farm developments. The clash between the Tories and SNP over wind power is likely to continue, with both parties digging in their heels and making their cases to their respective supporters. The issue is not only a matter of energy policy but also a question of principles and values, with each party representing different perspectives on the role of renewable energy in Scotland's future and the needs of rural communities. As the debate continues, it is essential that all sides engage in constructive dialogue and find a way to reconcile their differing views.

Havelock House: Residents welcome rejection of demolition plans,"The building, on lower Ormeau Road, was vacated in 2018 ahead of a UTV move to new offices on City Quays. London company Olympian Homes bought it in the same year, with plans to demolish the historic site and build a modern apartment complex. However, a recent decision by Belfast City Council has brought hope to the residents and preservationists who have been campaigning against the demolition. The news was met with jubilation by the community, many of whom have strong emotional connections to Havelock House. The building, which dates back to the late 19th century, has a rich history and has been an integral part of the Ormeau Road community for generations. ""I remember coming here as a child,"" said one resident, who asked to remain anonymous. ""My grandfather used to take me to the cinema here. It's a part of my history, and I'm glad to see it will be preserved for future generations."" The campaign to save Havelock House gained momentum last year, with local residents and preservationists launching a petition to save the building. They argued that the historical significance of the building and its role as a community hub outweighed any potential benefits from a modern development. Belfast City Council agreed, citing the building's importance to the city's history and cultural heritage. In a statement, the council said, ""The preservation of Havelock House is important not just for its historical significance but also for the contribution it makes to the cultural and community life of the Ormeau Road area."" Olympian Homes has yet to comment on the decision, but it is understood that they are exploring alternative development options for the site. Some residents have suggested that the building could be converted into apartments or offices while retaining its original character. The reprieve for Havelock House has been welcomed not just by local residents but also by preservationists and heritage groups. The Ulster Architectural Heritage Society described the decision as a ""victory for common sense and a recognition of the importance of our built heritage."" As the community celebrates this victory, it serves as a reminder of the value of our historic buildings and the role they play in shaping our communities and our history. It also highlights the importance of community engagement and activism in protecting our heritage for future generations. Despite the positive outcome, the fight to save Havelock House is not over yet. The building still needs significant investment to restore it to its former glory.

Dog's dinner: DNA clue to how dogs became our friends,"By Helen Briggs, BBC News Our canine companions developed the ability to digest starchy foods during the farming revolution thousands of years ago, according to new research. The discovery could help explain how dogs became such close friends to humans. Scientists have long suspected that the domestication of dogs was linked to our agricultural past. Farming brought humans and wolves closer together, and the wolves that were able to scavenge on our crops and livestock were more likely to thrive. Now, a team of researchers from the University of Lincoln, UK, has found evidence that this process left a lasting mark on dogs' genetics. They discovered a genetic mutation that enables dogs to produce an enzyme, amylase, in their saliva, which helps them break down starches. The mutation is rare in wolves but is common in dogs, suggesting that it occurred during the early stages of dog domestication. The researchers believe it gave dogs an evolutionary advantage, allowing them to make the most of the new food sources that became available as humans began to farm. ""Dogs are the only domestic animal that has this mutation in their saliva,"" said Dr Angela Perri, lead author of the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports. ""It's a clear sign of their adaptation to a starch-rich diet."" The finding builds on earlier research, which showed that dogs have a higher number of genes associated with starch digestion than wolves. But this is the first time that a specific mutation has been identified. The team also found that the mutation is present in all dog breeds, suggesting that it occurred early in their evolution, and that it has been maintained in their population ever since. ""This mutation is a molecular time capsule that captures the key moment when dogs and humans began to interact,"" said Dr Perri. ""It's a really nice example of how genetics can tell us about the history of our relationship with animals."" The researchers hope that their findings will shed new light on the early stages of dog domestication, and provide insights into how other animals have adapted to life alongside humans. ""Our study shows how important it is to consider the genetic impact of domestication and agriculture on the animals we keep as pets and livestock,"" said Dr Perri. ""It's a fascinating area of research, and there's still so much to discover."" The researchers plan to continue their investigation, studying the genomes of different dog breeds to understand the genetic changes that have occurred since their domestication. They also hope to explore the genetic basis of other traits that have made dogs such popular companions, such as their loyalty and their ability to read human emotions. ""Dogs have been our companions for thousands of years,"" said Dr Perri.

South East hospitals charged Â£1.5m for ambulance delays,"Patient handovers in South East hospitals have reportedly resulted in significant financial penalties for the National Health Service (NHS). According to recent reports, these hospitals have accumulated a debt of approximately Â£1.5 million due to delays in handing over patients from ambulances to hospital staff. Jonathan Fox, from the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, expressed concern over the issue, stating that these delays not only cause frustration for ambulance crews but also hinder their ability to respond to other emergencies. He expressed his belief that the 15-minute target for handovers, set by the NHS, should be upheld to ensure efficient use of resources and prompt response times. However, Rob Way, a spokesperson for NHS England in the South East, defended the situation, attributing the delays to the complexities of patient care. He stated that the NHS strives to prioritize patient safety above all else and that handovers may take longer when additional care is required. Despite this explanation, the financial implications of the delays are significant. Each extra minute beyond the 15-minute target results in a charge of Â£2.44, adding up to a substantial sum for hospitals that frequently experience such delays. To address this issue, some hospitals have implemented measures to streamline the handover process. For instance, they have established dedicated areas for handovers and have trained staff to complete the process efficiently. Others have implemented technology solutions, such as electronic patient records, to facilitate seamless communication between ambulance crews and hospital staff. However, some criticize these measures as mere stopgaps and argue for a more fundamental rethinking of the healthcare system. They advocate for increased funding for the NHS to improve capacity and reduce the pressure on hospitals to prioritize efficiency over patient care. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of balancing healthcare priorities, with the need for efficient resource use and effective patient care. While the financial implications of ambulance delays are clear, the ultimate goal must be to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients. In the meantime, ambulance crews continue to face the challenge of responding to emergencies while dealing with the consequences of delayed handovers. The NHS in the South East remains under pressure to find solutions to address this issue and improve the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fire-hit Harrington Junior School to be rebuilt on site,"Harrington Junior School, located in the heart of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, was reduced to ashes on 28 May, an unfortunate incident that began inadvertently during ongoing refurbishment works. No words can adequately convey the devastation felt by the school community when they witnessed their beloved establishment go up in flames. The scene that unfolded that fateful day was one of chaos and despair. Emergency services rushed to the scene, battling the inferno that engulfed the school buildings. Firefighters worked tirelessly to contain the blaze, but the extent of the damage was already evident. The historic red-brick school, which had stood proudly in the town for over half a century, was now a smouldering ruin. The cause of the fire was later determined to be an electrical fault in the temporary power supply that was in use during the refurbishment works. Despite the tragic circumstances, investigators were quick to reassure the public that there was no evidence of foul play. In the aftermath of the fire, the school community came together in an outpouring of support. Parents, teachers, and students gathered at the site, holding vigils and laying flowers in memory of the lost building. The local community rallied around the school, offering their support and pledging donations to help rebuild the school. The Derbyshire County Council, which oversees the running of Harrington Junior School, has since announced that the school will be rebuilt on the same site. In a statement, the council said: ""We are committed to rebuilding Harrington Junior School as soon as possible, and we will work closely with the school community to ensure that the new building is a fitting replacement for the one that was lost."" The design of the new school has not yet been finalised, but it is expected to be modern and sustainable, reflecting the needs of the 21st-century learner. The council has also promised that the new school will be built with the latest safety features to prevent a similar incident from happening again. In the meantime, the school community has been temporarily relocated to a nearby site while plans for the new school are finalised. It is a challenging time for all involved, but the spirit of the Harrington Junior School community remains undeterred. As the ashes of the old school continue to cool, the hope for a new beginning grows stronger. The fire may have destroyed the physical building, but it cannot extinguish the indomitable spirit of the Harrington Junior School community. Together, they will rebuild, stronger and more resilient than ever before.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague,"The former foreign secretary, William Hague, has issued a stark warning against the prospect of a new Brexit referendum, expressing his belief that such a move would be ""divisive and hate-filled."" In an interview with the BBC, Hague, who served as the UK's foreign secretary from 2014 to 2016, expressed his concerns about the potential consequences of a re-vote on the issue that has deeply polarized the country. Hague, who was a leading figure in the pro-European Conservative Party, acknowledged the legitimacy of the 2016 referendum result but cautioned against attempting to overturn it. ""We have had a democratic decision,"" he said. ""I don't believe it's healthy or wise for the country to be told that they were wrong to make that decision."" The former minister went on to describe the potential campaign as ""hate-filled,"" citing the heated and divisive rhetoric that characterized the Brexit debate during the 2016 referendum. ""I don't think we want to go through that again,"" he said, adding that the political and social divisions that emerged during the campaign have yet to fully heal. Hague also questioned the motivations behind a potential new referendum, suggesting that it could be an attempt to appease certain factions within the ruling Conservative Party. ""I think it's important for us to remember that the main purpose of politics is to govern the country and to make it a better place for people to live, not to indulge in endless debates about the past,"" he said. The former foreign secretary's warning comes as speculation about a new Brexit referendum grows louder, with some members of the Conservative Party calling for a re-vote in light of the ongoing negotiations with the European Union. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out the possibility of a new referendum, but has also expressed a desire to get a deal done and move on from the Brexit debate. Hague's intervention is significant because of his status as a respected elder statesman of the Conservative Party and a prominent figure in the pro-European wing of the party. His warning about the dangers of a divisive and hate-filled campaign is likely to resonate with many who are concerned about the potential consequences of revisiting the Brexit issue. The former foreign secretary's comments also serve as a reminder of the deeply polarized nature of the Brexit debate and the challenges that lie ahead for the UK as it seeks to navigate its new relationship with the European Union. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether the calls for a new referendum will gain traction or whether the country will move on from the Brexit debate and focus on other priorities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
MSPs back Scottish smacking ban proposals,"A bill lodged by Green MSP John Finnie received the backing of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, with 80 MSPs voting in favour and 29 against. The proposed legislation is designed to give children the same legal protection from assault as adults. The Children (Equal Protection From Assault) (Scotland) Bill aims to amend the current law, which currently distinguishes between assaults on adults and those on children under the age of six. Finnie's bill seeks to abolish the legal defence of ""justifiable assault"" for corporal punishment of children. The Scottish Government had previously indicated its support for the bill, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stating that ""it is time for Scotland to align its laws with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."" Finnie, who has campaigned on the issue for over a decade, welcomed the vote, stating that ""this is a historic moment for children's rights in Scotland."" He added that ""it is simply not acceptable that children in this country have less legal protection against assault than adults."" Opponents of the bill argued that it would criminalise parents for using reasonable force to discipline their children, and could lead to an overburdened legal system. However, supporters of the bill argued that it would not affect parents' ability to use reasonable force to manage their children's behaviour, and that it would send a clear message that children's bodies are not instruments for correction. The Scottish Human Rights Commission also backed the bill, stating that ""it is unacceptable that children in Scotland do not have the same legal protections against assault as adults. This bill will help to ensure that children's rights to physical integrity and protection from violence are recognised and upheld."" The bill now moves to the next stage of the legislative process, with further debate and amendments expected before a final vote is taken. If passed, the new law would come into effect on a date to be determined by the Scottish Government. The Scottish Parliament's decision to support the bill was hailed as a major step forward in children's rights in Scotland, and is expected to influence similar debates in other parts of the UK and beyond. Finnie's bill is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving children's rights and wellbeing in Scotland, including the recent introduction of a new statutory duty on local authorities to promote children's mental health and wellbeing. As the debate on the bill continues, it is clear that the issue of children's rights to protection from assault is one that resonates deeply with people across Scotland and beyond. The passage of this legislation is a testament to the enduring commitment of Scottish politicians to upholding the rights of children and ensuring that they grow up in a safe, nurturing and supportive environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Algerian army 'kills jihadist behind Herve Gourdel beheading',"Abdelmalek Gouri and two associates were shot dead late on Monday in the town of Isser, a statement from the Algerian Ministry of Defence confirmed. The trio were reportedly members of Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), a militant group that pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS) in mid-September. The announcement came a day after the Algerian army announced it had killed another key figure in the group, Amine Bouchelaghem, also known as Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, in the same region. Gouri, who was believed to be in his early 30s, was the group's leader and had claimed responsibility for the beheading of French mountaineer Herve Gourdel in August. The brutal execution had marked a new escalation in militant activity in Algeria, which has seen a resurgence of Islamist violence in recent years. The army's statement did not provide details on how Gouri and his associates were killed, but it said they were ""neutralised"" following an operation in the area. Gouri had recently appeared in a video released by Jund al-Khilafa, in which he urged Algerians to join the group and promised to ""shed blood"" in the name of jihad. He had also threatened to carry out attacks against French interests in Algeria in response to France's military intervention in neighbouring Mali. The Algerian government has been on high alert since the emergence of Jund al-Khilafa, which is believed to have links to IS and other militant groups in the region. The group has claimed responsibility for several attacks on security forces and civilians in recent months. The Algerian army has stepped up its operations against militants in the country, particularly in the northern region where Jund al-Khilafa is believed to be based. The army has also strengthened security measures at key installations and border crossings, and has urged citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The Algerian government has also sought to bolster its diplomatic efforts to counter the threat from militant groups. In recent weeks, Algerian officials have held talks with their counterparts in France, Mali, and other countries in the region to coordinate their responses to the militant threat. The killing of Gouri and his associates is likely to be seen as a significant blow to Jund al-Khilafa, which had been gaining momentum in recent months. However, it is unclear whether the group will be able to regroup and continue its militant activities, or whether it will be completely dismantled. The Algerian authorities have urged citizens to remain calm and to avoid spreading rumours or false information about the situation. They have also called",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Wage inequality lowest in Wales, says ONS figures","By Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent The highest paid 1% of Welsh workers earn on average Â£41.20 an hour, seven times the wage of the lowest paid, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Wales has the lowest wage inequality among the UK nations, with the gap between the top and bottom earners narrower than in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The ONS data shows that the average hourly earnings for the bottom 10% of workers in Wales was Â£5.80 an hour in 2020 - the lowest in the UK. In contrast, the top 10% of earners in Wales had an average hourly wage of Â£24.50 an hour. However, the gap between the two groups in Wales was smaller than in all other UK countries. The difference between the average hourly wages of the top 10% and bottom 10% in Wales was Â£18.70 an hour. In England, the gap was Â£19.20 an hour, in Scotland it was Â£19.70 an hour, and in Northern Ireland it was Â£19.90 an hour. The ONS also found that the gender pay gap in Wales was smaller than the UK average, with women earning on average 11.5% less than men. This was lower than the UK average of 13.9%. The Welsh Government welcomed the news, with Economy Minister Vaughan Gething saying: ""These figures show that Wales continues to have the lowest wage inequality of any UK nation, which is a reflection of the Welsh Government's commitment to fair work and tackling poverty. ""We have introduced a number of policies to help reduce the gender pay gap, including our commitment to legislate for mandatory gender pay reporting, and we will continue to work to ensure that everyone in Wales has the opportunity to earn a fair wage."" However, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) warned that there is still work to be done to tackle wage inequality in Wales. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""It's good news that Wales has the lowest wage inequality of any UK nation. But no one should be celebrating while millions of people are still being paid poverty wages. ""The Welsh Government must build on this progress by investing in decent jobs and increasing the minimum wage to a living wage of at least Â£10 an hour. Only then will we see a fairer and more equal Wales."" The ONS figures also show that the average hourly wage in Wales was Â£15.51 an hour, below the UK average of Â£16.37 an hour. However, the Welsh Government pointed out that the cost of living is generally lower in Wales than in other parts of the UK.

Birmingham voters reject elected mayor plan,"Birmingham was among 10 English cities voting in mayoral referendums on the same day as the local council elections. In a surprising turn of events, the results have shown that Birmingham voters have rejected the plan for an elected mayor. The proposal for an elected mayor was put forward by the Coalition Government in 2011, as part of a wider set of reforms for local government. The idea was to give cities more control over their own affairs and to create a more accountable and visible figurehead for the city. However, the campaign leading up to the referendum saw a strong opposition from various groups, including Labour Party members, who feared that an elected mayor would weaken the power of the local council. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, saw it as an opportunity to strengthen their hold on the city. Despite the intense campaigning, the results of the referendum showed a clear victory for those opposing the elected mayor plan. According to the latest figures, over 57% of voters in Birmingham rejected the plan, with a turnout of over 30%. The news has been met with jubilation from those who campaigned against the elected mayor plan. Labour Party leader, Jon Lansman, said, ""This is a clear rejection of the Coalition Government's attempts to impose an elected mayor on Birmingham. The people of this city have spoken, and they have made it clear that they do not want an elected mayor."" The Conservative Party, on the other hand, has expressed disappointment at the result. Birmingham Conservative Party Leader, Robert Alden, said, ""We are disappointed with the outcome of the referendum. We believe that an elected mayor would have provided much-needed leadership and accountability for the city. However, we respect the decision of the people."" The rejection of the elected mayor plan in Birmingham is a significant blow to the Coalition Government's push for elected mayors in English cities. So far, only six cities have adopted the system, with the latest being Salford in Greater Manchester. It is unclear what the future holds for Birmingham's local government structure. Some have suggested that the city could explore other forms of devolution, such as a city region deal or a metro mayor. However, for now, the focus will be on the local council elections and the formation of a new administration for the city. In the meantime, the rejection of the elected mayor plan has sent a clear message to the government that the people of Birmingham do not want to be dictated to when it comes to their local government structure. The battle for control of the city's affairs is far from over, and it will be interesting to see how the various political parties respond to this unexpected result.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Highest weekly deaths in Wales since pandemic began,"There were 467 deaths in the week ending 15 January, which is 13 more than the week before. This was the highest weekly total in Wales since the pandemic began in March 2020. The figure was also 78% higher than the five-year average for weekly deaths during the same period. The Welsh Government and Public Health Wales expressed their condolences to the families and friends of those who had lost loved ones. They attributed the rise in deaths to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the Omicron variant, which has been causing a surge in cases throughout the UK and beyond. The number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales had been declining since mid-December, but the recent rise is a cause for concern. Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said, ""We are particularly concerned about the increase in deaths, as it shows the pressure the NHS is under and the impact of the virus on our communities."" She urged people to get vaccinated and follow the guidelines to reduce the spread of the virus and protect themselves and others. ""Vaccines remain the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19. I would urge everyone who is eligible to get their booster jab as soon as they can,"" she said. The increase in deaths comes as Welsh hospitals continue to face pressure from the ongoing pandemic. According to the latest figures, there are over 1,500 people in hospital with Covid-19, and over 100 of them are in intensive care. The Welsh Government has announced additional measures to help hospitals cope with the surge in cases. This includes the deployment of military personnel to help with non-clinical tasks and the delay of some non-urgent procedures. The rise in deaths also comes as the UK Government is facing criticism over its handling of the pandemic. The Opposition parties have accused Boris Johnson's government of being too slow to act and not providing enough support to the NHS and other essential services. Meanwhile, the UK reported over 100,000 new Covid-19 cases and over 1,000 deaths on Monday, the highest daily totals since the pandemic began. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in the UK is also at a record high. The Welsh Government is urging people to continue following the guidelines to help reduce the spread of the virus and protect themselves and others. These include wearing face masks in indoor public places, avoiding large gatherings, and following social distancing rules. The government is also encouraging people to get vaccinated and boosted as soon as they can.

Belarus: Journalists covering protests stripped of accreditation,"Two journalists with the BBC's Russian service are among those affected by the Belarusian authorities' decision to strip accreditation from over 60 international journalists covering the ongoing protests in the country. In a statement, the BBC said it condemned ""in the strongest possible terms the Belarusian authorities' actions against accredited media, including the BBC."" The BBC journalists, who have not been identified for safety reasons, were covering the protests that erupted after the contested presidential election on August 9th. The authorities allege irregularities in the vote, while the opposition and their supporters claim that the election was rigged. The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) reported that the authorities have revoked accreditation for over 60 international journalists since the protests began. The BAJ described the move as an ""attack on press freedom"" and a ""violation of international standards."" The European Union and other international organizations have also condemned the decision. The BBC statement called on the Belarusian authorities to ""respect the fundamental principles of media freedom and allow journalists to report on events in Belarus without fear or hindrance."" The BBC also expressed concern for the safety of its journalists and other media workers in Belarus, urging the authorities to ensure their safety and protect their right to report on events in the country. The revocation of accreditation comes as the Belarusian authorities have stepped up their crackdown on protests and the opposition. Thousands have been arrested, and there have been reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees. The authorities have also cut off internet access in some areas, making it difficult for journalists to report on events in real-time. The BBC's Russian service has been covering the protests in Belarus extensively, providing regular updates on developments and interviews with protest leaders and activists. The service has also reported on the human rights situation in the country and the response of the international community. The BBC's statement echoes the concerns of other international media organizations and human rights groups. Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders have also condemned the revocation of accreditation and urged the Belarusian authorities to respect media freedom and allow journalists to report on events in the country without fear or hindrance. The Belarusian authorities have defended their actions, saying that they are necessary to maintain law and order and prevent the spread of false information. However, critics argue that the crackdown on the media is an attempt to suppress opposition voices and limit the flow of information to the Belarusian people. The situation in Belarus remains tense, with protests continuing in various cities across the country. The international community has called on the Belarusian authorities to respect the fundamental rights of their citizens and engage in a dialogue with the opposition.

Coronavirus: Over 300 patients refuse ambulance over Covid-19 fears,"Toby Lewis, chief executive of Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, said hospitals are now ""much clearer"" about how to manage the infection, but the refusal of ambulances by over 300 coronavirus patients poses a significant challenge. ""We are making progress in our understanding and response to COVID-19, but it is disheartening to see such a large number of patients refusing ambulance transport due to fear of contracting the virus,"" Lewis stated. According to data from the West Midlands Ambulance Service, approximately 300 patients have declined ambulance services between March and May despite having serious medical conditions that required urgent attention. The reasons behind their refusal vary, from concerns about being hospitalized and catching the virus to fear of the unknown. Lewis emphasized the importance of seeking medical help when needed, ""It's crucial that people understand the risks of delaying medical treatment. In many cases, not getting the help you need when you need it can lead to more serious health complications or even death."" He also acknowledged the validity of patients' concerns, ""We completely understand that people are scared, and it's our duty to assure them that we are taking every possible measure to keep them safe."" The NHS Trust has put in place extensive measures to protect patients from the virus, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for all staff, enhanced cleaning procedures, and the creation of COVID-19-free areas in hospitals. Despite these efforts, the Trust is still grappling with the issue of patient refusal, leading to a potential increase in demand for emergency services in the community. To address this issue, the Trust has launched an awareness campaign to educate the public about the importance of seeking medical help when needed and the safety measures in place to protect them from the virus. The campaign includes social media, local media, and community outreach efforts, as well as direct communication with patients who have previously declined ambulance services. Lewis urged anyone with concerns or questions to contact their GP or hospital directly, ""We want to reassure people that their health and safety is our top priority. If you have a medical condition that requires attention, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help."" The refusal of ambulance services by over 300 patients is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach.

Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision',"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, a dedicated and experienced paediatrician, found herself at the center of a medical and legal storm after a tragic incident that led to the death of a six-year-old boy named Jack Adcock. The incident occurred during her shift at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2011. The events that followed would result in her being struck off the Medical Register, a decision that was upheld in a recent Court of Appeal hearing. The incident began when Jack, who had a history of epilepsy, was admitted to the hospital with a suspected gastroenteritis infection. Dr Bawa-Garba and her team were caring for several other patients and were under significant pressure due to staff shortages. Despite this, Dr Bawa-Garba took the time to assess Jack's condition and ordered several tests, including a blood glucose level test, which came back normal. However, later that day, Jack's condition deteriorated rapidly. He became unresponsive and was later found to have a low potassium level, a common side effect of certain epilepsy medications. Despite this, Dr Bawa-Garba and her team did not recognize the signs of his deteriorating condition and failed to administer the appropriate treatment in a timely manner. Jack's condition continued to worsen, and he was eventually declared dead. Following Jack's death, Dr Bawa-Garba was suspended from her role at the hospital and was later charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. After a criminal trial in 2015, she was found guilty and was banned from practicing medicine in the UK. The decision to strike Dr Bawa-Garba off the Medical Register was not an easy one and was met with controversy and debate both within and outside of the medical community. Some argued that the pressures and demands of the NHS, particularly during periods of staff shortages, made it difficult for doctors to provide the best possible care to their patients at all times. Others argued that the criminal trial and subsequent removal from the Medical Register were too harsh a punishment for what they saw as honest mistakes made under difficult circumstances. The Court of Appeal, however, upheld the decision to strike Dr Bawa-Garba off the Medical Register, ruling that her mistakes had resulted in the death of a patient and that the public interest in patient safety required her removal from the profession. The judges also emphasized the importance of maintaining the high standards expected of medical professionals, particularly in cases where patient safety is at risk. Despite the controversy surrounding her case, Dr Bawa-Garba has expressed her remorse for her mistakes and her desire to learn from them. She has also called for greater support and resources for doctors and nurses working in the NHS, particularly during periods of staff shortages.

EasyJet hopes to reopen 75% of route network by August,"The airline industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with travel restrictions and lockdown measures bringing air travel to a near standstill. EasyJet, one of Europe's largest low-cost carriers, has been no exception to this trend. However, the airline is making steadfast efforts to rebuild its operations and restore as much of its route network as possible. EasyJet is already starting limited services this month, with the aim of reaching 75% of its pre-pandemic route network by August. This gradual return to service comes as the airline adjusts to the new normal in air travel. The health and safety of passengers and crew is now the top priority, with several measures put in place to mitigate the risk of transmission. Customers and cabin crew must wear face masks throughout the flight. EasyJet is providing masks to passengers who do not have their own, and the airline has also implemented temperature checks at airports and other measures to ensure a safe and hygienic travel experience. However, the in-flight experience will look quite different from what passengers were used to before the pandemic. No food will be served during the flights, with only pre-packaged snacks and drinks available for purchase. This is in line with other airlines' policies, as serving meals on planes increases the risk of transmission. EasyJet's CEO, Johan Lundgren, has said that the airline's focus is on ""rebuilding confidence in air travel"". With the gradual easing of travel restrictions in some parts of Europe, EasyJet is hoping to tap into the pent-up demand for travel. The airline's financial situation remains precarious, with the pandemic causing a significant drop in demand and revenue. EasyJet has raised Â£1.2 billion in new equity and debt financing to help it weather the storm. However, the airline is not alone in its struggles, with other airlines such as British Airways and Ryanair also facing similar challenges. The aviation industry as a whole is expected to take several years to recover from the pandemic. EasyJet's gradual return to service is a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen how long it will take for demand to fully return. In the meantime, the airline will continue to prioritize the health and safety of its passengers and crew, while also working to reduce costs and strengthen its financial position. EasyJet's recovery plan is not without challenges, but the airline is determined to bounce back. With a focus on safety, flexibility, and affordability, EasyJet is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the post-pandemic travel market. As restrictions ease and demand picks up, EasyJet hopes to once again take to the skies and connect people across Europe.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Why we need internet jokes and memes more than ever,"By Will Chalk, Newsbeat reporter But how closely are the two linked and what does that say about our mindsets, the internet, and our society?Yeah. We're tackling some big questions. And, while we're at it, we might as well add another: Why do we need internet jokes and memes more than ever? Let's start with the connection between humor and the internet. The web has made it easier than ever to access and share jokes and memes. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok have become breeding grounds for viral humor. But why is this form of humor so popular? One reason is that jokes and memes allow us to connect with each other in a lighthearted way. They can help us feel less alone in our thoughts and experiences. In a world that can feel increasingly divisive and isolating, humor provides a sense of community. Another reason is that jokes and memes are a way to process complex emotions and events. They can help us make sense of the world around us, and give us a way to express our thoughts and feelings in a relatable and often humorous way. But what about the more serious question: What does the prevalence of internet humor say about our mindsets, the internet, and our society? Some argue that the rise of internet humor is a sign of a culture that is increasingly cynical and detached. Others see it as a way to cope with the challenges and stresses of modern life. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, it's clear that internet humor is here to stay. And that's not a bad thing. In fact, it may be more important now than ever before. With the 24-hour news cycle and constant access to information, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and disconnected. Internet humor provides a welcome distraction, a way to laugh at the absurdities of life and find connection with others. Moreover, in a world that can feel increasingly divisive and polarized, internet humor can help bridge gaps and bring people together. It's a reminder that, despite our differences, we all share the human experience. So, the next time you come across a meme that makes you laugh, take a moment to appreciate the power of humor to connect us, to help us process complex emotions, and to provide a much-needed distraction from the challenges of the world. And who knows, you might even find yourself starting a new trend.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Belfast floods: Response to ordeal comes under fire,"Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy expressed his disappointment over the performance of Belfast's flood defenses during the recent flooding incident. Speaking to the media, Kennedy stated, ""The flood line did not perform as it should have, and I share the frustration and concern of those affected by the flooding."" The flood incident line, which is responsible for managing flood-related emergencies, is operated by the Department of Finance and Personnel, headed by Sammy Wilson. Mr. Wilson admitted that staff had been underprepared for the volume of calls received during the crisis. ""We understand the anger and frustration of those who have been affected by the flooding,"" Wilson said. ""Our staff have worked tirelessly to respond to the situation, but it is clear that we were not fully prepared for the scale of the incident."" Critics have been quick to question the government's response to the flooding, with some calling for a full investigation into the cause of the flood defenses' failure. Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy, who represents the constituency most affected by the flooding, urged the government to act swiftly. ""People's homes and livelihoods have been destroyed by this flooding, and it is essential that the government provides the necessary support to those affected,"" Murphy said. ""But it is also important that we get to the bottom of why the flood defenses failed and take action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future."" The Public Accounts Committee, which oversees the spending of public money, has announced that it will be holding an inquiry into the flood response. Committee chairperson Paula Bradshaw said, ""We will be examining the actions of all relevant departments and agencies, including the Department of Finance and Personnel, to establish what went wrong and what steps can be taken to prevent a recurrence of this situation in the future."" The flooding has also raised questions about the long-term investment in Belfast's flood defenses. The city has experienced several significant floods in recent years, and some have argued that more needs to be done to protect against future incidents. ""It's clear that we need to invest more in our flood defenses if we are to protect people and property from future incidents,"" Kennedy acknowledged.

Police inquiry over white-tailed eagle nest claim,"By David Miller, BBC Scotland environment correspondent Conservationists said it was the first nest made by white-tailed eagles in the east of Scotland in about 150 years. The sighting of the nest, high in a tree near the Firth of Forth, has been hailed as a significant milestone in the recovery of the once endangered species in Scotland. But the excitement has been tempered by concerns over alleged disturbance to the nest by individuals believed to be involved in bird of prey persecution. Police Scotland confirmed that an investigation was underway after receiving reports of potential disturbance. RSPB Scotland, which is leading the monitoring of the nest, said that a group of individuals were spotted near the site on 11th March. It is understood that they were in possession of a dog and may have disturbed the eagles. White-tailed eagles, also known as sea eagles, were once common in Scotland but were driven to the brink of extinction due to persecution. The last breeding pair in Scotland was recorded in the late 19th century. A reintroduction programme was launched in the late 1970s and the first successful breeding in the wild was recorded in 1993. The species has since made a strong comeback, with a population of around 400 pairs now living in Scotland. However, they remain a target for illegal persecution. Poisoning, shooting, and disturbance are the main threats to the birds. RSPB Scotland urged anyone with information about the incident to contact Police Scotland or Crimestoppers anonymously. ""This is a really significant nest and it's important that we do everything we can to protect it,"" said RSPB Scotland's head of investigations, Tolvera Wilson. ""We understand that there are people out there who still believe that it's acceptable to persecute birds of prey. But this is a crime that not only harms wildlife but also undermines the efforts of those working to protect and conserve them."" Police Scotland confirmed that they were taking the reports seriously and were working to identify those involved. ""We take reports of wildlife crime very seriously and we will work with partner agencies to investigate this matter fully,"" said a Police Scotland spokesperson. ""Anyone found to be involved in wildlife crime will be dealt with robustly through the courts."" The news of the investigation came as a blow to conservationists who had been celebrating the discovery of the nest. But they remain hopeful that the eagles will be able to raise their chicks undisturbed. ""This nest is a real symbol of hope for the future of white-tailed eagles in Scotland,"" said Tolvera Wilson. ""We are determined to do everything we can to protect it and ensure that these magnificent birds can continue to thrive in their natural habitat."" ",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Census 2020: US adds controversial citizenship question,"A dozen US states have launched legal actions against the Trump administration's decision to include a controversial citizenship question in the 2020 Census. The states, which include New York, California, and New Jersey, argue that the addition of the question will deter immigrants from participating in the census, potentially leading to an undercount of their populations. Trump administration officials, however, maintain that the data collected from the citizenship question will help the government allocate resources more effectively. The Department of Justice, which is spearheading the push for the question, has stated that the data is necessary to help the government enforce the Voting Rights Act and distribute funding for programs such as Medicaid and the National School Lunch Program. Critics of the move argue that the question could have a chilling effect on immigrant communities, many of whom are already wary of engaging with government officials. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other advocacy groups have warned that the question could lead to a significant undercount of the immigrant population, which could result in a loss of political power and federal funding for the affected communities. The controversy surrounding the citizenship question is not new. The Trump administration first announced its intention to add the question in March 2018, citing a need for accurate data on the number of non-citizens in the US. However, the decision was met with fierce opposition from civil rights groups, state governments, and even some Republican lawmakers. The issue came to a head in April 2019 when the US Census Bureau announced that it would begin printing the census forms without the citizenship question, following a ruling by the Supreme Court that the administration's justification for adding the question was ""contrived."" The administration has since indicated that it may explore other avenues for obtaining the data, such as executive orders or administrative rulings. The debate over the citizenship question is just the latest in a long line of controversies surrounding the census. The process of conducting a national census has been a contentious one since the country's founding, with concerns over privacy, accuracy, and the potential for political manipulation persisting throughout history. The 2020 Census is particularly important, as the data collected will be used to determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives and the allocation of billions of dollars in federal funding. The ongoing legal battle over the citizenship question is likely to continue well into the future, with implications for the political and demographic makeup of the United States for years to come. Despite the controversy, it is crucial that all Americans, regardless of their immigration status, participate in the census. An accurate count is essential for ensuring that resources are allocated fairly and that each community is represented in government. The Census Bureau has assured the public that their responses will be kept confidential and that the data will only be used for statistical purposes. The deadline to respond to the census online or by mail is October 3",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
No cause of death for Eric Garner after New York arrest,"Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was forcibly detained on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes on Thursday afternoon in Staten Island, New York. The incident, which was captured on video, has sparked outrage and calls for justice after Garner was heard repeatedly complaining that he couldn't breathe as officers held him down on the pavement. The disturbing footage shows Garner resisting arrest, with several officers attempting to subdue him. He can be heard uttering ""I can't breathe"" more than a dozen times before falling unconscious. Despite the efforts of bystanders and emergency responders, Garner was later pronounced dead at the scene. The medical examiner's office has yet to determine a cause of death for Garner. According to a spokesperson for the office, the autopsy results are still pending, and toxicology tests are being conducted to determine if any drugs or alcohol were a factor in his death. The NYPD has opened an internal investigation into the incident, and the officers involved have been placed on modified administrative duty. The Staten Island District Attorney's office is also conducting a separate criminal investigation. Garner's death has prompted protests and vigils in the Staten Island community and beyond. Civil rights activists and community leaders have called for justice, and some have called for the officers involved to be charged with a crime. The incident has also renewed calls for police reform and increased scrutiny of the NYPD's use of force policies. Garner's death comes just over a year after the death of Eric Harris, another Staten Island man who was placed in a chokehold by police. In that case, a grand jury declined to indict the officers involved. The Garner family has retained legal counsel and is calling for a thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. In a statement, the family said, ""Eric was a devoted father, partner, and friend. He worked hard every day to provide for his family. He did not deserve to die in this manner. We are committed to seeking justice for Eric and ensuring that those responsible for his death are held accountable."" The NYPD and the Staten Island District Attorney's office have both pledged to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into the incident. In a statement, District Attorney Daniel Donovan said, ""I understand the public's concern and the importance of a thorough, complete, and impartial investigation of this matter. I assure the public that I will conduct a comprehensive and transparent investigation into this matter, and that I will make all information available to the public as soon as it becomes available."" In the meantime, the community is left to grapple with the loss of yet another life at the hands of law enforcement, and to demand answers and accountability. The incident has once again raised questions about police use of force, racial bias in law enforcement, and the need for greater transparency",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Health regulator problems 'persist',"By Nick Triggle, Health correspondent, BBC News The Care Quality Commission (CQC) was only created in 2009 but has been under fire virtually ever since. The House of Commons' Health Select Committee said the regulator lacked the necessary powers to effectively hold the national health service (NHS) to account. Now, a damning report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has added to the criticism, suggesting the CQC had failed to learn from past mistakes and was still struggling to meet its objectives. The NAO report found the CQC had missed key signs of poor care at Wigan Infirmary, where babies were being born with avoidable injuries. It also highlighted concerns about the regulator's inspection regime and its ability to challenge the NHS effectively. The CQC has defended its record, saying it had made significant improvements in recent years. But the NAO report comes at a sensitive time for the regulator. It is currently carrying out a major overhaul of its inspection processes following a series of high-profile failures. The CQC is not alone in facing criticism. The Care Quality Commission for Wales (CQCW) has also been under scrutiny following concerns about the quality of care provided at the Denbighshire Mental Health Unit. The problems facing health regulators in England and Wales are not new. The Health Select Committee's report in 2013 called for a major overhaul of the regulatory system. But despite some changes, many of the same issues persist. The NAO report calls for greater transparency and accountability from the CQC, as well as more resources and clearer objectives. It also suggests the regulator needs to be more proactive in identifying and addressing poor care. The government has promised to address the issues raised in the report, including increasing the CQC's budget and giving it more powers to tackle poor care. But critics say these measures are long overdue and that more radical reform is needed. The CQC's failure to effectively regulate the NHS is not only a matter of principle. It also has serious consequences for patients. The lack of transparency and accountability means that poor care can go unchallenged, leaving vulnerable people at risk. The NAO report is a stark reminder that the CQC still has a long way to go if it is to fulfill its role as the guardian of quality in the NHS. And with the CQC facing similar challenges in Wales, the issue is not confined to one country. The health regulators in England and Wales are at a crossroads. They must learn from the past and take bold action to address the issues that have dogged them for years. The alternative is a health system that is not held to account, with patients paying the price.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Royal Cornwall Hospital 'neglected' woman who died in A&E,"Katy Lowry, a 30-year-old woman with chromosomal abnormalities and learning difficulties, arrived at Royal Cornwall Hospital on a cold winter evening on 13 December 2016. Her family had been desperately trying to get medical help for her all day as she had been vomiting uncontrollably at home. They were concerned, knowing that her health vulnerabilities could lead to serious complications if not addressed promptly. Upon arrival at the hospital, Katy was assessed by the triage nurse, who noted her symptoms and categorized her as a priority three case. This meant that she would have to wait before being seen by a doctor or nurse. Her family was informed of the wait time and urged to keep Katy comfortable in the A&E waiting area. Despite their best efforts to keep Katy calm and distracted, her condition continued to deteriorate. Her vomiting became more frequent, and she grew increasingly agitated and distressed. Hours passed, and still, there was no sign of a doctor or nurse coming to assess her. Her family grew increasingly worried and begged the hospital staff for help. As the hours ticked by, Katy's condition continued to decline. Her breathing became shallow, and her pulse grew weak. Her family watched in terror as the woman they loved slipped away in front of their eyes. Eventually, after more than 12 hours of waiting, a doctor finally came to examine Katy. But it was too late. She had gone into cardiac arrest and could not be revived. The news of Katy's death shocked and devastated her family. They could not understand how this could have happened. Katy had been a patient at the hospital before, and they had always received good care. But on this fateful day, something had gone horribly wrong. An investigation into Katy's death was launched by the hospital trust, and it was revealed that there had been several failures in her care. The triage nurse had failed to recognize the severity of Katy's condition, and there had been a delay in getting her a bed on a ward. The doctor who eventually saw her had also missed vital signs that could have indicated her deteriorating condition. The hospital trust expressed its deepest sympathies to Katy's family and acknowledged that mistakes had been made. They vowed to learn from this tragedy and make changes to ensure that such an incident would never happen again. But for Katy's family, the damage was already done. They were left to grieve the loss of a loved one, wondering what could have been if only she had received the care she needed when she needed it most.

Brexit: France warns UK of bitter trade negotiations,"French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian issued a stark warning to the United Kingdom on Monday, predicting that Brexit trade negotiations between the European Union and the UK would be bitter and difficult. Speaking during a visit to Bulgaria, Le Drian expressed his belief that both sides would ""rip each other apart"" as they strove for advantage in the talks. Le Drian acknowledged that the UK's aim of securing a free trade agreement with the EU was a complex one, but he cautioned that the EU would not be inclined to make significant concessions to the UK. ""It will be tough for the UK to achieve its aim,"" he said. ""The EU is a union, and we have red lines that we cannot cross."" The French minister's comments came as the EU and the UK entered the final stages of their negotiating process, with both sides expressing optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the year. However, significant hurdles remain, particularly on issues related to fisheries, the level playing field, and the governance of the agreement. Le Drian's warning was echoed by other EU officials, who have expressed frustration at what they see as the UK's unrealistic demands and its refusal to compromise. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has also warned that the EU would not be bullied into making concessions. The UK's Chief Negotiator, David Frost, has insisted that the UK will not be ""a vassal state"" of the EU and that the UK will not be bound by EU rules. Frost has also indicated that the UK is prepared to walk away from the negotiating table if a deal cannot be reached. The stakes are high for both sides. A no-deal Brexit would mean significant disruption to trade flows and could have far-reaching economic and political consequences. The EU and the UK are each other's largest trading partners, and a successful trade deal would be a major coup for both sides. Le Drian's warning underscores the challenges that lie ahead in the negotiations. Both sides are digging in their heels, and it remains to be seen whether they can find a way to bridge their differences and reach a deal. The coming weeks and months are likely to be a rollercoaster ride for Brexit watchers, as the two sides navigate the complex and often contentious negotiations. Despite the challenges, there is still hope that a deal can be reached. Both sides have expressed a desire to avoid a no-deal Brexit, and there is a shared recognition that a successful trade agreement would be in the best interests of both sides. The coming weeks and months will be critical in determining whether that goal is achievable. For now, the focus is on the negotiations, and both sides are gearing up for a final push to secure the best possible deal.

Shakespeare's skull 'probably stolen' from Stratford grave,"The discovery gives credence to a news report in 1879, later dismissed as fiction, that trophy hunters took the skull of William Shakespeare from his shallow grave in Stratford-upon-Avon over two centuries ago. A team of archaeologists and historians, using modern technology, has uncovered compelling evidence that suggests the Bard's skull may indeed have been stolen. A team from the University of Warwick and the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust used a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) scan to look through the floor of Holy Trinity Church, where Shakespeare is buried. The GPR scan revealed an unusual anomaly in the shape of a human skull in the area of Shakespeare's grave. The findings have sent shockwaves through the academic community and ignited renewed interest in the long-standing rumor. The 1879 report claimed that Shakespeare's skull was stolen by grave robbers who sold it to a doctor named William Smith for Â£5. Smith, it was said, kept the skull in his possession until his death in 1827, after which it was passed down through the generations of his family. The latest discovery has fueled speculation that the skull, which was last seen in the late 19th century, might be lying in a private collection or museum, waiting to be identified. ""This is a significant development in our understanding of Shakespeare's final resting place,"" said Professor Caroline Archer, of the University of Warwick's Department of Classics and Ancient History. ""The GPR scan provides strong evidence that there is an anomaly in the shape of a human skull in the area of Shakespeare's grave. This is consistent with the reports of the 1879 theft."" The news of the discovery has sparked a flurry of activity among researchers, who are now working to narrow down the possibilities of where Shakespeare's skull might be. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust has launched an appeal for information, asking anyone with knowledge of the whereabouts of the skull to come forward. ""We are taking this seriously and are working with the police and other experts to investigate this matter further,"" said a spokesperson for the Trust. ""We are determined to uncover the truth about what happened to Shakespeare's skull and to ensure that it is returned to its rightful place in Holy Trinity Church."" The discovery has also raised questions about the security of Shakespeare's grave and the broader issue of grave robbing in historic sites. Holy Trinity Church has been the subject of numerous thefts over the centuries, and Shakespeare's grave is no exception. ""This is a reminder of the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and protecting historic sites from grave robbers and other forms of vandalism,"" said Professor Archer. ""We need to take steps to ensure that the final resting places of our greatest historical figures are respected and protected.""

Edinburgh trams: Leith Walk may be hit by 18 months of disruption,"The closure of three lanes on Leith Walk would begin when construction on the Â£165.2m Edinburgh Trams extension project, if approved, gets under way in 2019. A business case details extending the line by 2.8 miles (4.6km) from York Place to Newhaven and Ocean Terminal. This ambitious expansion would see the trams traverse Leith Walk, a busy and popular thoroughfare in the heart of Edinburgh. For business owners and residents along Leith Walk, the prospect of 18 months of disruption is a cause for concern. The road is a major artery for the area, and the loss of three lanes could lead to significant traffic congestion. The Scottish Government, Transport Scotland, and Edinburgh Trams have promised to mitigate the impact of the construction works on local businesses. However, some traders fear that the loss of custom could be detrimental. ""We've already seen a drop in footfall since the announcement of the tram extension,"" said one shopkeeper. ""Customers are worried about getting to our stores, and we can't afford to lose any more business."" Others have expressed their frustration with the lack of clear communication from the authorities regarding the precise timeline of the construction works. ""We have been given no definitive answers about when the disruption will start and end,"" said another business owner. ""We need certainty to plan for the future."" The Edinburgh Trams team acknowledges the concerns and has promised to engage with the local community regularly to keep them informed. ""We will work closely with businesses and residents to minimise the impact of the construction works as much as possible,"" said a spokesperson for Edinburgh Trams. The extension project, which is being funded by the Scottish Government, aims to boost the economy by creating new jobs and attracting more visitors to the area. The proposed route will serve Newhaven Harbour, Ocean Terminal and the Royal Portobello area, making it easier for tourists and residents to explore these attractions. The proposed plans include the installation of a new tram depot at Newhaven Harbour, which will create new jobs and provide a vital maintenance base for the tram fleet. The extension is also expected to improve connectivity between Leith and the city centre, making it easier for people to travel between these areas. Despite the promises of economic benefits, some are sceptical about the impact on Leith Walk. ""We have seen this before with other infrastructure projects,"" said one resident. ""The initial disruption is always followed by long-term benefits, but it's a tough sell when businesses are struggling to survive."" The Scottish Government and Edinburgh Trams are expected to make a final decision on the project in the coming months. If approved, construction works could begin as early as 2019, with disruption expected to last for 18 months.

US warned Sri Lanka about Iran - wikileaks,"The revelations published by the Telegraph newspaper in London on Tuesday shed new light on the complex geopolitical relationships involving Sri Lanka, the United States, and Iran. According to the reports, the US Embassy in Colombo had expressed its concerns to the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, and the then Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, G.L. Peiris, regarding the possibility of Iranian oil tankers visiting Sri Lankan ports. The documents, obtained by WikiLeaks, date back to 2010, a time when international sanctions against Iran were tightening, and the US was putting pressure on countries to avoid doing business with Tehran. The cables reveal that the US Embassy in Colombo had been monitoring the situation closely and had warned Colombo about the potential risks of allowing Iranian ships to call at Sri Lankan ports. The embassy's concerns were not only about the potential diplomatic fallout from such a move but also about the financial and economic implications. The documents indicate that the US had warned that any Iranian tanker visiting a Sri Lankan port could face seizure by other countries, leading to significant financial losses for the Sri Lankan government and the port authority. However, the Sri Lankan government, which was facing a severe economic crisis at the time, was not deterred. In response to the US warnings, the then-Minister of Ports and Shipping, Mahinda Samarasinghe, reportedly assured the US Embassy that there were no plans to allow Iranian tankers to call at Sri Lankan ports. Despite this assurance, the documents suggest that there were ongoing discussions between Sri Lankan officials and Iranian representatives regarding the possibility of Iranian oil being supplied to Sri Lanka. The US Embassy also noted that there were reports of Iranian cargo ships visiting Sri Lankan ports, although it is unclear whether these were oil tankers. The revelations come at a time when Sri Lanka is once again in the international spotlight, this time due to its economic crisis and the ongoing political unrest. The country is currently in the midst of a severe economic downturn, with high inflation, unemployment, and a shortage of essential goods. The government, which is led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has been criticized for its handling of the crisis and its perceived authoritarianism. The US-Sri Lanka relationship has been complex over the years, with the US providing significant aid to the country following the end of the civil war in 2009. However, there have also been tensions between the two countries, particularly regarding human rights issues and the role of China in Sri Lanka.

There's now a word for nails on a blackboard - but it's not in English,"By Sarah Tijou, Newsbeat reporter It's a word to describe the feeling we get when we hear the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard, but it's not in English. This universal irritant has sparked curiosity among linguists and language enthusiasts, leading to the discovery of a word in another language that perfectly captures this sensation. The word is ""misophonia"" and it comes from the Greek words ""miso"" meaning hate and ""phonia"" meaning sound. Misophonia is a condition, not just a word, and it affects people in different ways. Sufferers experience an intense emotional response, often anger or anxiety, when exposed to specific sounds, such as chewing, breathing, or tapping. But back to the word. Misophonia might not be in English, but it has gained popularity in the English-speaking world thanks to the internet and social media. The term was first coined in 2001 by a team of American scientists who were studying the condition. However, it wasn't until 2013 that the word was officially added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The word ""misophonia"" is not the only one that doesn't have an English equivalent. There are many other words that beautifully capture emotions and sensations that don't have a direct translation in English. For instance, the Japanese word ""tsundoku"" refers to the act of buying and collecting books but not reading them. The Dutch term ""gezellig"" describes a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, and the Finnish word ""sauna"" is not just a place to relax and sweat but a deeply ingrained part of Finnish culture. These words remind us of the richness and diversity of language and the importance of preserving and celebrating the unique ways in which different cultures express their thoughts and emotions. So, the next time you cringe at the sound of nails on a chalkboard, remember that there's a word for it - misophonia. And if you ever find yourself in need of a word to describe the feeling of contentment you get from a warm, cozy fireplace, remember ""gezellig"" or ""sauna."" Language is a powerful tool that connects us to each other and to the world around us. And with words like these, we can articulate even the most elusive emotions and sensations, bringing us closer to understanding ourselves and the world around us.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

He sold an estimated 140 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His most successful album, ""Let's Dance,"" sold over 9 million copies alone. Bowie was also known for his innovative use of technology in the studio. He was one of the first artists to experiment with digital recording and synthesizers in the late 1970s. He continued to embrace new technology throughout his career, incorporating it into his music in groundbreaking ways. Despite his enormous success, Bowie remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He continued to write, record, and perform until his passing on January 10, 2016. Just days before his death, he released his 25th and final studio album, ""Blackstar,"" which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and received critical acclaim.

"Wrexham custody conditions criticised, amid praise","A report published by HM Inspectorate of Prisons has criticised the conditions at Wrexham custody suite in North Wales, raising concerns over inadequate access to healthcare and poor cleanliness. The watchdog's team inspected the facility in March 2022 and identified several areas of concern. The custody suite was described as ""dark and dirty"" with ""poorly maintained"" cells, and ""Maintenance issues were evident throughout the establishment."" The report stated that one cell had a broken window which had been taped up with duct tape, while another had a faulty light bulb which had been replaced with a makeshift solution of wires and a bulb. One of the most significant concerns identified by the inspectorate was the inadequate access to healthcare for detainees. The report states that ""healthcare was not always accessible when required"" and that there were ""long waits for healthcare appointments."" The inspectorate also noted that there was a lack of privacy during healthcare consultations, with detainees being assessed in the presence of other detainees. The custody suite was also criticised for its lack of cleanliness. The inspectorate found that there was a ""lack of regular cleaning in some areas"" and that there was ""evidence of mould and water damage in cells."" The report also highlighted that there were ""inadequate provisions for detainees to maintain personal hygiene."" Despite these criticisms, the report also praised some aspects of Wrexham custody suite. The inspectorate acknowledged that staff were ""generally courteous and respectful to detainees"" and that there was a ""good relationship between staff and detainees."" The report also noted that there were ""positive interactions between detainees and staff"" and that detainees were offered activities to help pass the time. The Welsh Government has responded to the report by stating that they are ""working closely with North Wales Police to address the issues identified by HM Inspectorate of Prisons."" A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said ""We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report and have already started work to address some of the issues identified. We are committed to ensuring that detainees are treated with dignity and respect, and that they have access to the support they need."" The Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales, Arfon Jones, has also responded to the report, stating that ""I am committed to working with the police and other partners to ensure that the custody suite is a place where people are treated with dignity and respect."" He added that ""I will be closely monitoring progress to address the issues identified in the report.""

Met office says 2016 'very likely' to be warmest on record,"By Matt McGrath, Environment correspondent This year has already been provisionally declared the warmest on record thanks to a combination of global warming and a strong El Nino. The Met Office believes, however, that 2016 could yet surpass the current record, making it the warmest year since temperature records began. The Met Office's provisional analysis of global temperatures for the first 11 months of 2016 indicates that the global average temperature during this period was 0.13 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous record set in 2014. But with December still to come, and temperatures typically higher at the end of the year, the Met Office says that there is still a good chance that 2016 will top the temperature charts. ""We've had a very warm year,"" said Dr. Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the Met Office. ""The odds are very much in favour of it being the warmest year on record."" The record-breaking temperatures have been driven by a combination of natural and human-induced factors. The El Nino weather pattern, which warms the Pacific Ocean and can lead to global temperature fluctuations, has been particularly strong this year. But even without El Nino, global temperatures would still be breaking records due to the long-term trend of global warming, according to Dr. Scaife. ""We're seeing more and more records being broken,"" he said. ""This is a clear signal of the long-term trend towards warmer temperatures."" The consequences of this warming trend are far-reaching and potentially dangerous. Melting ice caps and glaciers are leading to rising sea levels, while warmer temperatures are making some areas more prone to drought and extreme weather events. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that the current trend of warming is on track to take global temperatures to levels not seen for at least 115,000 years. ""We are now seeing the consequences of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" said WMO Secretary-General, Prof. Petteri Taalas. ""Future generations will inherit a much more dangerous world than the one we have today."" The Met Office and the WMO are calling on governments to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the worst impacts of climate change. ""We need to take action now to limit the warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,"" said Dr. Scaife. ""Otherwise, we risk causing irreversible damage to the planet."" The Paris Agreement, signed by 195 countries in December 2015, sets a goal of keeping the global temperature rise this century to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Blood test 'detects cancer relapse',"By James Gallagher, Health editor, BBC News website Scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London have developed a new blood test that can detect breast cancer relapse up to eight months before doctors would, through conventional methods. The researchers say their test could potentially save lives by allowing earlier intervention. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, involved testing blood samples from 349 women with early-stage breast cancer. All the women were cancer-free after their initial treatment, but 82 later experienced a relapse. The researchers used a technique called proteomics to measure the levels of proteins in the blood. They identified a set of 10 proteins that could distinguish those who were cancer-free from those who had a relapse. Dr Martha Gallagher, one of the lead authors, said: ""The fact we can detect signs of relapse before clinical symptoms appear is really exciting. It's a significant development in our quest to find new ways to improve outcomes for breast cancer patients."" Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, added: ""This test could potentially be used to identify women who are at high risk of relapse and allow them to receive targeted treatments before the cancer spreads further."" But the researchers warn that the test is not yet ready for use in clinical practice. They say more research is needed to validate the findings and to develop a version of the test that can be used routinely in hospitals. Dr Gallagher said: ""We need to carry out further studies to confirm the accuracy and specificity of the test. And we need to figure out the best way to implement it into clinical practice."" The researchers are now planning a larger study to test the blood test on a larger number of women, including those with other types of cancer. They hope that the test could eventually be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments and to identify those who are not responding well. Professor Charles Swanton, who was not involved in the study, but is a cancer expert at University College London, said: ""This is an important step forward in the development of liquid biopsy tests for cancer. It shows that it is possible to detect signs of cancer relapse in the blood before clinical symptoms appear."" But he also stressed the need for further research to validate the findings and to determine the best way to use the test in clinical practice. The researchers received funding from Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now, and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research programme. Professor Iain Foulkes, director of research at Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study is a great example of how research can help us to detect cancer earlier and more effectively. But we still need to invest in research to turn promising findings into clinical realities."" The researchers hope that their work will pave the way for the development of blood tests that can detect a",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Extra Â£40m for green spaces in England, Boris Johnson pledges","By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The government has pledged an extra Â£40m for green spaces in England, with Boris Johnson promising the creation of new national parks and thousands of jobs in conservation. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, the prime minister said the funding would help protect and enhance natural habitats, and create new opportunities for people to enjoy the outdoors. ""We will create new national parks, and new green spaces in our towns and cities,"" he told delegates. ""And we will create thousands of jobs in conservation."" Johnson said the investment was part of a broader commitment to protect the environment and tackle the climate crisis. He also promised to plant millions more trees, and to speed up the roll-out of electric vehicles. The government's Â£40m green spaces fund is on top of Â£1.6bn already pledged to protect and enhance nature, including Â£400m for tree planting and Â£2.5bn for restoring peatlands. Environment groups welcomed the funding announcement, but urged the government to follow through with its promises. ""The prime minister's commitment to create new national parks and protect natural habitats is a step in the right direction,"" said Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts. ""But to make a real difference, we need to see this funding translated into action on the ground. And we need to see a genuine commitment to tackling the root causes of nature's decline, such as intensive farming, over-extraction of resources, and the loss of green spaces in our towns and cities."" The Wildlife Trusts and other environmental groups have long called for greater investment in nature, arguing that it is essential for both people and the planet. They say that the benefits of a healthy natural environment include cleaner air and water, improved mental and physical health, and increased productivity. But they also warn that the challenges facing nature are immense, and that more needs to be done to address the root causes of its decline. These include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Johnson's pledge to create new national parks and green spaces is likely to be popular with the public, who value the natural environment highly. But it remains to be seen how much of the funding will be spent on practical conservation measures, and how much will be used for marketing and promotion. The prime minister's announcement comes at a critical time for the natural world, with the climate crisis and biodiversity loss threatening the survival of many species and ecosystems. It also comes as the UK hosts the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, which is expected to attract world leaders and climate activists from around the world. Johnson has made no secret of his ambition to be a global leader on environmental issues, and his pledge to create new national parks and green spaces is a sign that he is taking the issue seriously.

Anna Sorokin: Fake heiress released from US prison,"Anna Sorokin, who pretended to be a wealthy socialite named Anna Delvey, was released from prison on Thursday, according to US media reports. She served nearly four years of a fourteen-year sentence for grand larceny and theft of services. The Russian-born Sorokin, who came to the United States when she was eighteen, had managed to deceive New York's social elite and financial institutions with her elaborate charade. Sorokin first gained notoriety in 2017 when she was arrested and accused of defrauding banks and hotels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. She had presented herself as a German heiress with a net worth of $67 million, using fake documents and a convincing accent to support her false identity. Sorokin's deception began to unravel when she was unable to pay for a $60,000 art exhibition she had promised to fund at a Manhattan gallery. The case against Sorokin was built on a mountain of evidence, including emails, text messages, and testimony from those she had defrauded. Prosecutors alleged that she had created a web of lies, using her false identity to secure luxury accommodations, private jet flights, and other expensive perks. Sorokin's victims included banks, art galleries, and even a luxury hotel in the Hamptons. Despite the mounting evidence against her, Sorokin maintained her innocence throughout the trial. Her defense attorney argued that her client's actions were those of a naive and ambitious young woman who had gotten in over her head, rather than a criminal mastermind. The jury ultimately rejected this argument, finding Sorokin guilty on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. Sorokin's release from prison comes after she served around 41 months of her fourteen-year sentence. It is unclear what plans she has for the future, but she is reportedly being released to the care of a relative in California. The circumstances of her release, including whether she will be subject to any additional conditions or restrictions, have not been disclosed. The Anna Sorokin case captured the public's imagination due to its intriguing blend of deception, wealth, and celebrity. The saga of the fake heiress serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of living beyond one's means and the importance of truth and honesty in personal and professional relationships. With her release from prison, Anna Sorokin's story is far from over, and it will be interesting to see how she navigates her newfound freedom and what the future holds for this enigmatic figure.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Top universities in Russell Group fees review protest,"By Sean Coughlan, BBC News education correspondent They are angry that the Russell Group, which represents 24 leading universities in the UK, is refusing to reduce tuition fees in line with the inflating cost of living. Students from these institutions have been protesting over the past week, voicing their concerns about the financial burden of higher education. The Russell Group argues that their universities offer world-class education and that the current tuition fees, which stand at Â£9,250 per year, are necessary to sustain the quality of teaching and research. However, students argue that these fees are unsustainable for many, especially those from low-income backgrounds. The protests, which have taken place at universities across the country, have seen students gathering in large numbers to rally against the perceived lack of affordability and accessibility in higher education. Some have taken to social media, using the hashtag #FeeRegulationNow to draw attention to their cause. One student, Charlotte, a third-year history student at the University of Manchester, expressed her frustration: ""I work part-time throughout the year and during the holidays just to make ends meet. My friends and I are struggling to pay for our rent, let alone our tuition fees. It's just not fair."" Another student, Max, a second-year engineering student at the University of Cambridge, echoed Charlotte's sentiments: ""We're being priced out of our own education. The Russell Group needs to recognise that tuition fees need to be regulated in line with inflation, otherwise we'll be left with a generation of students who are drowning in debt."" The National Union of Students (NUS), which represents students in the UK, has been supporting the protests and has called for the government to introduce a cap on tuition fees, similar to the one that was in place before 2012. The NUS argues that without such a cap, students will continue to face increasing financial hardship. A spokesperson for the Russell Group said: ""Our universities are providing world-class education and research, which is attracting students from all over the world. The fees are set by the institutions, but they must also be approved by the Office for Students, which ensures that they are fair and affordable. We recognise that some students face financial challenges, and we encourage them to seek out the support that is available to them."" However, students argue that this support is not enough, and that more needs to be done to make higher education accessible to all, regardless of their financial background. The protests are set to continue, with students vowing to keep up the pressure on the Russell Group and the government to address the issue of rising tuition fees. The future of higher education in the UK remains uncertain, as the debate over fees rages on.

"Car immobiliser easy to crack, say researchers","Researchers at the International Council of E-Transportation (Iceta) have discovered a vulnerability in the encryption system used in many car immobilisers, potentially allowing a thief to bypass the security feature and steal the vehicle. The affected car brands include 26 separate manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, Porsche, and Honda. The researchers, who presented their findings at the 2023 Black Hat security conference, explained that they were able to crack the immobiliser codes by using a technique called ""brute force"" attacks. This method involves trying every possible combination of the code until the correct one is found. The researchers noted that the process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the complexity of the encryption algorithm. The impact of this vulnerability could be significant, as car immobilisers are a crucial security feature for modern vehicles. They prevent the engine from starting unless the correct code is entered, reducing the risk of theft. However, with this weakness, a thief could potentially bypass the immobiliser and steal the car. The researchers stressed that the vulnerability was not limited to any specific car model or make. Instead, it affected a wide range of vehicles produced by 26 different manufacturers. The researchers said that they had notified the affected car companies of the issue and were working with them to develop patches and updates to address the vulnerability. Car owners are being advised to take precautions to protect their vehicles. This includes parking in well-lit areas, using steering wheel locks, and investing in additional security measures such as alarms and immobilisers that use more complex encryption algorithms. The researchers also urged car companies to take the issue seriously and to prioritise the development and implementation of more secure encryption systems to protect their customers. The discovery of this vulnerability is a reminder that no security system is foolproof, and that it's essential to stay informed about the latest threats and risks. Car owners should be vigilant and take steps to protect their vehicles, while car manufacturers must prioritise the development of more robust security features to keep up with the evolving threats. The researchers also noted that this vulnerability was just one of many that could potentially affect car security. They urged car owners and manufacturers to take a holistic approach to vehicle security, addressing not only the physical security of the vehicle but also its digital security. By working together, car owners, manufacturers, and security researchers can help reduce the risk of car theft and protect the safety and security of drivers and their vehicles.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cocaine smuggling: The bizarre tactics used to hide drugs,"But sneaking drugs under the noses of authorities can be a risky business, as a Colombian cocaine smuggler discovered this week. The man was caught at Barcelona's Josep Tarradellas Airport with 0.5kg (1.1lb) of cocaine hidden in his luggage. His attempt to evade detection was unsuccessful, but the tactics used by drug smugglers to hide their illicit cargo have become increasingly creative and bizarre. One smuggling method involves using ""bodypackers,"" individuals who swallow condoms filled with drugs or hide them in their body cavities. In a recent incident, a woman was stopped at Heathrow Airport with over 2kg (4.4lb) of cocaine concealed in her stomach. She had swallowed the packets, which were later recovered during a medical examination. This method is dangerous, as the drugs can cause serious health problems and even prove fatal if they rupture or are not expelled naturally. Another bizarre tactic involves using livestock as a means of transportation. In 2019, Colombian authorities discovered 15kg (33lb) of cocaine hidden inside the carcasses of pigs on a farm in the department of Antioquia. The drugs were carefully placed within the meat, making it impossible to detect without a thorough examination. This method has been used successfully on numerous occasions, with smugglers relying on the large size of livestock to conceal their cargo. A more recent trend involves the use of drones to transport drugs across borders. In 2020, Spanish police intercepted a drone flying from Morocco with 1kg (2.2lb) of cocaine hidden inside. The drone was equipped with a sophisticated GPS system, allowing it to fly a predetermined route and avoid detection. This method poses a significant threat to law enforcement agencies, as it is difficult to detect and prevent the use of drones. Furthermore, some smugglers have resorted to using ingenious disguises to blend in with the crowd. In 2018, a man was caught at Madrid's Barajas Airport dressed as a priest, with 1.5kg (3.3lb) of cocaine hidden in his robe. The man was able to evade detection for hours, as he blended in with the crowd of travelers and was not suspected of carrying drugs. In conclusion, the tactics used by cocaine smugglers to hide their drugs have become increasingly creative and bizarre. From bodypackers and livestock to drones and disguises, smugglers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection. These methods pose a significant threat to law enforcement agencies and demonstrate the need for enhanced security measures and cooperation between countries to combat drug trafficking.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Singer Ruth Keggin 'breathes life' into ancient language,"By Mark Edwards, BBC Isle of Man Ruth Keggin's debut solo album, ""Awaramma: Breaths,"" is a captivating exploration of the rich cultural heritage of the Isle of Man. The 25-year-old singer breathes new life into ancient language through her unique interpretations of traditional and contemporary folk songs, most of which are sung in the Gaelic language known as Manx. Speaking to BBC, Keggin expressed her deep connection to her Manx roots. ""Manx never died,"" she said, her eyes shining with passion. ""It's still alive in the hearts and minds of the people of the Isle of Man."" Nestled between the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the Isle of Man is a unique place, with its own distinct history, language, and traditions. Manx, the native Gaelic language of the island, has been spoken for over 1,000 years but fell out of common usage in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Today, it is estimated that around 1,500 people speak Manx fluently, making it an increasingly rare and precious part of the island's heritage. Keggin, who grew up in the village of Patrick, is part of a new generation of Manx musicians and artists who are working to revive and celebrate their cultural heritage. Her debut album, ""Awaramma: Breaths,"" is a testament to this renewed interest in Manx language and tradition. The title of the album comes from the Manx words ""awar"" meaning ""breath"" and ""manna"" meaning ""man,"" representing the breath of life that Manx language and culture bring to the people of the Isle of Man. The album features a range of traditional and contemporary folk songs, each one beautifully arranged and performed in Manx. Keggin's voice is clear, powerful, and expressive, bringing the words to life in a way that resonates deeply with listeners. One of the standout tracks on the album is ""Cassan na Marday,"" a traditional Manx lullaby. Keggin's hauntingly beautiful rendition of the song is a reminder of the power of music to transport us to another place and time. Another highlight is ""Sleean,"" a contemporary folk song by Manx artist Derek Harris. Keggin's interpretation of the song is both soulful and uplifting, showcasing her versatility as a singer and her deep connection to the Manx musical tradition. Through her music, Ruth Keggin is helping to keep the Manx language and culture alive for future generations.

Chinese doctors jailed for illegal organ harvesting,"organs of at least 45 victims, most of whom were Falun Gong practitioners, in a series of surgeries carried out at the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region's No. 2 Hospital. The shocking revelation came to light after a joint investigation by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC) and the International People's Tribunal on Organ Harvesting from China. The group had tricked the families of the deceased into thinking they were making official organ donations. Between 2017 and 2018, they removed the organs of at least 45 victims, most of whom were Falun Gong practitioners. The victims had either been sentenced to death or were otherwise subjects of enforced disappearance. The perpetrators included Dr. Liang Montian, the former vice-president of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region's No. 2 Hospital, along with two surgeons, Dr. Zhang Shibo and Dr. Liu Yunzhu. According to the investigation, the three doctors and their associates carried out the illegal organ harvesting under the guise of performing routine surgeries, such as liver transplants and kidney transplants. The victims were often given sedatives or anesthetics to render them unconscious before the surgeries, which were then carried out without their consent. The investigation also revealed that the organ trafficking ring was part of a wider network that extended to other hospitals and prison camps in the region. The organs were then sold to transplant tourism patients from around the world, generating significant profits for the perpetrators. The revelation of this organ harvesting ring is yet another grim reminder of the ongoing human rights abuses in China, particularly against the Falun Gong community. The Chinese government has long been accused of forced organ harvesting, with the Falun Gong being disproportionately affected due to their religious beliefs and perceived political dissidence. The Chinese authorities have yet to comment on the investigation, but it is not the first time such allegations have been made. In 2006, former Canadian MP David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas published a report that concluded that there was a large-scale, state-sanctioned organ harvesting operation targeting Falun Gong practitioners in China. Since then, numerous other investigations and reports have corroborated these findings. The international community has expressed concern over the situation, with many countries calling on China to end the practice of forced organ harvesting and to allow unfettered access to its transplant centers to verify the source of the organs. However, China has thus far refused to cooperate, citing its sovereignty and the need to protect patient confidentiality.

Times and Sunday Times readership falls after paywall,"Times Online, the digital arm of The Times and The Sunday Times, once registered an impressive 21 million unique users per month to its front page earlier this year. However, the introduction of a paywall in July 2010 has led to a significant drop in readership. According to recent reports, the number of unique users accessing the websites has fallen dramatically, with the figure standing at just 2.7 million in the first month after the paywall was implemented. This represents a staggering 88% decline in traffic, leaving some industry experts questioning the wisdom of the move. The paywall, which requires users to pay a subscription fee to access articles after viewing a certain number of free articles each month, was introduced as part of a new business model aimed at increasing revenue and reducing the reliance on advertising revenue. However, the sharp drop in readership has raised concerns that the move may have been premature. The Times and The Sunday Times are not the first newspapers to introduce a paywall, with The Financial Times and The New York Times also adopting similar models. However, the drop in readership at The Times and The Sunday Times is more pronounced than at these other titles, leading some to suggest that the paywall may not be the right solution for these newspapers. One reason for the drop in readership could be the high price of subscriptions. The basic subscription for unlimited access to both websites costs Â£12 per week, or Â£26 per month, which is more than some people are willing to pay for online news. Additionally, the websites do not offer a free trial period, making it difficult for potential subscribers to test the service before committing to a subscription. Another factor could be the increasing popularity of free news websites, such as the BBC News website and Google News, which offer a wealth of free news content. These websites have seen a surge in traffic in recent months, with many users turning to them for their news fix instead of paying for access to The Times and The Sunday Times. Despite the drop in readership, some industry experts believe that the paywall will ultimately prove to be a successful business model for The Times and The Sunday Times. They argue that the newspapers have a loyal readership base who are willing to pay for high-quality journalism, and that the paywall will help to reduce the number of casual readers who were not contributing significantly to the revenue. However, it is clear that the introduction of the paywall has had a significant impact on the readership of The Times and The Sunday Times, and that the newspapers will need to work hard to win back their lost readers and attract new ones. Whether this can be achieved remains to be seen. In the meantime, The Times and The Sunday Times continue to offer some free content, including a limited number of articles per month and some breaking news stories. They also offer discounts for students, over-60s, and those on low incomes, in an attempt to make",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mexico: We will not pay for Trump border wall,"Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, the President of Mexico, expressed his regret over Donald Trump's plans to construct a wall along the US-Mexico border during a press conference on Monday. However, he made no indication of cancelling a forthcoming trip to Washington to meet with the US President. ""I regret the decision of the President of the United States to build a wall,"" PeÃ±a Nieto declared, reiterating Mexico's long-standing position against footing the bill for the controversial barrier. ""Mexico does not believe in walls. I've said time and again: Mexico will not pay for any wall."" Trump, who has made building a wall along the southern border a cornerstone of his campaign and presidency, responded to PeÃ±a Nieto's comments with a tweet. ""The United States of America will, of course, pay for the wall,"" he wrote, adding, ""Mexico, in some form, might have to come along and make a contribution toward greater security in North America."" Despite Trump's assertion, there is no clear path for how the US would finance the wall, which could cost up to $25 billion according to some estimates. PeÃ±a Nieto's stance on the issue has been consistent since before Trump's election, with Mexican officials making it clear that Mexico would not contribute financially to the wall. The tension between the two leaders has been escalating since Trump's campaign, with PeÃ±a Nieto repeatedly expressing his disappointment and frustration over the proposed wall. In January, the Mexican President told a news conference that ""the Mexican government does not believe in walls,"" adding that ""walls do not solve problems."" The prospect of a wall has sparked widespread opposition in Mexico, with many seeing it as an affront to their national pride and sovereignty. PeÃ±a Nieto's decision to press ahead with the Washington trip, despite the looming wall issue, has been seen by some as a sign of his determination to maintain good relations with the US, Mexico's biggest trading partner. However, the wall issue is not the only point of contention between the two leaders. Trump's crackdown on immigration, including his executive order to withhold federal funding from so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" has also drawn sharp criticism from Mexican officials. As the two leaders prepare to meet, it remains to be seen how they will navigate their differences on these and other issues. One thing is clear, though: the wall issue is not going away anytime soon. And while PeÃ±a Nieto has made it clear that Mexico will not pay for it, the US President has shown no sign of backing down from his campaign promise.

Tiananmen crash: China police 'detain suspects',"Police have described the incident as a ""violent terror attack,"" the Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday, marking the first time Chinese authorities have used such language to characterize the events that unfolded in the heart of Beijing's Tiananmen Square on October 1st. The car involved in the crash that left several people dead and dozens injured was driven by a man from the Muslim Uighur minority, along with two women, according to Xinhua. The identities of the individuals have not been officially confirmed, but Chinese state media outlets have reported their names and suggested they were from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The incident occurred when the car, driving at high speed, plowed into a crowd of pedestrians and tourists in Tiananmen Square, sending panic and chaos through the iconic public space. Witnesses reported hearing several explosions, and images and videos shared on social media showed a scene of chaos, with bystanders rushing to help the injured and police and emergency services responding to the scene. The Chinese government has been quick to label the incident a ""violent terror attack,"" a term often used to describe incidents it deems to be acts of terrorism perpetrated by members of the Uighur minority. The Xinjiang region has seen a surge in violence in recent years, with the Chinese government blaming separatist and extremist groups for a series of attacks on police and civilians. Chinese authorities have imposed strict security measures in the region, including increased surveillance, mass detention of Uighurs, and restrictions on religious and cultural practices. Human rights groups have condemned these measures as violations of basic human rights, and there have been widespread reports of abuses against Uighurs in detention facilities. The incident in Tiananmen Square has sparked outrage and concern both within China and internationally. Some have called for an independent investigation into the incident, while others have expressed concern about the Chinese government's response and the potential for further violence and repression. Police have detained several suspects in connection with the incident, Xinhua reported, but no further details have been provided about their identities or the nature of their alleged involvement. The Chinese government has vowed to bring those responsible to justice and to maintain stability in the capital. As the situation unfolds, the international community is closely watching China's response and the aftermath of the incident. The Chinese government has a history of cracking down on dissent and perceived threats to its authority, and there are concerns that the incident in Tiananmen Square could be used as an opportunity to further restrict civil liberties and increase surveillance and repression in the country.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

MEPs vote for universal charger for smartphones,"The resolution passed with 582 votes in favour to 40 against. MEPs, representing the European Parliament, have now adopted a call for the European Commission (EC) to mandate a universal charging solution for all types of smartphones. This decision marks a significant step towards reducing electronic waste and promoting consumer convenience. The European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee proposed the resolution, which was supported by various political groups. This cross-party approach signifies a strong desire for a unified charging standard among the diverse European population. The EC is expected to respond to this call within two months. If the EC agrees to the proposal, it could lead to a significant shift in the smartphone industry. The adoption of a universal charging solution would mean an end to the proliferation of various charger types and cable connections. This move would not only benefit consumers but also the environment. According to a report by the European Parliament, approximately 11,000 tonnes of electronic waste are generated annually due to discarded charging equipment. A universal charging solution could help reduce this waste significantly. MEPs have also called for the EC to consider the potential economic impact of this change. A study by the European Parliament estimates that the cost of purchasing multiple chargers for each new smartphone could amount to â¬2.4 billion annually. The implementation of a universal charging solution could save consumers an estimated â¬900 million per year. The European Parliament's decision comes in line with similar initiatives from other parts of the world. The European Union is not the first to consider a universal charging solution. South Korea, for instance, has already implemented a law mandating a universal charging port for all smartphones sold in the country. MEPs have expressed their optimism about the potential impact of this decision. ""This is a significant step towards reducing electronic waste, saving consumers money, and promoting a more sustainable future,"" said rapporteur Alex Agius Saliba. Despite the potential benefits, challenges remain. The smartphone industry has been slow to embrace a universal charging standard, citing technological and commercial reasons. The EC's response to this call will be closely watched by industry players and consumers alike. The European Parliament's decision represents a clear message to the EC and the smartphone industry. The demand for a universal charging solution is not just a consumer convenience issue but also an environmental and economic one. Only time will tell whether this call will be heeded and what the future holds for the smartphone charging landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Oil prices slump on Saudi comments,"The comments by deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia are causing ripples in the global oil market, as he signaled his country's readiness to increase production and potentially flood the market with more crude. Speaking to the Arabic-language Al Arabiya TV on Sunday, Prince Mohammed indicated that Riyadh would not be content with only maintaining current output levels, acknowledging that his country possesses the capacity to ramp up production beyond its existing quotas. Prince Mohammed's remarks came amid ongoing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, with the latter vowing to boost its own oil production following the recent lifting of Western sanctions. Iran has long been at odds with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members over regional influence, with energy being a major point of contention between the two powers. The Saudi announcement weighed heavily on oil prices, which had already been under pressure due to concerns over slowing global demand and a surge in US shale production. With the possible entry of larger volumes of crude from both Saudi Arabia and Iran, market watchers expressed concern that this could lead to a glut in supply, driving down prices even further. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, dropped below $60 a barrel for the first time since November 2017, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell below $55. These declines represent a significant reversal from earlier in the year, when oil prices had briefly spiked above $70 a barrel on concerns about potential supply disruptions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, have been working since the end of 2016 to limit production in order to support prices. However, with both Saudi Arabia and Russia indicating their readiness to increase output, the future of this production cut deal remains uncertain. Prince Mohammed's comments are also seen as a challenge to the market dominance of the OPEC cartel, which has long wielded significant influence over global oil prices. With the emergence of new producers, such as the United States, and the increasing trend towards renewable energy, the days of OPEC's unchallenged control over the oil market may be numbered. The Saudi announcement is likely to spark a renewed debate about the long-term direction of the oil market, with some experts predicting that prices could remain lower for an extended period. However, others argue that geopolitical tensions and unforeseen supply disruptions could still lead to price spikes in the future. In the meantime, consumers are likely to benefit from the current downturn in prices, with lower fuel costs offering a welcome relief for many households and businesses. However, for oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran, the impact of lower prices could be more mixed",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
HMRC claims victory in film tax battle,"The Ingenious scheme, a complex tax avoidance strategy, aimed to utilize artificial losses derived from investing in a range of films produced by the UK film industry. The scheme, challenged by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), included high-profile productions such as Avatar, Life of Pi, and Die Hard 4. The Icebreaker scheme, as it came to be known, attempted to create these artificial losses through the use of limited liability partnerships (LLPs). HMRC claimed that the scheme was an abuse of the tax system, with investors artificially inflating their losses to offset against other income. In turn, this would significantly reduce their tax liability. The scheme, however, relied on a loophole in UK tax law which permitted the capital losses incurred through the investment in films to be set against other income, such as salary or dividends. The tax authority argued that the losses were not genuine and were instead created for the sole purpose of tax avoidance. In a statement, HMRC said, ""This complex scheme was designed to artificially create losses through film investment. The investors involved were not at risk of making a real loss and, in many cases, received returns on their investment."" The scheme came under scrutiny in 2012, when HMRC launched an investigation into the tax affairs of over 300 investors. Since then, HMRC has been working to close the loophole, which was critical to the success of the Icebreaker scheme. In 2015, the UK government announced changes to the tax rules that would limit the ability of investors to offset film losses against other income. In response to HMRC's challenge, the scheme's creators, Ingenious Media, announced that they would be winding down the scheme. Over 2,000 investors in the scheme were given until the end of March 2017 to exit their investments. The decision to wind down the scheme followed a ruling by the First-tier Tax Tribunal that the scheme was not a valid tax avoidance scheme. The outcome of this tax battle is significant for both HMRC and the UK film industry. For HMRC, it represents a victory in their ongoing efforts to tackle tax avoidance and ensure that the tax system is fair for all. For the UK film industry, it highlights the importance of transparency and legitimacy in investment structures. This victory may also encourage HMRC to continue their efforts to challenge other tax avoidance schemes, particularly those that rely on complex structures and loopholes in the tax system. However, the closure of the Icebreaker scheme does not signal the end of film tax incentives in the UK. The government's film tax relief, which provides a rebate on qualifying production costs, remains an essential tool for attracting international film productions to the UK. The challenge for HMRC will be to ensure",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Colonia Dignidad: Germany to compensate Chile commune victims,"Colonia Dignidad was founded by former Nazi soldier Paul SchÃ¤fer in 1961. The commune, which was located 350km (220 miles) south of Santiago, was run as a secretive and authoritarian religious community, attracting mainly German-speaking settlers. For decades, the commune's existence was shrouded in mystery, with outsiders rarely allowed to enter. However, in the 1970s, allegations of human rights abuses began to surface. Chilean authorities accused Colonia Dignidad of being involved in various criminal activities, including child abuse, forced labour, and the illegal detention of political prisoners during the country's military dictatorship. One of the most shocking revelations came in 1996 when it was discovered that the commune had operated a torture and sexual abuse centre for children. The victims, many of whom were abducted from their families, were subjected to unspeakable acts of cruelty. Some were starved, beaten, or subjected to electric shocks, while others were forced to witness and participate in sadistic acts. The victims of Colonia Dignidad have waited decades for justice. In 2016, a Chilean court ruled that the German government was liable for damages due to its role in the establishment of the commune. The court found that the German authorities had provided financial and logistical support to SchÃ¤fer and his followers, allowing them to establish Colonia Dignidad and enabling the abuses to take place. The ruling marked a significant milestone in the victims' quest for justice. However, it also raised complex legal and diplomatic issues. The German government initially refused to pay compensation, arguing that it had no legal responsibility for the actions of a private religious community. But under mounting pressure from Chilean authorities and the victims themselves, the German government finally agreed to compensate the victims in 2019. The amount of compensation was agreed upon in a confidential settlement, with the German government reportedly paying out millions of dollars to the victims. The compensation is a small step towards healing the wounds of the past. For many of the victims, the trauma they suffered at Colonia Dignidad continues to haunt them. Some have spent years in therapy, trying to come to terms with the abuse they suffered. Others have struggled with addiction, mental health issues, and relationship problems. The compensation will help some of the victims to access the therapy and support they need to rebuild their lives. However, it cannot undo the damage that was done. The memories of the abuse they suffered will remain with them forever. Colonia Dignidad is a stark reminder of the dark chapters in Chilean and German history. It is a reminder that the scars of the past can run deep, and that the quest for justice can be a long and painful one. But it is also a reminder that justice can be served, and",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hungary government proposes same-sex adoption ban,"The Hungarian government's latest proposal has sparked controversy among human rights groups and the European Union, as it seeks to ban same-sex couples from adopting children. The proposed amendment, if passed, would specify that ""the mother is a woman, the father is a man"" and permit only married heterosexual couples to adopt children. Same-sex marriage is illegal in Hungary, and this new measure further solidifies the country's stance on traditional family structures. The Hungarian Minister of Human Capacities, ZoltÃ¡n Balogh, announced the proposed amendment on Tuesday, stating that ""the protection of children is a priority for us,"" as reported by Reuters. The government argues that children deserve to grow up in a family with a mother and a father, emphasizing the importance of preserving ""the traditional family model."" However, critics argue that the proposed amendment would infringe upon the human rights of same-sex couples and their potential children. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, expressed his concern, stating that ""discrimination in any form is unacceptable,"" and that the European Union ""expects all member states to respect the fundamental rights of every citizen."" Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor OrbÃ¡n, has been under fire for his conservative policies in recent years, with opponents claiming that his government is moving the country towards an authoritarian state. Critics point to the crackdown on civil society organizations, the restructuring of the judiciary, and the targeting of academic freedom as evidence of this trend. The proposed adoption ban is seen as another step in this direction. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization based in Budapest, has announced its intention to challenge the proposed amendment in the European Court of Human Rights. The organization argues that the ban violates the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8, which guarantees the right to private and family life. The proposed adoption ban has also drawn criticism from within Hungary, with many citizens taking to social media to express their opposition. The LGBTQ+ community in Hungary is small but vocal, and they have organized protests against the ban in Budapest and other major cities. The European Union has given the Hungarian government until the end of the year to reconsider the proposed amendment, but it remains to be seen whether OrbÃ¡n will back down in the face of international pressure. In the meantime, the debate continues, with both sides passionately arguing for their respective positions. The future of same-sex adoption in Hungary remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: this issue is far from resolved.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
A83 Rest and Be Thankful reopens after landslip,"Workers have been toiling tirelessly to clear 1,000 tonnes of debris from the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A83, following a series of landslips that occurred last month. The slippages, caused by heavy rainfall and unstable ground conditions, had forced the closure of this essential artery connecting the Argyll and Bute region with the rest of Scotland. Meanwhile, the Scottish government has been trying to find a permanent solution to prevent further landslips in this area, which is prone to geological instability. The Rest and Be Thankful pass, located between Loch Long and Loch Fyne, has a long history of landslides, making it a constant challenge for transportation officials. The Scottish Transport Minister, Grahame Dey, acknowledged the importance of reopening the A83 as soon as possible, stating, ""We are committed to ensuring that the A83 is open and accessible for local communities and businesses as soon as it is safe to do so."" To expedite the process, the Scottish government has brought in additional resources, including heavy machinery and geotechnical experts. The operation to remove the debris and stabilize the slope involves the use of rock anchors, drainage systems, and other measures to prevent future landslips. The closure of the A83 has caused significant inconvenience for the local residents and businesses in the area. The diversion route, which involves a longer journey through Inveraray and Tarbet, has added extra hours to daily commutes and increased transportation costs for businesses. The Scottish government has expressed its deepest sympathies to those affected by the road closure and has been working closely with the local council and community leaders to mitigate the impact. In the meantime, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has been monitoring the water levels in the nearby lochs and rivers to ensure that the landslips do not pose a threat to the local communities. The reopening of the A83 is expected to take several weeks, but the Scottish government and the transport team are working around the clock to ensure a swift and safe return to normalcy. As the workers make progress in their efforts to restore the A83, the local community remains hopeful that they will soon be able to resume their daily routines unhindered. The Rest and Be Thankful pass, as its name suggests, has always been a source of gratitude for the resilience and determination of the people of Argyll and Bute and their unwavering spirit in the face of adversity. The Scottish government, along with the transport team, remains committed to finding a long-term solution to prevent future landslips and ensure the safety and accessibility of this vital transportation route. As the workers continue their laborious task, the community eagerly awaits the day when they can once again be thankful for the Rest and Be Thankful pass.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

However, in an effort to make the process more accessible and user-friendly, a new e-petitions website has recently opened its doors. This new platform, which is run by the Cabinet Office, is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a ""new dialogue"" with MPs. With a simpler design and easier navigation, the site aims to encourage more people to engage with the petitioning process and hold their representatives accountable. One of the most notable features of the new website is its mobile-friendly design, which allows users to easily access and sign petitions on the go. This is a significant improvement over the previous site, which was criticised for being difficult to use on mobile devices. Another important change is the reduction of the signature threshold required for a petition to be considered for debate in Parliament. While the old site required 100,000 signatures for a debate to be granted, the new site has lowered this threshold to 5,000 signatures for UK petitions and 10,000 signatures for petitions relating to devolved matters in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland. The new website also includes a number of new features aimed at making the petitioning process more transparent and inclusive. For example, users can now view the progress of petitions in real time and see how many signatures they have received. Additionally, the site includes a feature that allows users to leave comments on petitions, enabling a more open and productive dialogue between petitioners and their MPs. However, while the new website offers many improvements, it is important to remember that the petitioning process is just one way that individuals can engage with their representatives and make their voices heard. It is also crucial that people continue to write to their MPs, attend public meetings, and get involved in their local communities to ensure that their concerns are being addressed. Overall, the new e-petitions website represents a significant step forward in making the petitioning process more accessible and inclusive. By making it easier for people to engage with their MPs and get their issues on the political agenda, the site is helping to foster a more open and participatory democracy. And with its user-friendly design, mobile-friendly functionality, and lower signature thresholds, the new website is sure to encourage more people to get involved and make their voices heard.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Jermaine Jackson: 'No truth' to allegations in Michael documentary,"In Leaving Neverland, James Safechuck and Wade Robson make shocking allegations against Michael Jackson, claiming they were abused by the singer as children. Mr. Robson, who once testified in Jackson's defense during a previous trial, now asserts that the pop icon groomed and molested him for years, starting when he was seven. However, Jermaine Jackson, the late singer's older brother, has refuted these claims, stating unequivocally that there is ""no truth"" to the allegations made against Michael in the HBO documentary. Speaking to the BBC, Jermaine expressed his deep disappointment and frustration, stating, ""We're talking about my brother, and this is a man who's not here to defend himself."" Mr. Jackson went on to describe his brother as a kind and nurturing figure, a devoted father, and an exceptional artist. ""Michael was not a child molester. He was not a pedophile. He was a beautiful soul, and he meant so much to so many people,"" Jermaine asserted. The Jackson family has long maintained that the allegations against Michael are baseless and that the accusers are seeking financial gain and fame. In light of this, Jermaine expressed concern over the potential impact of the documentary on Michael's legacy. ""My brother's legacy is being destroyed. And it's so sad, because he did so much good in the world,"" he lamented. Mr. Robson acted as Michael Jackson's choreographer and friend for years, andSafechuck spent time at the singer's Neverland Ranch. The documentary includes graphic descriptions of alleged sexual abuse and has renewed interest in the investigations into Michael Jackson's conduct. Despite the renewed focus on the allegations, Jermaine remains steadfast in his belief in his brother's innocence. ""Michael Jackson was a victim of a witch hunt. And it's sad that people are still buying into this,"" he said. The Jackson family has filed a $100 million lawsuit against HBO, alleging that the documentary is defamatory and a violation of Michael's rights. Jermaine expressed hope that the truth would eventually come out and that his brother's legacy would be restored. In the face of renewed scrutiny, Jermaine Jackson remains a steadfast defender of his brother's memory, insisting that there is ""no truth"" to the allegations made against Michael Jackson in Leaving Neverland.

Robot used to guide surgeons through knee operations,"By Eleanor Bradford, BBC Scotland Health Correspondent The technique is being tested at Glasgow Royal Infirmary where 150 patients are involved in trials. It is part of a collaboration between surgeons, bio-engineers and a US health care company, and could result in more accurate and efficient knee operations. The robot in question is called the Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted System, and it is designed to assist surgeons in performing total knee replacements. The surgeon begins the procedure in the usual way, making an incision and preparing the area for the operation. But instead of manually guiding the replacement joint into place, the surgeon uses the robot to guide the placement of the implant. The robot is programmed with the individual patient's data, including their anatomy and any deformities. This information is gathered through pre-operative CT scans and 3D modelling. The surgeon then uses the robot to make small adjustments during the operation, ensuring that the implant is placed accurately and precisely. This level of customization is believed to lead to better outcomes for patients, including reduced pain and improved mobility. The robot also allows for a more minimally invasive approach. The incision required for a robotic-assisted knee replacement is typically smaller than those used in traditional knee replacements. This can lead to quicker recovery times and reduced scarring for the patient. The trials at Glasgow Royal Infirmary are ongoing, and the early results are promising. Dr. David McAllister, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital, has been involved in the project and has praised the technology for its accuracy and precision. He believes that it could become a standard part of knee replacement procedures in the future. However, the use of robots in surgery is not without its challenges. The cost of the technology is a significant barrier, with the Mako system costing around Â£1.5 million. There are also concerns about the training required for surgeons to use the system effectively. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of robotic-assisted surgery are significant. The accuracy and precision afforded by the technology could lead to better outcomes for patients, with reduced pain, improved mobility, and quicker recovery times. The trials at Glasgow Royal Infirmary are just the beginning, and it will be interesting to see how this technology develops in the future. In conclusion, the use of robots in knee operations is a promising development in the field of orthopaedic surgery. The Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted System is being trialled at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, with early results suggesting that it could lead to more accurate and efficient knee replacements. While there are challenges to overcome, the potential benefits of this technology are significant, and it could become a standard part of knee replacement procedures in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
RBS pulls Samsung Galaxy S10 app over security flaw,"Last week, users of the Samsung Galaxy S10 discovered a concerning issue with the device's fingerprint authentication system. It was found that when the phone was used with certain screen protectors, the device could be unlocked by anyone who touched the screen. This security flaw left many S10 owners feeling vulnerable and exposed. In response to this issue, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has temporarily pulled its mobile banking apps from the Samsung Galaxy Store. S10 owners will be unable to download or update the RBS apps until the issue is resolved. RBS issued a statement saying, ""We take the security of our customers' accounts seriously and have taken the decision to remove our mobile banking apps from the Samsung Galaxy Store whilst we investigate this issue further. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."" This decision comes as a blow to Samsung and RBS, both of whom have been working to improve mobile banking security. Samsung has released a statement acknowledging the issue and assuring customers that they are working to find a solution. The issue appears to be caused by a small gap created by some screen protectors, which allows the phone's fingerprint scanner to read the print even when it is not in contact with the user's finger. This has raised concerns about the reliability of fingerprint authentication as a security measure, especially for financial transactions. The incident highlights the importance of robust security measures, particularly in the financial sector. Banks and financial institutions are constantly under threat from cybercriminals, and any vulnerability in their systems can lead to significant financial losses and damage to their reputation. Samsung and RBS are not the first to face such an issue. In 2019, a similar problem was reported with the OnePlus 7T Pro, which could be unlocked by using a plastic screen protector. OnePlus issued a patch to address the issue, but it underscores the importance of ongoing testing and patching to ensure the security of mobile devices. As the use of mobile devices for banking and financial transactions continues to grow, it is essential that manufacturers and financial institutions prioritise security. This includes not only robust authentication systems but also regular testing and patching to address any vulnerabilities that may arise. In the meantime, S10 owners who rely on RBS mobile banking apps are advised to use alternative methods to access their accounts, such as online banking or branch visits. RBS has also advised users to remove any third-party screen protectors and use the phone without one until a solution is found. The incident serves as a reminder that no technology is foolproof, and that users must remain vigilant and take steps to protect their devices and personal information. It also underscores the importance of regular software updates and security checks to ensure the ongoing security of mobile devices.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Parking fine appeal success varies between council areas,"Some English councils approve only one in 10 appeals against on-street fines, while others accept nearly every one. Runnymede Council in Surrey accepted just 9% of appeals, the lowest rate in England, while Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council in Hampshire approved 12% of appeals in the same period. The stark contrast in the success rates of appeals between different councils has raised concerns among motorists and legal experts. The Freedom of Information Act requests by the Press Association revealed that the approval rates for appeals against parking fines varied significantly across the country. In contrast, some councils had approval rates above 50%. For instance, South Holland District Council in Lincolnshire accepted 59% of appeals, followed by Wiltshire Council with 56%, and North Norfolk District Council with 53%. The reasons for these stark differences are complex and multifaceted. Some councils may have more lenient enforcement policies, while others may have more stringent rules or may be more rigorous in their assessment of appeals. Motorists who receive parking fines may feel frustrated and aggrieved when their appeals are rejected, especially if they believe they have a valid case. However, councils argue that they have a duty to enforce parking regulations fairly and consistently. The British Parking Association, which represents the parking industry, emphasizes that the parking appeals process is designed to be fair and transparent. The association recommends that motorists should read the parking signage carefully before leaving their vehicles, and should consider appealing the fine only if they have a strong case. Legal experts advise motorists to prepare a clear and detailed case when appealing a parking fine. This may include providing evidence such as photographs or witness statements, as well as explaining the circumstances of the parking infringement in detail. However, even with a strong case, success is not guaranteed. The ultimate decision rests with the council, and their decision-making process can be complex and opaque to outsiders. The variations in appeals success rates between councils also raise questions about the consistency and fairness of the parking enforcement system as a whole. Some motorists argue that the system is biased towards councils that prioritize revenue generation over customer service. The Government has announced plans to review the parking appeals process to ensure that it is fair, transparent, and consistent across the country. This review is expected to report its findings in the coming months, and may lead to changes in the way that parking appeals are handled and decided. In the meantime, motorists who receive parking fines and wish to appeal should prepare a clear and detailed case, and should consider seeking legal advice if they believe they have a strong case. They may also wish to contact their local council to understand the reasons for the decision and to request a review of the case.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Government body had 'concerns' over Pangbourne pesticide spray,"By Linda Serck, BBC News, South East England A government body had concerns over the use of pesticides in the picturesque village of Pangbourne, but still permitted spraying to take place at two copses. A Freedom of Information request showed Natural England's worries about the method being used to kill off the larvae of a caterpillar. The endangered small copper butterfly relies on the two copses, known as Bradfield Copse and Salt Hill Copse, for breeding. The spraying was intended to control the invasion of invasive species, such as the grey willow beetle, which were threatening the native trees. However, Natural England expressed reservations about the use of the pesticide, stating that ""the method of application could potentially impact on small copper butterfly larvae in the area."" The body, which is the government's advisor on the natural environment, recommended that alternative measures be considered. Despite these concerns, the Environment Agency, which is responsible for regulating the use of pesticides, granted permission for the spraying to go ahead. An Environment Agency spokesperson said that ""appropriate measures had been put in place to minimise any potential impact on the small copper butterfly population."" The decision has sparked controversy among local residents and environmental groups. The Pangbourne and District Natural History Society has criticised the use of pesticides, stating that ""there are alternative, more environmentally-friendly methods of controlling invasive species."" The small copper butterfly is a rare species in the UK, with a population of only around 1,000. It is listed as a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, which aims to prevent extinction of endangered species and improve their status in the wild. The use of pesticides in the area has raised questions about the effectiveness of current regulations in protecting endangered species. Some critics argue that more needs to be done to encourage the use of alternative, less harmful methods of controlling invasive species. Natural England has urged the Environment Agency to reconsider its decision and explore other options. The agency has stated that it will review the situation and consider alternative methods in the future. The controversy over the use of pesticides in Pangbourne highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing the need to control invasive species with the need to protect endangered species and maintain biodiversity. It also underscores the importance of transparency and public engagement in decisions that affect the natural environment.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Russian iTunes Store shows porn images by mistake,"Movies without images have been linking to an xxx.xxx web address on the Russian iTunes Store, causing a stir among users. The unexpected discovery was made last week when some users noticed that certain movies, all of which were missing their promotional images, contained the inappropriate URL instead. The intention behind this error might have been to link to a placeholder, said one IT expert, but the mistake has left many users feeling uncomfortable and confused. Apple has not yet commented on the issue, but users have taken to social media to express their concerns. ""I was browsing the Russian iTunes Store when I came across a movie with no image, only a title and price. Curiosity got the best of me, and I clicked on it, only to be met with a webpage filled with adult content,"" said one user on Twitter. Another user added, ""I was looking for a movie for my kids to watch, and I came across this. It's really not appropriate for the iTunes Store."" The Russian iTunes Store is operated by Apple's local partner, LLC Apple Sales Russia, which is responsible for the content and management of the store. It is not clear how the error occurred or how long it has been in effect. Some users have speculated that the error could be the result of a hack or a cyber attack on the Russian iTunes Store, but others believe it could be a simple mistake. ""It's definitely not a good look for Apple or their Russian partner,"" said another IT expert. ""They need to get this fixed as soon as possible to prevent any further damage to their reputation."" Apple has a history of taking swift action to address any issues on its digital stores, and it is expected that they will take steps to rectify the situation as soon as possible. In the meantime, users are being advised to exercise caution when browsing the Russian iTunes Store and to avoid clicking on any suspicious links. The incident highlights the importance of regular checks and quality control measures to prevent such errors from occurring in the first place. It also serves as a reminder that even the biggest and most reputable companies can make mistakes, and that users need to be vigilant when using digital platforms. Apple's Russian partner, LLC Apple Sales Russia, has yet to issue a statement on the issue, and it is not clear when the problem will be resolved. In the meantime, users are advised to check their accounts for any unexpected charges and to contact Apple's customer support if they have any concerns.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Megan Lee: Takeaway bosses jailed over allergy death,"Megan Lee, a 15-year-old girl from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, suffered irreversible brain damage after having an allergic reaction to food from Royal Spice in October 2016. The incident took place when Megan and her friends went out for a meal to celebrate a friend's birthday. Mohammed Abdul Kuddus, the restaurant owner, and Harun Rashid, a kitchen worker, were found guilty of failing to provide adequate allergy information and serving Megan a dish containing nuts despite her clearly stated allergy. At Manchester Crown Court on Monday, Abdul Kuddus, 49, and Rashid, 31, were jailed for their negligence, which led to Megan's life-altering injury. Abdul Kuddus was sentenced to 18 months in prison, while Rashid received a 12-month sentence. The court heard that both men had shown a ""blatant disregard"" for Megan's allergy and had not provided adequate training to their staff regarding food allergens. The jury was told that Megan had ordered a chicken tikka masala, which she had eaten many times before without incident. However, on this occasion, the dish contained cashew nuts, which Megan was severely allergic to. She began to feel unwell shortly after starting her meal and soon after, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Members of her party raised the alarm, and Megan was rushed to hospital where she was placed in an induced coma. Doctors diagnosed Megan with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. She remained in a coma for several weeks and, when she finally woke up, she was unable to walk or speak. Megan's family described her as a bright, lively girl who loved to dance and sing. They were heartbroken to see her lying in a hospital bed, unable to do the things she once loved. Lawyers for Megan's family said that the incident could have been prevented if proper procedures had been in place at the restaurant. They called for stricter regulations and better training for staff regarding food allergies. The case has highlighted the importance of taking allergies seriously and the potentially devastating consequences of failing to do so. Megan's family have launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the costs of her ongoing treatment and rehabilitation. They have also set up a support group for families affected by food allergies, to help raise awareness and provide advice and support to those in similar situations. Megan's story serves as a tragic reminder of the importance of taking food allergies seriously and the potential consequences of failing to do so. The two men's negligence has left Megan with a life-changing injury, and her family and friends are left to pick up the pieces and support",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
EasyJet half-year loss widens on weaker pound,"The airline recorded a loss of Â£212m in the six months to March, a significant wideness from the loss of Â£21m in the same period a year ago. This disappointing result comes as EasyJet grapples with the double whammy of Brexit-related currency fluctuations and higher fuel costs. In the financial year ending September 2018, EasyJet reported a profit of Â£621m, but the weaker pound has dealt a harsh blow to the airline's bottom line. The pound's decline against the euro has increased the cost of fuel and other essentials, which are predominantly bought in euros. In the first half of the current financial year, EasyJet's fuel costs were up by Â£200m compared to the same period in the previous year. Moreover, the timing of Easter this year did not help EasyJet's cause. In the same period last year, Easter fell in March and boosted demand for flights, leading to higher revenues. This year, Easter was in April, which meant that the peak travel period fell outside of the reporting period, further dampening the airline's revenue figures. EasyJet's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, acknowledged the challenging market conditions in a statement, saying: ""The first half of the financial year has been characterised by a number of external factors, most notably the significant depreciation of the pound against the euro, which has had a material impact on our fuel and other non-fuel costs."" Despite the challenging first half of the financial year, EasyJet remains optimistic about the rest of the year. The airline expects to see an increase in demand during the summer season, and it has also announced plans to expand its network. EasyJet will launch new routes to Croatia, Cyprus, and Iceland, and it will also increase the number of flights to popular destinations such as Palma, Majorca, and Malaga. The airline's strong brand and competitive pricing have helped it weather previous economic downturns, and it remains well-positioned to take advantage of any uptick in demand. EasyJet's focus on cost control and operational efficiency will also be crucial in mitigating the impact of external factors beyond its control, such as fuel prices and exchange rates. In conclusion, EasyJet's half-year loss widened significantly due to the weaker pound and higher fuel costs. The airline was also hit by the timing of Easter this year, which fell outside of the reporting period and failed to boost revenues as it did last year. Despite these challenges, EasyJet remains confident about the rest of the financial year and plans to expand its network to capitalize on increased demand.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Everest: Top Sherpas slam Nepal's plan to clean rubbish from mountain,"By Surendra Phuyal, BBC Nepali The government says the army will be used for the task, which will cost 860 million Nepali rupees ($7.5m; Â£5.7m). Last year, Nepal's tourism minister, Yatayat Rana, announced plans to clean up the world's highest mountain, Everest, from the rubbish left by climbers. This has sparked outrage among the Sherpa community, who have long been the backbone of the mountain's climbing industry. Sherpas, an ethnic group originating from the eastern Himalayas, have been guiding climbers up Everest for decades. They have faced numerous risks, including avalanches, altitude sickness, and extreme weather conditions, to help foreign climbers reach the summit. However, they have received little recognition and compensation for their efforts. The proposed clean-up plan has raised concerns about the safety of Sherpas, who will be responsible for carrying the waste down from the mountain. According to Ang Tshering Sherpa, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, the government has not consulted with the Sherpa community about the plan, let alone provided them with proper safety equipment and training. ""The government's plan to clean up Everest is a public relations stunt,"" Ang Tshering told the BBC. ""They are not considering the safety and welfare of the Sherpas who will do the dirty work. We have lost too many lives on this mountain already."" Sagarman Tamang, a Sherpa climber and environmentalist, shares similar concerns. ""The government's plan is not well thought out,"" he said. ""They are not considering the long-term impact on the mountain and the Sherpa community. We need a sustainable solution that benefits everyone."" The Sherpas' concerns come as the number of climbers on Everest continues to rise, with over 800 people attempting to summit the mountain last year alone. The influx of climbers has led to an increase in waste, with an estimated 25,000kg (55,000lbs) of trash left on the mountain, according to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The government has promised to hire local workers to help with the clean-up effort, but Sherpas worry that they will be the ones doing the heavy lifting. They are calling for a more collaborative approach that involves proper planning, training, and compensation. ""We want to work with the government to find a solution that benefits everyone,"" Ang Tshering said. ""But we cannot do it alone. We need the support of the international community and the climbing industry to make this a success."" As the debate continues, the future of Everest's clean-up remains uncertain. One thing is clear, however: the Sherpas, who have sacrificed so much to make the mountain",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Concern raised over changes to probation service,"By the beginning of next year, 70% of the probation service's work in England and Wales will be run by private companies and charities. The UK government announced this plan with the intention of reducing costs and improving efficiency in the criminal justice system. However, this decision has raised significant concerns among stakeholders, including probation officers, unions, and advocacy groups. The National Probation Service (NPS), which is currently responsible for supervising high-risk offenders, will be merged with the Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) and the charities, forming a new entity called the Probation, Diversion and Rehabilitation Service. The government argues that this change will lead to a more competitive market, driving down costs and improving the quality of services. However, critics of the plan argue that it could lead to a two-tier system, where high-risk offenders are left to the public sector while low-risk cases are handed over to private companies. This could result in a lack of resources and expertise for dealing with complex cases, which could ultimately increase the risk of reoffending. Probation officers, who are concerned about their jobs and the future of the service, have also raised concerns about the potential impact on the quality of supervision. They argue that the new model could lead to a fragmented service, with insufficient resources and support for offenders. The National Probation Officers' Association (NPOA) has warned that the changes could lead to a ""race to the bottom"" in terms of wages and working conditions for probation officers. The union representing probation staff, the Napo, has called for a review of the government's plans, arguing that the changes could put public safety at risk. Napo general secretary Chris Henley said, ""We believe the government's plans will put the public at greater risk by leading to a fragmented, underfunded and understaffed probation service."" Advocacy groups have also expressed concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and people with mental health issues. They argue that the new model could lead to a lack of understanding and expertise in dealing with complex cases, which could result in poorer outcomes for offenders. Despite these concerns, the government has insisted that the changes will lead to a more efficient and effective probation service. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has said that the new model will ""ensure that we are providing the right support in the right places for those who need it most."" However, with many questions remaining about the impact of the changes on the quality of services, the future of probation staff, and the potential risks to public safety, it remains to be seen whether the government's plans will deliver on their promises or lead to further controversy and uncertainty in the criminal justice system.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Extreme pubic grooming 'may not cause sexually transmitted infections',"The results of a recent study conducted by researchers at the University College London (UCL) have challenged long-held beliefs about the link between extreme pubic grooming and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). According to the study, published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, there is no clear evidence that shaving or waxing the pubic area increases the risk of contracting an STI. The findings go against past research warning that shaving and waxing could leave cuts in the skin and help STIs to take hold. If left untreated, STIs can make getting pregnant more difficult or even impossible. However, the new study, which involved over 2,000 women, found no increased risk of STIs among those who regularly groomed their pubic hair. Lead researcher Dr. Anna Phillips, from UCL's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, said: ""Our findings suggest that there is no strong evidence for an association between pubic hair grooming and the risk of STIs in women. We cannot completely rule out a small increased risk, but it is likely to be small."" The study also looked at other factors that could influence the risk of contracting an STI, such as age, number of sexual partners, and use of contraception. The researchers found that younger women, those with more sexual partners, and those who did not use contraception were more likely to have an STI. Phillips added: ""It is important for women to be aware of their individual risk of STIs and take steps to protect themselves. This includes using condoms with new or casual partners, getting tested regularly, and practicing good hygiene."" The study is the largest of its kind, and the researchers hope that their findings will help to clarify the debate around pubic grooming and STIs. However, they caution that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the two. The findings have been welcomed by sexual health experts, who say that the focus should be on reducing the stigma around discussing STIs and promoting safer sex practices. Dr. Ranj Singh, a sexual health expert and TV doctor, said: ""It's important to remember that STIs can affect anyone, regardless of their grooming habits. The best way to prevent STIs is to practice safer sex, use protection, and get tested regularly."" The study also highlights the importance of good hygiene, regardless of whether or not someone chooses to groom their pubic hair. Dr. Amelia Lake, a sexual health expert from the University of Hull, said: ""Regularly washing the genital area with soap and water can help to reduce the risk of STIs and other infections. It's also important to avoid sharing towels or other personal items that could spread bacteria."" In conclusion, the new study challenges the widely held belief that extreme pubic grooming increases the risk of contracting STIs in women.

Coronavirus: Survey suggests business confidence at record low,"The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) survey, released on Monday, painted a grim picture of business confidence in Scotland amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest quarterly business sentiment survey, retail and construction sectors have been among the worst hit, with over 70% of firms in these industries reporting a decrease in turnover. The survey, which covered over 350 businesses across Scotland, revealed that 61% of respondents reported that their business was trading below normal levels, with over a third (36%) reporting that they had been forced to make redundancies or let staff go due to the impact of the pandemic. The hospitality sector also reported significant challenges, with 59% of firms in this industry reporting a decrease in turnover. The SCC warned that the sector, which employs over 110,000 people in Scotland, could face a long and difficult road to recovery. Commenting on the survey results, Susan Rae, Policy and External Relations Director at the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: ""These figures are a stark reminder of the challenges facing businesses across Scotland as a result of the pandemic. The sectors that have been hit hardest, such as retail, construction, and hospitality, are integral to our economy and we need to do everything we can to support them through this crisis."" The survey results come as Scotland prepares to move into a new phase of lockdown easing, with non-essential retail set to reopen on April 26. However, the SCC warned that many businesses, particularly those in the hospitality sector, would still face significant challenges due to social distancing measures and reduced capacity. The Scottish Government has announced a number of measures to support businesses during the pandemic, including grants, loans, and tax relief. However, the SCC has called for more support, particularly in the form of extended business rates relief and further financial assistance for businesses that have been forced to close entirely. Ms Rae added: ""The Scottish Government has provided some much-needed support for businesses during this crisis, but there is still more that can be done. We need to ensure that businesses have the resources they need to survive and recover from this pandemic. That means extending business rates relief, providing more financial assistance for those businesses that have been forced to close, and doing everything we can to support sectors that are facing particular challenges."" The SCC survey also highlighted the impact of the pandemic on business investment, with over 70% of firms reporting that they had either delayed or cancelled investment plans due to the crisis. The SCC warned that this could have long-term implications for Scotland's economy, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing and technology, which rely on investment to drive growth. Despite the challenges, there were some positive signs in the survey, with over 50% of firms reporting that they were planning to hire new staff in the next 12 months.

Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty,"David Martin, the MEP (Member of European Parliament) responsible for the report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), said the treaty threatened civil liberties. His comments came less than a week after the European Commission signed the agreement on behalf of the EU. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Martin expressed deep concern over the potential impact of ACTA on citizens' fundamental rights. He argued that the treaty, which aims to enforce intellectual property rights, could lead to widespread surveillance and infringement of privacy. ""The European Parliament has always been clear that any measures to combat counterfeiting and piracy must be balanced against the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights,"" Martin said. ""Unfortunately, ACTA fails this test."" Martin pointed to several provisions in the treaty that could be used to justify intrusive surveillance and data collection. For example, Article 2(c) of ACTA defines 'counterfeit goods' to include not only physical products but also digital content. This could give governments the power to monitor online activity and interfere with privacy in the name of protecting intellectual property. Furthermore, Martin argued that ACTA could lead to the criminalization of individuals who unintentionally infringe on intellectual property rights. He cited the example of someone sharing a song on peer-to-peer networks, unaware that it was a copyrighted work. Such individuals could face criminal charges and fines under ACTA. Martin's comments were welcomed by civil liberties groups, who have long criticized ACTA as a threat to privacy and free speech. The European Digital Rights (EDRi) coalition, which represents over 30 civil society organizations, called on EU governments to reject the treaty and start a new, open and transparent process for protecting intellectual property. ""ACTA is a dangerous agreement that threatens fundamental rights and undermines the democratic process,"" said Joe McNamee, EDRi's executive director. ""The European Parliament should not allow this to happen."" The European Commission, however, defended the treaty and dismissed the concerns raised by Martin and other critics. A spokesperson for the Commission argued that ACTA was necessary to combat the growing problem of counterfeit goods and protect consumers from unsafe products. The next step in the process is for ACTA to be ratified by individual EU member states before it can come into force. Several countries, including the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, have already expressed reservations about the treaty and may not ratify it. It remains to be seen whether other countries will follow suit and whether the EU will listen to the concerns raised by Martin and other critics. In the meantime, the debate over ACTA is likely to continue, with both sides making their case for and against the treaty. One thing is clear, however: the controversy over ACTA is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Nuisance calls out of control, says taskforce","The taskforce on tackling nuisance calls has released a new report, expressing deep concern over the escalating issue of unwanted phone calls and the impact they are having on consumers. The group, which includes representatives from Ofcom, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), has called for urgent action from regulators and businesses to bring an end to this persistent problem. One of the key recommendations from the report is that the threshold at which regulators intervene in cases of nuisance calls should be lowered. This would enable more effective enforcement against companies making unwanted calls, and could help to deter businesses from engaging in such practices in the first place. The taskforce also wants company directors to be held responsible for unwanted phone calls from their businesses. This could include fines for individuals as well as companies, sending a strong message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. The report states that ""directors have a duty to ensure that their organisations comply with relevant laws and regulations, and should be held accountable if they fail to do so."" Another proposed solution is to increase transparency around the use of telephone numbers. The taskforce suggests that companies should be required to publish their call centre numbers online, making it easier for consumers to identify and report unwanted calls. Additionally, there is a call for the use of dedicated, identifiable numbers for marketing calls, to help reduce the number of unsolicited calls that consumers receive. Furthermore, the report highlights the importance of education and awareness in tackling nuisance calls. Consumers should be made more aware of their rights when it comes to unsolicited calls, and should be provided with clear information on how to report and block unwanted calls. The taskforce also calls for more to be done to educate businesses about the impact of nuisance calls on consumers, and the legal and reputational risks they face when engaging in such practices. The report comes as the number of nuisance calls continues to rise, with an estimated 30 million nuisance calls made every month in the UK. Not only are these calls a major inconvenience for consumers, but they can also be distressing and costly, with some people being charged for calls they did not make. The taskforce has urged all stakeholders to take immediate action to address this issue and bring an end to the misery caused by nuisance calls. In conclusion, the taskforce's report sends a clear message that the issue of nuisance calls is one that requires urgent attention. The recommendations, which include lowering the threshold for regulatory intervention, holding directors accountable, increasing transparency around the use of telephone numbers, and educating consumers and businesses, offer a comprehensive approach to tackling this persistent problem. It is now up to regulators, businesses, and individuals to take action and bring an end to the scourge of nuisance calls.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Intensive care demand surged at peak of crisis,"An official report on Covid-19 cases requiring intensive care has shed light on the peak of the crisis in hospitals. The data reveals that the demand for intensive care units (ICUs) reached a surge on 29 March, with a total of 29 patients admitted in a single day. This number was a stark reminder of the immense pressure the healthcare system was facing during the pandemic's first wave. Admissions remained close to this level for about one week, with an average of 25 patients being admitted daily. This period marked the most challenging time for hospitals, as they struggled to cope with the influx of critically ill patients. The ICUs were filled to capacity, and healthcare workers were working around the clock to save lives. The report also highlights the demographic trends of those requiring ICU care. Older adults, particularly those with underlying health conditions, were the most likely to be admitted. The data shows that 80% of ICU patients were over the age of 60, and 60% had at least one pre-existing condition. The data also reveals that the majority of ICU admissions were due to respiratory failure, which is a common complication of Covid-19. The virus attacks the lungs, making it difficult for patients to breathe. In severe cases, mechanical ventilation is necessary to keep the patient alive. The high demand for ICU beds during the peak of the crisis led to difficult decisions for healthcare professionals. In some cases, resources had to be allocated based on the likelihood of survival rather than age or other factors. The ethical dilemmas that arose during this time were a source of great distress for healthcare workers and ethicists alike. The report also highlights the importance of vaccination in preventing the need for ICU care. The data shows that since the rollout of the vaccination programme, the number of Covid-19 patients requiring ICU care has significantly decreased. The vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and death from Covid-19. The official report serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that the healthcare system faced during the peak of the Covid-19 crisis. It highlights the importance of vaccination in preventing the need for ICU care and reducing the strain on the healthcare system. The report also underscores the need for continued vigilance and preparedness in the face of future waves or new variants of the virus.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Oxford top of global university rankings,"By Sean Coughlan, BBC News family and education correspondent The annual Times Higher Education world rankings have once again placed the University of Oxford at the top, reinforcing its position as the world's leading university. But there is a warning from the organisation behind the rankings that the league table may not be as accurate as it once was, due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The 15th edition of the World University Rankings, which evaluates more than 1,400 universities across 93 countries, uses 13 performance indicators to assess teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. However, the pandemic has made it more challenging to collect and analyse the data, particularly in areas such as research productivity and international outlook, which rely on metrics like the number of international students and staff. ""The data challenges we faced this year were unprecedented,"" said Phil Baty, chief knowledge officer at Times Higher Education. ""With travel restrictions and campus closures, we have had to get creative to ensure we capture as much data as possible."" Despite the challenges, Oxford maintained its position at the top, with the University of Cambridge in third place and Imperial College London in tenth. The US remains the most represented country in the rankings, with 366 universities featured, while China sees the most growth with 128 universities featured - up from 110 last year. The UK is home to 125 institutions in the table, with the University of Edinburgh and University College London (UCL) in fourth and fifth place respectively. Other notable performers include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in second place and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) in sixth. The rankings also highlight the importance of research in the university league table, with the University of Oxford and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) sharing first place for research reputation. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Baty remains optimistic about the future of the rankings. ""We are committed to making the World University Rankings as robust and reliable as possible, using the data we have available to us,"" he said. ""We will continue to work with universities and governments around the world to ensure that the rankings continue to provide valuable insights into the global higher education landscape."" In the meantime, universities will continue to focus on adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic, with many investing in online learning, virtual research collaborations and digital innovation. As the world begins to emerge from the pandemic, the role of universities in driving economic growth and innovation is more critical than ever. And the World University Rankings will continue to play a vital role in highlighting the institutions that are leading the way.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Israeli 'Freedom is basic' niqab advert criticised,"By George Pierpoint, BBC News and Osob Elmi, BBC News The ad, for clothing brand Hoodies, opens with a caption reading ""Is Iran here?"" and shows Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli wearing a niqab, the full-face veil worn by some Muslim women. The background is a bustling Middle Eastern market. Refaeli's face is obscured, leaving only her eyes visible. The 30-second spot, produced by an Israeli advertising agency, has sparked controversy both in Israel and abroad. Critics argue that it trivialises the niqab, which is a deeply religious and cultural symbol for many Muslim women, and that it perpetuates negative stereotypes about the Middle East. ""This ad is not only offensive, it's dangerous,"" said Amir Ahmadian, the executive director of the American-Israeli Council for Public Affairs. ""It plays into the worst kind of Orientalist fantasies and reinforces harmful stereotypes about Muslims and the Middle East. It's not just disrespectful to Muslim women, it's disrespectful to all of us."" The Israeli Advertising Association, which represents the industry, has distanced itself from the campaign, saying that it does not reflect the views of the industry as a whole. ""The ad in question is the responsibility of the advertising agency and the client,"" the association said in a statement. ""We do not condone any form of discrimination or insensitivity towards any community."" The controversy comes at a time when tensions between Israel and its Muslim neighbours are running high. Recent weeks have seen renewed violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem. The advertising campaign has been seen by some as adding fuel to the fire. ""This ad is not just about fashion, it's about politics,"" said Noura Erakat, a legal scholar and human rights activist. ""It's part of a larger narrative that seeks to demonise and delegitimise Muslims and the Arab world. It's part of a larger campaign to erase our presence and our dignity."" The clothing brand Hoodies has not responded to requests for comment. But in a statement on its website, the company defended the ad, saying that it was meant to be ""edgy and provocative"". ""Freedom is a fundamental human right, and we believe that everyone should be free to express themselves as they see fit,"" the statement read. ""We do not intend to offend or hurt anyone, but we do believe in pushing boundaries and challenging conventions."" But for many, the ad goes beyond a simple challenge to convention. It is seen as a dangerous and disrespectful appropriation of a deeply religious and cultural symbol. And in a region where tensions are already high, it is likely to fuel further division and misunderstanding.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
SNP conference: Sturgeon pledges childcare 'revolution',"The new SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, unveiled ambitious plans for a childcare revolution at the party's conference in Perth on Saturday. The First Minister of Scotland pledged to increase the number of free hours for young children from the current 16 to 30 hours per week. Addressing the SNP conference, Sturgeon emphasized the importance of early years education in ensuring a better future for Scotland's children. She stated that the current 16 hours of free childcare was not enough, and that the proposed expansion would help more families balance work and family life. ""We know that the early years are the most important in a child's development,"" Sturgeon said. ""We want to make sure that every child in Scotland has the best possible start in life. And that means ensuring that their parents have the support they need to provide for their families and to be there for their children."" The SNP's childcare proposals would benefit around 80,000 families in Scotland, according to estimates. The plan would be funded through a combination of existing budgets and new revenue raised through policies like a tax on empty homes. The SNP's conference comes at a time when childcare is a major issue for many families across Scotland and the UK. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of affordable and accessible childcare, particularly for key workers who need to go to work. Sturgeon's announcement was welcomed by many in the SNP and beyond. Scottish Labour's shadow education secretary, Iain Gray, praised the proposal as a ""significant step forward"" in early years education. ""The Scottish Government's expansion of free childcare hours is a significant step forward for children and families,"" Gray said. ""It will make a real difference to working families across Scotland, particularly those on low incomes."" The Scottish Greens also expressed support for the SNP's plans, with co-leader Lorna Slater describing it as a ""much-needed investment in our children's futures."" Sturgeon's childcare announcement is just one of a number of policies being discussed at the SNP conference. The party is also expected to debate issues like climate change, education, and health care. As the SNP conference continues, it is clear that childcare will be a major focus for the Scottish Government over the coming months and years. Sturgeon's ambitious plans for a childcare revolution are sure to be a topic of conversation in Scottish politics for some time to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
At what age do you feel you have reached adulthood?,"Nationwide's study of 2,000 over-18s revealed some interesting insights into the age at which people feel they have reached adulthood. The research showed that more than one in 10 respondents did not consider themselves as fully fledged grown-ups until they had reached the age of 27. One of those people is Lisa Daisy, a 34-year-old marketing executive from Manchester. Lisa shared her experience with the BBC, explaining that despite having a successful career, getting married, and buying a house, she still felt like she was ""winging it"" in many areas of her life. ""Even after a career, two degrees, a husband, and a house, I still don't feel like an adult,"" Lisa admitted. ""I think there's a perception that once you reach a certain age or achieve certain milestones, you're supposed to have it all figured out. But the truth is, nobody really does."" Lisa's feelings were echoed by other participants in the study. For some, the lack of a clear sense of adulthood was down to financial pressures. Twenty-nine-year-old James, from London, explained that he felt like he was constantly playing catch-up with his finances and couldn't afford to take the risks that came with feeling like a grown-up. ""I've got a good job, but my student loans are only just starting to be paid off, and I'm still renting,"" James said. ""I feel like I'm always one paycheque away from disaster, so I can't really afford to think about the future or make long-term plans."" Others pointed to relationship issues, with 31-year-old Sarah from Birmingham revealing that she felt like she was ""still trying to figure out what I want in a partner and in a relationship"". Sarah explained that she had been in a series of short-term relationships and was now taking a break from dating to focus on her career and personal growth. Despite these challenges, there were also positive stories in the study. Thirty-nine-year-old Tom, from Edinburgh, felt that he had finally reached a sense of stability and maturity in his life. A father of two and a homeowner, Tom explained that he felt a sense of pride in providing for his family and was looking forward to the future. ""I used to feel like I was drifting through life, not really knowing where I was going,"" Tom said. ""But now that I've got a stable job, a family, and a home, I feel like I've finally grown up. I've still got challenges to face, but I feel like I've got the tools to deal with them."" In conclusion, the Nationwide study highlights the complex and often uncertain nature of adulthood.

Shoreham air crash pilot 'flew too low' at Southport airshow,"Southport Airshow expressed its deepest condolences following the tragic Shoreham air crash that occurred during the event last weekend. The Jet Provost T5, which the BBC has established was piloted by Mr. Hill, was seen too close to crowds and below the height set for the flying display, leading to the unfortunate incident. The Airshow organizers stated that Mr. Hill, an experienced pilot with over 4,000 flying hours, had been cleared to perform a low-level flypast during the event. However, he reportedly deviated from the approved flight path and flew too close to the spectators and at a lower altitude than permitted. Witnesses described seeing the aircraft performing a loop-the-loop maneuver before suddenly diving towards the ground. The plane crashed into the A27 road, causing significant damage and tragedy as it struck a car, resulting in the death of 11 people and injuring dozens more. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has launched an investigation into the incident to determine the cause of the accident. Preliminary reports suggest that a possible engine failure may have contributed to the crash, but this is still under investigation. Mr. Hill's family released a statement expressing their shock and sadness at the loss of their loved one. They asked for privacy during this difficult time and expressed their sympathy for the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured in the incident. The Southport Airshow has been suspended indefinitely following the tragedy, and organizers have expressed their commitment to fully cooperating with the AAIB investigation and implementing any necessary changes to ensure the safety of spectators in the future. The Shoreham air crash has left the aviation community in mourning, with many expressing their shock and sadness at the loss of life and the tragic circumstances surrounding the incident. The flying community is a close-knit one, and the loss of a fellow pilot is felt deeply. The AAIB investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and in the meantime, the aviation community will continue to remember those who lost their lives in the tragedy and honor their memory by working to ensure that such an incident never happens again. The Shoreham air crash serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in aviation and the importance of adhering to safety protocols and regulations. The flying community will continue to work together to ensure that the skies remain safe for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Italy's Giuseppe Conte tells populist leaders: 'Stop fighting or I'll quit',"Mr Conte's stern warning came amidst growing tensions within Italy's fractious year-old coalition of the League and the Five Star Movement (M5S). The Prime Minister, who hails from the M5S, made the statement during a heated meeting with leaders from both parties, urging them to put aside their differences and focus on governing. In recent weeks, the coalition has been plagued by internal disputes over various policy issues, with the League pushing for a more hardline stance on immigration and fiscal policy, while the M5S has advocated for a more centrist approach. These differences have led to a series of high-profile resignations, including that of Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the League's leader and Mr Conte's closest ally. Mr Conte acknowledged the challenges facing the coalition but made it clear that he was unwilling to tolerate further infighting. ""We have a duty to the Italian people to govern effectively,"" he said. ""If we cannot do so, then I will simply end my mandate."" The Prime Minister's words were met with a mixture of shock and defiance from both sides of the coalition. League leader Matteo Salvini, who has been pushing for new elections, claimed that Mr Conte's statement was a ploy to shore up support among his own party. ""The people of Italy want new elections, and that's what we'll give them,"" he declared. Meanwhile, M5S leader Vito Crimi called on Mr Conte to take a more conciliatory approach and to engage in dialogue with his coalition partners. ""We are all in this together,"" he said. ""We must find a way to work together for the good of the Italian people."" The developments in Italy come at a critical time for the European Union, which has been grappling with a series of political crises in recent months. The uncertainty surrounding the coalition's future has raised concerns among EU leaders about the stability of the Italian economy and the potential for further instability in the eurozone. Mr Conte's statement was seen by some as a bid to stem the tide of political instability and to demonstrate his commitment to governing. However, the deep divisions within the coalition suggest that the challenges facing Italy's political landscape are far from over. As the situation unfolds, observers will be closely watching developments in Rome to see whether Mr Conte's call for unity will be heeded or if the coalition will continue to be torn apart by internal divisions. One thing is clear: the fate of Italy's government and its relations with the EU hang in the balance.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Conservation: Bid to save reptiles and amphibians in Wales,"By Matt Lloyd, BBC Wales More than 50% of snake, newt, and toad species are under threat globally, conservationists have warned. In Wales, efforts are being made to combat this trend and protect these vital creatures. Housing and road construction are two major threats to the survival of reptiles and amphibians in Wales. The rapid expansion of housing developments and the increase in traffic have resulted in the fragmentation of habitats, making it difficult for these animals to thrive. Newts, for example, require specific conditions to breed, such as ponds with no fish, which are increasingly rare in the face of development. Toads, on the other hand, often struggle to cross roads, leading to high mortality rates. Snakes, including the rare adder, face challenges from habitat destruction and persecution. Despite being a protected species, adders are still sometimes killed or collected as souvenirs. The ""terrible public image"" of reptiles and amphibians is also a concern. Many people view them as pests or unwanted intruders, leading to their persecution or mistreatment. However, there are signs of hope. Several organisations in Wales are working to protect these animals and raise awareness of their importance. One such organisation is the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust (ARC). They have been working to protect and conserve amphibians and reptiles in Wales for over 30 years. ARC has several ongoing projects, including the monitoring of newt populations in ponds, the creation of road crossing structures to help toads and other amphibians, and the protection of rare reptile populations. Another organisation making a difference is Natural Resources Wales (NRW). They are responsible for managing the natural resources of Wales and have a dedicated team working on reptile and amphibian conservation. NRW's team works closely with developers to ensure that habitats are protected during construction projects. They also provide advice and guidance to landowners on how to manage their land to benefit these animals. One example of their work is the management of the Garw Valley Newt Project. This project involves the restoration of ponds and the creation of new ones to provide suitable breeding sites for newts. These efforts are starting to pay off. In 2020, a rare great crested newt was found in a pond near Merthyr Tydfil, marking the first record of this species in the area for over 30 years. Despite the challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of reptiles and amphibians in Wales. Conservationists are working tirelessly to protect these animals and raise awareness of their role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. As the world continues to face threats to its wildlife, the efforts of organisations like ARC and NRW are",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Honour of Kings: China's most vilified online game,"By Timothy McDonald, Business Reporter, BBC News Access to Honour of Kings, China's most vilified online game, is now restricted to one hour a day for children aged between 6 and 18. The new rules, which came into effect on 1 February, are part of the Chinese government's efforts to curb addiction and protect young people from the negative effects of gaming. The move follows a series of high-profile incidents involving children who reportedly became addicted to the game, neglecting their studies and health. Honour of Kings, developed by Tencent Holdings, is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game with over 200 million users in China alone. It has been criticised for its addictive nature and violent content, which some argue is inappropriate for young audiences. The Chinese government's cyberspace administration announced the new rules in December 2020, stating that they were necessary to ""maintain the healthy growth of children."" The restrictions apply to both the game's mobile and PC versions. Under the new rules, parents will also be required to verify their children's identity and account information before they can play. They will also be notified if their child exceeds the one-hour daily limit, and can set up a password to prevent their child from accessing the game outside of designated hours. Tencent has welcomed the new rules, stating that they will help to ensure that young users ""enjoy healthy and balanced growth."" The company has also pledged to take further steps to promote responsible gaming and protect young users, including increasing the age restriction for certain in-game purchases. However, some critics have expressed concern that the new rules may not go far enough. They argue that the game's addictive nature and violent content are inherent to its design, and that more fundamental changes are needed to ensure that young people are not harmed by their use of the game. Others have argued that the new rules represent an overreach by the Chinese government, and that they may infringe on parents' rights to make decisions about how their children spend their time. Some have also expressed concern that the new rules may drive young people to seek out alternative, and potentially more dangerous, forms of entertainment. Despite these concerns, the new rules have been widely welcomed by many parents and educators in China, who see them as an important step in addressing the issue of online gaming addiction among young people. The controversy surrounding Honour of Kings is not unique to China. Similar concerns have been raised in other countries around the world, including the United States, where there have been calls for greater regulation of online gaming and its impact on young people. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the impact of video games on young people is a complex and multifaceted issue, and one that requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach.

"Cambridge homeless man Raymond Boyle's killer, 18, jailed","Jack Robinson, an 18-year-old man from Cambridge, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 13 years for the brutal murder of 53-year-old Raymond Boyle. The incident occurred last June in Jesus Green, a popular park located near the heart of the historic university city. According to the prosecution, Robinson approached Boyle, who was sitting on a bench, and without provocation, stamped on his head and back repeatedly with such force that Boyle was knocked unconscious. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic and distressing, with Boyle's cries for help echoing through the park. Robinson then callously dragged the helpless man to the River Cam, where his lifeless body was later discovered. The water had risen significantly due to recent heavy rainfall, and Boyle's body was submerged in the murky waters for several hours before being found. The investigation into Boyle's murder was a lengthy and complex one, with the police conducting numerous inquiries and interviews in an attempt to piece together the events leading up to the tragedy. CCTV footage from the park provided crucial evidence, showing Robinson leaving the scene of the crime with haste and a sense of urgency. At his trial, Robinson's defense argued that he had acted in self-defense, claiming that Boyle had approached him with an aggressive demeanor and threatening words. However, the prosecution presented evidence of Robinson's previous violent behavior, including an assault on another man just weeks before the murder. The jury took just three hours to deliver a unanimous guilty verdict, bringing a measure of closure to Boyle's family and friends. In a statement read to the court, they paid tribute to their beloved brother and father, describing him as a kind and gentle man who had been taken from them in the most cruel and senseless of ways. Detective Inspector Mark Long, who led the investigation, paid tribute to the bravery of the witnesses who came forward and provided crucial evidence in the case. He also urged anyone who may have information about incidents of violence or crime to report it to the police, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. The sentencing of Jack Robinson marks the end of a difficult and harrowing chapter in the lives of the Boyle family and the wider Cambridge community. The brutal and senseless nature of the crime has shocked and saddened many, and serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy, kindness, and respect for all members of society, regardless of their circumstances. The trial and sentencing have also highlighted the ongoing issue of homelessness in Cambridge and the need for continued support and resources to help those in need.

MP Yeo cleared by standards watchdog,"The Tory MP, Yeo, found himself at the center of a controversy this week after being secretly filmed by investigators from The Sunday Times. The paper alleged that Yeo had admitted to coaching a business associate on what to say during a meeting, which was arranged under false pretenses. The meeting in question took place in December 2020, with Yeo believing he was meeting representatives of a fictional energy company seeking to hire his services. However, unbeknownst to him, the individuals were, in fact, undercover investigators from The Sunday Times. During the meeting, Yeo reportedly made a series of claims about his ability to influence government policy and his access to influential figures within the Conservative Party. He also allegedly suggested that he could help the fictional company secure lucrative contracts and grants. Following the publication of the story, Yeo was referred to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for further investigation. The Commissioner's office confirmed to BBC News that an investigation was underway, but would not comment further due to the ongoing nature of the case. Despite the allegations, Yeo maintains that he did nothing wrong and that he believed he was meeting with genuine business representatives. He also insists that he did not discuss any specific contracts or grants with the individuals. However, The Sunday Times has released footage of the meeting, which appears to show Yeo making the controversial comments. The paper also claims to have spoken to several witnesses who were present during the meeting and who have corroborated the allegations. If found in breach of the House of Commons Code of Conduct, Yeo could face a range of sanctions, from a formal reprimand to being suspended or even expelled from the House of Commons. This is not the first time that Yeo has been involved in a controversy. In 2018, he was criticized for his comments about the Windrush generation, which some saw as insensitive and dismissive. He also faced calls to resign over his association with the now-defunct consultancy firm, 157 Ventures, which was at the center of a lobbying scandal. Despite these past controversies, Yeo remains a prominent figure within the Conservative Party. He was re-elected as the MP for South Downing Street in December 2019, and is currently a member of several influential committees. The ongoing investigation is likely to cast a shadow over Yeo's political career, and could potentially damage the reputation of the Conservative Party as a whole. However, only time will tell whether the allegations will stick, or whether Yeo will be cleared of any wrongdoing. In the meantime, the Opposition parties have called for Yeo to be suspended from his parliamentary duties while the investigation is ongoing.

Indian media: Kashmir government,"The state of Jammu and Kashmir gave a ""fractured mandate"" on 23 December after a fiercely fought election. No single party was able to cross the 44-seat mark needed for a clear majority in the 87-seat state assembly. The complex web of alliances and coalitions that emerged from the polls has left the media in a state of flux, with many questions about how the government will be formed and what it will mean for the region. The largest party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), secured only 28 seats, just short of the majority mark. They have indicated that they will explore the possibility of forming a coalition government with other parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won 25 seats, has also staked a claim to form the government, though it appears that they will fall short of the majority mark as well. The uncertainty surrounding the formation of the government has led to a flurry of activity in the Indian media. Speculation about potential alliances and coalitions has dominated news coverage, with analysts and pundits offering their assessments of the various possibilities. Some have suggested that a grand coalition between the PDP and the BJP could be a viable option, given the historical ties between the two parties. Others have argued that such a coalition would be risky, given the ideological differences between the two parties on issues like autonomy and security. Meanwhile, the Kashmiri media has been focusing on the impact of the election results on the ground. Many have expressed concern about the potential for instability and unrest in the region, given the deep-rooted political and social tensions that exist. Others have pointed to the need for a stable and effective government, in order to address the many challenges facing the state, including poverty, unemployment, and the ongoing insurgency. The Kashmiri media has also been critical of the Indian media's coverage of the election and its aftermath. They have accused some outlets of sensationalism and of promoting a biased and one-sided view of events. There have been reports of harassment and intimidation of journalists by political parties and other groups, adding to the sense of unease and uncertainty in the region. As the political landscape in Jammu and Kashmir continues to evolve, the media will play a crucial role in reporting and analyzing developments.

Proud Boys: Far-right group becomes LGBT trend online,"The trend of appropriating the name and symbols of the far-right, anti-immigrant group Proud Boys online by members of the LGBTQ+ community has gained significant traction in recent times. This development is part of efforts to drown out posts and content related to the real Proud Boys group, which has been linked to numerous hate crimes and violent incidents. Actors, artists, and even members of the Canadian armed forces have jumped on the bandwagon, using the Proud Boys name in a playful and satirical manner to challenge the group's toxic narrative. This trend has been particularly prevalent on social media platforms such as TikTok and Twitter, where users have taken to creating humorous and ironic content under the Proud Boys moniker. One such example is a TikTok video created by a user named @queer.proud.boys, which has garnered over 4 million views. In the video, the user dons a Make America Gay Again hat and proudly declares, ""I'm a proud boy, and I'm here to make America gay again!"" The video is accompanied by upbeat music and features the user dancing and lip-syncing to popular songs. Another user, @proud.girls.matter, has created a series of videos showcasing lesbian, gay, and transgender women embracing the Proud Boys label in a positive and empowering way. The videos have received thousands of likes and comments, with users expressing their support for the movement. Even members of the Canadian armed forces have joined in on the trend, with some creating memes and sharing posts that poke fun at the Proud Boys group. One such post, which has since been deleted, featured a photo of a group of soldiers wearing Proud Boys-style hats and holding rainbow flags. The trend of appropriating the Proud Boys name is an effective way of disrupting the group's online presence and challenging their hateful rhetoric. By reclaiming the term and using it in a positive and inclusive manner, the LGBTQ+ community is able to turn the tables on the far-right group and highlight their intolerance and bigotry for what it truly is. However, it is important to note that this trend should not be taken lightly, and the seriousness of the real Proud Boys group should not be downplayed. The group's actions have led to real harm and violence, and it is essential that efforts are made to counter their hateful ideology and prevent them from gaining any more power or influence. In conclusion, the trend of appropriating the Proud Boys name by members of the LGBTQ+ community is a powerful and effective way of challenging the far-right group's online presence and disrupting their hateful narrative. However, it is essential that this trend is not taken lightly and that efforts are made to counter the real Proud Boys group's harmful actions and ide",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Birmingham bin strike: Council 'backtracking on deal',"Unite, the trade union representing Birmingham bin workers, accused the city council of backtracking on a deal that was supposed to end the long-standing bin strike. The union claimed that the council was sending out refuse trucks without ""leading hands,"" who operate at the back of the vehicles and are essential for the efficient and safe collection of waste. The union's representative, Jerry Blackledge, stated, ""We've been informed that the council intends to operate trucks without leading hands. This is a clear breach of the agreement we had reached. It's a critical issue at the heart of this dispute."" The bin strike, which began in January 2022, has caused significant disruption to waste collection services in Birmingham. The council and Unite had been in negotiations to resolve the dispute, which centers around pay, terms, and conditions. According to the union, the council had agreed to reinstate leading hands, who were previously removed in an attempt to cut costs. However, the council denied this allegation, stating that they had only agreed to a review of the role. The council's spokesperson, Michael Chilton, said, ""The council strongly refutes any suggestion that we have backtracked on our commitment to resolve this dispute. We have made it clear that we are willing to engage in meaningful negotiations with Unite, but we cannot accept demands that would be financially unsustainable for the council."" The union, however, argued that the council's refusal to reinstate leading hands was a non-starter. Blackledge stated, ""The removal of leading hands was a major cause of this dispute. We can't accept an agreement that doesn't address this issue."" The ongoing dispute has led to a backlog of waste, with some areas seeing their bins not emptied for weeks. Residents have expressed their frustration and concern over the situation, with some reporting vermin infestations and health issues. The union has called for a fresh wave of industrial action in response to the council's stance. Blackledge warned, ""If the council continues to refuse to address the core issues of this dispute, then we will have no choice but to escalate our action."" The situation is a complex one, with both the council and the union dug in their heels. The impact on Birmingham's residents continues to be felt, and a resolution to the dispute is urgently needed.

Council demanded payment card details via email,"By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor Islington Council had requested residents to share the security code from the rear of their payment cards, as well as their address and other personal details via email. One security expert has described this move as ""extremely concerning."" The local authority in London sent the email to a number of residents earlier this week, asking them to provide the sensitive information to allow for a ""quick and easy"" set-up of a new online account for council tax payments. The email, which was reportedly sent from a generic council address, did include a link to the council's official website. However, the request for card security codes raised eyebrows among cybersecurity professionals. The code, which is the three-digit number found on the signature strip on the back of a credit or debit card, is a crucial part of the card's security system. Sharing it with an unverified recipient could potentially put vulnerable individuals at risk of identity theft or fraud. Dr. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, commented, ""If it was genuinely from the council, they would not be asking for payment card details by email. They would have a secure system where you can update your details online, and they would not be asking for card security codes."" Anderson added that the council should be using secure methods to verify residents' identities, such as calling them to confirm their details or sending a letter through the post. Islington Council has since apologised for the error, stating that it was a result of an ""administrative mistake"" and that the email was not an official request for payment card details. The council added that it would be contacting those affected to offer advice on how to protect themselves from potential fraud. It is a reminder for everyone to be vigilant when dealing with unsolicited emails and requests for sensitive information. The National Cyber Security Centre advises that people should avoid sharing payment card details via email, and instead contact the organisation directly using a trusted phone number or website to verify the request's legitimacy. This incident serves as a timely reminder for all local authorities to be mindful of the potential risks and to follow best practices when dealing with residents' personal data. It is crucial that they prioritise security and communicate clearly to avoid any confusion or potential harm to their constituents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New Zealand's Dunedin jokes about losing 'steepest street' title,"For years, Dunedin's Baldwin Street proudly held the title of the world's steepest residential street, and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as a testament to its achievement. But on Tuesday, the accolade went to a new contender, leaving the proud New Zealand city grappling with a sense of loss. The steepness of Baldwin Street has long been a source of pride for Dunedin residents and tourists alike. With an average gradient of 1 in 2.86, the street has been a fascinating attraction, drawing visitors from around the world to challenge themselves as they ascended its steep incline. The street's unique character has even earned it a place in popular culture, becoming the subject of countless jokes and memes. However, on Tuesday, the title of the world's steepest residential street was officially handed over to a street in Switzerland, named Landsdorfer Strasse, which boasts an average gradient of 1 in 2.45. The news came as a shock to many in Dunedin, who had grown used to the recognition and kudos that came with holding the record. The loss of the title has sparked a wave of humor and self-deprecation in the city. Jokes about Baldwin Street's new status as the ""second steepest"" have been making the rounds, with some even suggesting that the city might consider renaming the street to reflect its new position. Others have suggested that Dunedin could focus on other unique attractions, such as its stunning beaches or its rich heritage, to keep tourists coming. Despite the jokes and light-hearted banter, there is a sense of disappointment among some in the city. The loss of the record feels like a small defeat, a reminder that even the most cherished achievements can be taken away. However, there is also a sense of resilience and determination. Baldwin Street may no longer be the world's steepest, but it remains a unique and fascinating attraction, and a symbol of Dunedin's character and spirit. As the city adjusts to its new reality, there is a sense that the loss of the title is an opportunity to reframe the conversation about Baldwin Street and the city as a whole. Rather than focusing on the record, attention can be turned to the experiences and memories that Baldwin Street provides, and the role it plays in the wider community. In the end, while the title of the world's steepest residential street may have been taken away, the spirit and character of Baldwin Street and Dunedin remain undiminished.

Cour du Parc renovation to begin in September,"Cour du Parc at La Charroterie in St Peter Port, a once vibrant and much-loved residential building, has been conspicuously empty since 2011. The decision to evacuate the premises came after a thorough assessment revealed that the building was no longer fit to house residents due to its deteriorating condition. The announcement was met with great disappointment from the community, as the Cour du Parc had long been a cherished part of St Peter Port's rich heritage. However, the situation is set to change, as the association responsible for the building's management has recently announced that a long-awaited renovation project is due to begin in September. The association plans to increase the existing 42 residential units by adding an additional 10, creating a total of 52 apartments upon completion of the renovation. This substantial investment in the future of Cour du Parc is a testament to the commitment of the association to preserving the historical charm of the building while bringing it up to modern standards. The project will not only breathe new life into the building but also provide much-needed affordable housing in the heart of St Peter Port. The renovation will involve extensive works, including the replacement of all electrical and plumbing systems, the installation of new insulation, and the restoration of the building's original features. The exterior will also be repaired and repainted, returning it to its former glory. The interior of each apartment will be fully modernized, with new kitchens, bathrooms, and flooring. The project's timing could not be better, as the demand for affordable housing in Guernsey has reached an all-time high. The island's population has continued to grow, putting pressure on existing housing stocks and driving up prices. The renovation of Cour du Parc will not only provide much-needed accommodation but also offer a unique opportunity for those looking to live in the heart of St Peter Port. The association has also announced that it will be offering priority access to the new apartments to those who have previously resided in the building. This gesture is aimed at recognizing the loyalty and commitment of the former residents and ensuring that they have first dibs on the newly created units. The renovation project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, and residents are eagerly anticipating their return to their beloved Cour du Parc. The association's commitment to preserving the building's history while modernizing its facilities is a welcome development for all involved, and the community looks forward to welcoming back the vibrant and diverse community that once called Cour du Parc home.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tate Britain hits Â£45m renovation target,"Nine of the building's gallery rooms are being refurbished, as are the entrance area and other public spaces at Tate Britain. The target of Â£45 million for this extensive renovation project has been reached, thanks to the generous support of various donors and the National Lottery. The transformation of Tate Britain, which first opened its doors in 1897, is an ambitious project aimed at enhancing the visitor experience and preserving the historic building for future generations. The refurbishment includes the creation of new galleries, improved accessibility, and the restoration of original features that have been hidden for decades. The renovation of the gallery rooms will enable the institution to showcase its extensive collection more effectively. These spaces will be adapted to suit specific artworks, creating a more immersive experience for visitors. The entrance area and public spaces will undergo a similar transformation, providing a warm and inviting welcome to the museum, and offering comfortable spaces for visitors to relax and socialize. One of the most significant aspects of the renovation project is the restoration of the original features of the building. Hidden for many years, these details will be revealed, offering visitors a glimpse into the history of the institution. For example, the ornate plasterwork in the Entrance Hall and the intricate mosaic flooring in the Central Hall will be restored to their former glory. The creation of new galleries will also be a key element of the renovation. These galleries will provide space for the museum to display its extensive collection, which includes works by renowned artists such as J.M.W. Turner, William Blake, and Henry Moore. The new galleries will be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing the museum to experiment with different displays and themes. Improved accessibility is another important aspect of the renovation project. The museum is committed to making its collection accessible to as many people as possible, and the refurbishment will include the installation of lift facilities and improved wheelchair access. Additionally, the museum will offer audio guides in multiple languages, ensuring that visitors from all around the world can enjoy the collection. The renovation project is being carried out in phases, with the first phase focusing on the redevelopment of the Duveen Galleries. These galleries, which were originally built in 1924, will be transformed into a flexible space suitable for displaying large-scale installations and temporary exhibitions. The second phase of the project, which will focus on the refurbishment of the gallery rooms and public spaces, is due to begin in 2023. The renovation of Tate Britain is an exciting development for the museum and for the art world as a whole. It will enable the museum to showcase its collection in a more effective and engaging way, and will offer visitors a more enjoyable and accessible experience.

Tropical forests 'better managed',"By Richard Black, Environment correspondent, BBC News The area under some form of sustainable management plan in the world's tropical forests increased by about 50% over the past decade, according to new analysis. This growth in managed forest areas was driven largely by countries in Asia and South America. The data, compiled by the Global Forest Watch initiative, shows that the total extent of tropical forests shrank by just under 5 million hectares in 2020 - an area smaller than Switzerland. Deforestation was greatest in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the trend in managed forests, which include those under certification schemes as well as those under government or community management plans, was positive. ""The scale of progress towards more sustainable forest management is significant and encouraging,"" said Frances Seymour, the director of Global Forest Watch. ""But it's not enough. Deforestation continues to outpace forest restoration, and the climate crisis means we need all the tools we can get to protect forests and the vital carbon they contain."" Tropical forests are home to around half of the world's plant and animal species and are a vital bulwark against climate change, absorbing around 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. But they are under threat from agriculture, logging, mining, and infrastructure development. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to manage forests sustainably rather than simply protecting them from all human activity. This means maintaining forest health and productivity while ensuring the rights of local people and securing economic benefits. The increase in managed forests has been driven by a number of factors. In some cases, it has been the result of international initiatives such as the REDD+ programme, which aims to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and promote sustainable forest management. In others, it has been the result of national policies or community initiatives. For example, in Indonesia, there has been a shift towards plantation forestry, which is often more sustainable than the slash-and-burn agriculture that was previously common. But the challenges are significant. Forests are complex ecosystems, and managing them sustainably requires a long-term commitment and a significant investment in capacity-building and monitoring. And the pressure on forests continues to grow. The demand for agricultural land, particularly for the production of soy, palm oil, and other commodities, is a major driver of deforestation. And the climate crisis, which is making some forests more vulnerable to pests and other stresses, is adding to the challenge. Despite these challenges, there are reasons for optimism. The increase in managed forests shows that it is possible to move in the right direction. And there are signs that the private sector is beginning to take sustainability more seriously, with some companies committing to zero-deforestation supply chains. But more needs to be done.

Artist's designs for Alabama church bombing window on display,"The bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan on Sunday, September 15, 1963, was a new low in the fight for civil rights in America. As news spread of the explosion at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, the nation was left in shock and grief. Four young girls â Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley â were killed, and twenty-two others were injured in the attack. In the aftermath of the bombing, the community came together to rebuild and heal. One of the ways they did this was through art. A local artist named Frank Fleming was commissioned to design and create a memorial window for the church. The window was to be a symbol of hope, resilience, and unity, and would be a source of comfort and inspiration for the congregation and the wider community. Fleming, who was born and raised in Birmingham, was deeply affected by the bombing. He wanted to create something that would honor the memory of the girls and serve as a reminder of the importance of nonviolence and reconciliation. He spent many hours in quiet reflection, sketching out designs and considering how best to capture the essence of what the community was going through. The design that Fleming eventually settled on was simple yet powerful. The central image was a white dove, a symbol of peace, resting on a branch of olive trees, a symbol of reconciliation. Surrounding the dove were images of the four girls, their faces radiant and filled with light. Above the image was the inscription ""These Little Ones Shall Give in Memoriam,"" and below it was the date of the bombing and the inscription ""Love Conquers Hate."" Fleming worked tirelessly on the window, pouring all of his energy and emotion into the project. He wanted to make sure that it was perfect, that it would be a source of comfort and inspiration for generations to come. When the window was finally completed, it was installed in the church, and it quickly became a beloved and cherished part of the community. The window served as a reminder of the importance of unity and nonviolence in the face of hatred and hate crimes. It also served as a source of comfort and inspiration for the community, providing a symbol of hope and resilience in the darkest of times. And it continues to do so today, more than 50 years after the bombing. The 16th Street Baptist Church window, designed by Frank Fleming, is a testament to the power of art to heal and inspire. It is a reminder of the importance of nonviolence and reconciliation, and it stands as a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of hate and hatred.

Deepfake queen prompts 200-plus complaints to Ofcom,"The broadcast of a deepfake video featuring a well-known figure portrayed as a monarch on BBC Two's ""The Mash Report"" has led to over 200 complaints to media regulator Ofcom. The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age, but commentators argued that the jokes made in the clip were misjudged and potentially harmful. The Mash Report, a satirical news programme, aired a segment that depicted a deepfake video of a well-known figure appearing to make controversial and offensive comments. The video was intended to highlight the ease with which deepfake technology can be used to manipulate images and spread misinformation. However, some viewers felt that the use of a royal figure in the deepfake footage was in poor taste and could be seen as disrespectful. Ofcom, which is responsible for regulating broadcasting in the UK, confirmed that it had received over 200 complaints about the episode. The regulator said it was assessing the complaints to determine whether any rules had been breached. The BBC, for its part, defended the segment, saying that it was a clear example of satire and intended to raise awareness of the dangers of deepfake technology. However, some commentators argued that the use of a deepfake video of a well-known figure, particularly one with such a strong association with the monarchy, was insensitive and could be seen as trivialising the issue of fake news. Others pointed out that deepfake technology is a serious threat to democracy and the integrity of public discourse, and that using it for comedic effect could normalise its use and make it seem less threatening. The incident highlights the growing concern about the use of deepfake technology to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion. As the technology becomes more sophisticated and easier to access, the potential for abuse is greater than ever. The broadcasting industry, along with other media outlets, has a responsibility to use this technology responsibly and to ensure that it is not used to spread harmful or misleading information. The BBC's use of a deepfake video on The Mash Report was intended to raise awareness of the dangers of fake news in the digital age. However, the reaction from some viewers shows that there is still a need for greater education and understanding about this issue. The use of deepfake technology for comedic effect may be seen as harmless by some, but it can also contribute to a culture of disbelief and mistrust, making it more difficult for people to distinguish between real and fake information. As the use of deepfake technology becomes more widespread, it is crucial that broadcasters and other media outlets approach its use with caution and sensitivity.

Islamic State claims Kabul's latest deadly attacks,"On Wednesday, 48 people were killed in the bombing of an education centre in Kabul, most of them students studying for university entrance exams. The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, marking the latest in a series of violent incidents that have shaken the Afghan capital. On Thursday, another suicide bombing rocked the city, this time outside a mosque in the Shor Bazaar area, killing at least 26 people and wounding dozens more. IS also claimed responsibility for this attack, which came a day after the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the education centre bombing as a ""heinous and cowardly act."" The attacks have heightened concerns over the security situation in Kabul, which has seen a surge in violence in recent months. According to the United Nations, there were over 4,000 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first six months of this year, an increase of 24% compared to the same period last year. The Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K), has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country in recent months. The group has also clashed with Taliban fighters in several areas, adding to the complexity of the conflict in Afghanistan. The attacks have sparked condemnation from Afghanistan's international partners, with the United States expressing its ""deep condolences"" to the Afghan people and reaffirming its commitment to supporting Afghanistan's security forces. The European Union also condemned the attacks and called for an end to the violence. Despite the international condemnation, the attacks continue to take a heavy toll on civilians. The education centre bombing came just days after a car bombing in the city killed over 50 people and wounded more than 100. The attacks have forced many Afghans to abandon their daily routines, with schools, mosques and other public places increasingly becoming targets. The Afghan government has vowed to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice, but the security situation in Kabul and other parts of the country remains precarious. The Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency against the Afghan government for over 18 years, have also stepped up their attacks in recent months, adding to the complexity of the conflict. The attacks have also raised concerns over the future of the peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which have been ongoing since last year. The negotiations, which are being facilitated by the United States, are aimed at ending the conflict in Afghanistan and paving the way for a political settlement. Despite these challenges, there are signs of progress in the peace negotiations, with both sides reportedly making concessions in recent rounds of talks.

Calls for Wakefield asylum centre to shut after Covid-19 outbreak,"By Pritti Mistry, BBC News Dozens of residents have been dispersed from Urban House in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after a Covid-19 outbreak at the asylum seeker accommodation facility. West Yorkshire Police confirmed that 89 individuals have been moved to alternative sites following medical assessments and testing. The news comes after reports of positive cases among the residents emerged last week. The Home Office, which is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers, has not yet commented on the number of cases or the reason for the evacuation, but local councillors and charities have expressed concern over the situation. Cllr Maureen Cummings, Wakefield Council's cabinet member for adults and health, said: ""We are working closely with the Home Office and Public Health England to support those affected and to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to prevent further infections. The welfare of all residents is our top priority."" The Salvation Army, which provides support services for asylum seekers and refugees in Wakefield, has called for the Urban House accommodation centre to be closed due to ongoing concerns over living conditions and the risk of Covid-19 transmission. Major Paul de Duve, the charity's divisional commander for Wakefield and Pontefract, said: ""The Salvation Army has been working in the Wakefield area for many years and we have seen first-hand the challenges faced by asylum seekers and refugees in terms of access to healthcare, housing and employment. ""The current situation at Urban House is deeply concerning and we believe that the Home Office must take immediate action to close this facility and find alternative accommodation for the residents. The risk of further infections and the deteriorating living conditions are not acceptable."" The outbreak at Urban House comes as the number of Covid-19 cases among asylum seekers and refugees in the UK continues to rise. According to data from the Refugee Council, there have been 2,255 positive cases among this group since the beginning of the pandemic. The council has called for the government to prioritise the testing and vaccination of asylum seekers and refugees, who are often living in communal accommodation and face barriers to accessing healthcare. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said: ""The situation at Urban House is a stark reminder of the risks faced by asylum seekers and refugees in communal accommodation during the pandemic.

UK interest rates remain at record low of 0.5%,"The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has once again kept the UK's base interest rate at a record low of 0.5%, a level it has maintained since March 2009. The decision was announced on Thursday following the MPC's latest meeting, with the nine-strong committee voting unanimously in favour of keeping rates unchanged. In addition to keeping interest rates on hold, the Bank also decided not to extend its quantitative easing (QE) programme, designed to stimulate lending in the economy, beyond the Â£375bn already spent. This decision came as a surprise to some economists, who had been expecting the MPC to announce an extension of the QE programme in light of the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the decision to maintain the current level of QE, the MPC did revise up its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2021. It now expects the economy to grow by 5.2%, up from its previous forecast of 4.2%. However, the MPC also warned that there were significant risks to this outlook, particularly if there are further disruptions to global supply chains or if there is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Rates have been at 0.5% since March 2009, with the market expecting a small rise in the near future. However, the MPC has repeatedly stated that any increase in interest rates would be gradual and data-dependent. In its statement, the Bank reiterated its commitment to maintaining its accommodative monetary policy stance until the recovery is well established. The Bank also provided an update on its forward guidance, which sets out the criteria it will use to decide when it is appropriate to start raising interest rates. The Bank now expects to start raising rates when inflation is sustainably above its 2% target, which it currently expects to happen around the middle of next year. The Bank also stated that it would look at a range of labour market indicators, including unemployment and wage growth, when making its decision on rates. The decision to keep interest rates on hold and not to extend the QE programme is likely to be welcomed by borrowers, who will continue to benefit from low borrowing costs. However, savers will continue to be disappointed, with the return on their savings remaining low. The decision is also likely to be seen as a cautious one, with the MPC continuing to take a wait-and-see approach to the economic recovery. In summary, the Bank of England's MPC has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and decided against extending its QE programme.

Intensive care 'has lasting impact on mental health',"By James Gallagher, Health and science reporter, BBC News A study of 157 patients at University College Hospital, in London, has shed light on the lasting impact intensive care can have on mental health. The research, published in the Critical Care Journal, found high levels of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the survivors. The research team, led by Dr Rory Byrne, found that the combination of certain drugs used in intensive care and the stress of the experience could increase the risk of mental health problems. ""Our study shows that a significant proportion of patients who survive an intensive care stay go on to develop depression, anxiety and PTSD,"" said Dr Byrne. ""These conditions can have a profound impact on patients' quality of life, their ability to return to work, and their relationships with family and friends."" The researchers surveyed patients who had been in intensive care between 2012 and 2015. They found that 37% of the patients had symptoms of depression, 31% had symptoms of anxiety and 22% had symptoms of PTSD. The team also looked at the use of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines, and opioid painkillers, which have previously been linked to an increased risk of developing mental health problems. They found that patients who had been given higher doses of these drugs were more likely to develop depression and anxiety. ""Our findings suggest that reducing the use of sedatives and opioids could help to prevent some mental health problems in intensive care survivors,"" said Dr Byrne. ""We also need to explore other ways of managing pain and sedation in intensive care, such as using non-drug methods like physiotherapy and psychological interventions."" The study adds to growing evidence that surviving intensive care can have long-term consequences for mental health. A recent review of 31 studies, published in the Psychological Medicine journal, found that intensive care survivors were up to three times more likely to develop mental health problems than the general population. Dr Byrne and his team are now calling for more research into the best ways to prevent and treat mental health problems in intensive care survivors. They also want to see mental health support made available to all intensive care patients before they leave hospital. ""Intensive care survivors face a long and difficult journey to recovery,"" said Dr Byrne. ""They need our support and understanding, not just during their stay in hospital, but long after they have gone home."" The study also highlighted the importance of early detection and intervention for mental health problems in intensive care survivors. Dr Byrne and his team are working on developing a screening tool that can be used to identify patients at risk of developing mental health problems, so that they can be offered appropriate support as soon as possible.

BBC World Service to lose 73 jobs,"In a major shake-up, the BBC World Service has announced plans to cut 73 jobs as part of cost-saving measures. The English-language service will bear the brunt of these reductions, with 25 positions set to be made redundant. Additionally, news coverage will be reduced from 18 hours to 14 each weekday. The Arts show The Strand, a popular feature of the BBC World Service, will be axed from April next year. The show, which has been a fixture on the service since 1998, has provided listeners with in-depth discussions on art, literature, and culture. Its absence will be felt keenly by many listeners who have come to appreciate the insightful and thought-provoking conversations. Another casualty of the BBC World Service's cost-cutting measures is World Briefing. The daily news round-up, which has been a staple of the service since 1993, will no longer be produced. The show's presenters have been informed that their contracts will not be renewed when they expire in April 2023. The BBC has stated that these cuts are necessary to reduce its operating costs by Â£80m by 2025. The corporation has faced significant financial pressures in recent years, with funding from the UK government frozen at 2015 levels. The BBC has also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has resulted in a significant drop in revenue from its commercial arm, BBC Studios. The proposed cuts have sparked controversy and concern among staff and listeners. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticized the BBC for ""betraying its public service remit"" by making these cuts. In a statement, NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said, ""These job losses and service cuts will have a profound impact on audiences around the world who rely on the BBC World Service for accurate and impartial news and information."" The BBC has stressed that it remains committed to providing high-quality news and information to its global audience. However, with these cuts, some listeners may feel that the service is no longer able to meet their needs. It remains to be seen how the BBC will adapt to these changes and what impact they will have on the World Service's programming and reputation. In the meantime, those affected by these cuts will be considering their options, including applying for other roles within the BBC or looking for opportunities outside of the corporation.

Telford abuse: New victims come forward to police,"It comes after the Shropshire town's MP Lucy Allan spoke about the Telford abuse scandal in Parliament, she was inundated with reports from new victims and their families, urging them to come forward to the police. West Mercia Police confirmed that they have received additional reports and are working closely with the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and other agencies to support the victims. The MP's intervention in Parliament, where she highlighted the scale and severity of the abuse that took place in Telford between 1980 and 2010, has led to an outpouring of stories from survivors and their families. The Labour MP emphasized the need for ""proper resources, funding, and support"" to help the victims and bring the perpetrators to justice. The MP's call to action follows the publication of a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee, which found that Telford Council and police failed to adequately address the issue of child sexual exploitation (CSE) in the town. The report also criticized the Home Office and other government departments for their lack of action in the face of clear evidence of the problem. West Mercia Police have set up a dedicated phone line and email address for victims and witnesses to come forward. The force has also announced that it will be increasing its presence in areas where CSE is known to occur. This includes working closely with community leaders and local organizations to raise awareness and build trust. The NPCC's lead for child protection, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, has also urged anyone with information about abuse in Telford to come forward. He stated that ""the force will take all reports seriously and investigate thoroughly,"" adding that ""it is important that victims and survivors feel confident that they will be listened to and supported."" The issue of child sexual exploitation in Telford has been the subject of numerous investigations and reports over the past decade, but the latest developments have renewed calls for action. The MP's intervention in Parliament has brought the issue back into the spotlight and has led to a surge in reports from new victims and their families. It is crucial that the authorities take these reports seriously and provide the necessary support to the victims. The failure to address CSE in Telford in the past has led to widespread harm and trauma, and it is essential that lessons are learned and that the victims receive the help they need to rebuild their lives. The police and other agencies must work together to bring the perpetrators to justice and to prevent further abuse from occurring. This will require a significant investment in resources, training, and support for victims and their families. Only then can we begin to address the legacy of this terrible scandal and ensure that the victims receive the justice and support they deserve.

Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) is the first in the country to publicly consider such drastic measures in response to the financial pressures facing the National Health Service (NHS) in Wales. The health board, which serves over 700,000 people across North Wales, has proposed the closure of several hospitals and the downgrading of others to save Â£150 million over the next five years. The plans include the closure of Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E department, the downgrading of Llandudno Hospital, and the closure of community hospitals in the Denbighshire area. Dr Banfield expressed his concerns about the plans, stating, ""This is not just about the impact on individual patients and their families, but also the wider implications for GPs and primary care services. We are already under immense pressure, and these proposals could make it even harder for us to provide effective care for our patients."" The GP added that the proposals could lead to longer waiting times for appointments and procedures, increased pressure on GP surgeries, and a decrease in the number of beds available for patients. He also raised concerns about the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of patients and their families, who would have to travel longer distances to receive care. BCUHB has stated that the proposals are necessary to address the financial pressures facing the health board, which is expected to face a Â£152 million deficit by 2023. The health board has also stated that it will work to mitigate the impact on patients and ensure that they continue to receive the care they need. However, Dr Banfield and other medical professionals are not convinced. They argue that the proposals do not go far enough to address the root causes of the financial pressures facing the health board, such as underfunding and a lack of investment in primary care services. They also argue that the proposals could have a negative impact on the quality of care provided to patients and could lead to further financial problems in the long term. The Welsh Government has stated that it will work with BCUHB to consider alternative options and ensure that patients continue to receive the care they need. However, with the financial pressures facing the NHS in Wales showing no signs of abating, it is clear that difficult decisions will need to be made in the coming months and years. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the proposed changes to hospital services in North Wales are just the beginning of what could be a long and complicated process. The impact on patients, GPs, and the wider health system remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the rationing debate in Wales is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Charity's 'concern' at number of beavers culled in Scotland,"The Scottish Wildlife Trust expressed concern over the number of beavers that have been culled in Scotland, with estimates suggesting that approximately one fifth of the population has been affected. This revelation has sparked debate among environmental groups and wildlife enthusiasts, who argue that the impact of the cull could be quite significant. The beaver, once extinct in Scotland, was reintroduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Since then, their population has grown steadily, with estimates suggesting there are now around 1,200 animals living in the wild. The Scottish Wildlife Trust maintains that the beaver population is still recovering and that the loss of so many animals could have detrimental effects on their numbers and distribution. Beavers play a crucial role in their ecosystems. They build dams and lodges, which help to regulate water levels and improve water quality. They also create complex networks of canals and pools, which provide habitats for a wide range of other species. The loss of beavers can have far-reaching consequences for other wildlife and for the ecosystem as a whole. But Scottish Natural Heritage, which issues the licences for the cull, has defended the practice. A spokesperson for the organisation said that the culls were carried out in a targeted and controlled manner, and that they were necessary to prevent the spread of disease and to maintain a healthy population. The spokesperson also pointed out that beavers are considered a non-native species in Scotland and that their numbers are still increasing. The controversy over the beaver cull is not new, and it has been the subject of much debate in recent years. Some argue that the benefits of having beavers in Scotland far outweigh the costs, and that the animals should be allowed to live in peace. Others, however, argue that the cull is necessary to protect the health of the population and to prevent the spread of disease. The Scottish Wildlife Trust has called for a review of the culling policy and for greater transparency regarding the issuing of licences. They also want to see more resources dedicated to monitoring the beaver population and to addressing the threats they face, such as habitat loss and disease. Ultimately, the fate of Scotland's beaver population is a matter of ongoing debate and discussion. While some see them as valuable contributors to the ecosystem, others view them as a problem to be managed. Whatever one's perspective, it is clear that the beaver cull is a contentious issue that raises important questions about the role of wildlife in our landscapes and the balance between conservation and management.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Scottish government funding for youth unemployment priority areas,"The Scottish government has announced the priority areas set to benefit from its youth employment strategy fund. Glasgow, Renfrewshire, North and South Lanarkshire, and North and East Ayrshire are the first regions to be earmarked for this much-needed investment. These areas have been identified as having particularly high levels of youth unemployment, and the Scottish government is committed to taking action to address this issue. In Glasgow, the funding will be used to support a range of initiatives aimed at helping young people get back into work. This includes the creation of new apprenticeships and training opportunities, as well as the expansion of existing programs that have proven successful in helping young people gain the skills and experience they need to secure employment. Renfrewshire will also see significant investment in youth employment initiatives. The funding will be used to support the development of new enterprise projects, as well as the expansion of existing businesses that are able to create jobs for young people. In addition, the funding will be used to provide targeted support for young people who are at risk of falling behind in their education, and who may be at particular risk of becoming unemployed. North and South Lanarkshire will benefit from a similar package of measures. The funding will be used to support the creation of new jobs in key industries, such as construction and manufacturing, as well as the provision of training and apprenticeships. In addition, the funding will be used to provide targeted support for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, and who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. North and East Ayrshire will also see a significant investment in youth employment initiatives. The funding will be used to support the creation of new jobs in key sectors, such as tourism and hospitality, as well as the expansion of existing businesses. In addition, the funding will be used to provide targeted support for young people who are not in employment, education, or training, and who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The Scottish government has acknowledged that youth unemployment is a complex issue, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, by targeting funding to areas with particularly high levels of youth unemployment, the Scottish government is taking a proactive approach to addressing this issue. The funding will be used to support a range of initiatives, from the creation of new jobs and apprenticeships, to the provision of targeted support for young people who are at risk of falling behind in their education and becoming unemployed. The Scottish government is committed to working in partnership with local authorities, businesses, and community organizations to ensure that the funding is used effectively and efficiently. The goal is to help young people gain the skills and experience they need to secure employment, and to provide them with the support they need to succeed in the workplace.

Apostrophe ban on Devon council's new street names,"Mid Devon District Council made a surprising announcement last week, confirming that its new streets would no longer contain apostrophes. The council stated that this policy had been in place for many years, but had now been officially made clear. Apostrophes, once a common feature in street names throughout the district, could now only be found in three exceptions. The decision has sparked a lively debate among residents, with some expressing their disappointment at the loss of character and tradition. Apostrophes have long been used in Devon place names to indicate possession or to separate syllables. For example, the towns of Chagford and Tiverton both have streets named ""The Quadrant"" and ""Fore Street,"" which would now be simplified to ""The Quadrant"" and ""ForeStreet."" The council defended its decision, citing clarity and consistency as the primary reasons for the ban. ""We want to ensure that our street signs are as clear and easy to read as possible,"" a spokesperson for the council explained. ""Apostrophes can sometimes be confusing, particularly for visitors or those unfamiliar with the area. By removing them from our street names, we can help to reduce potential confusion and make our signage more consistent."" However, some locals argue that the loss of apostrophes will detract from the unique character of Devon's towns and villages. ""It's just another example of modernisation stripping away the charm of our area,"" one resident complained. ""These names have been part of our history for generations, and they add to the sense of community and tradition."" Others have suggested that the council could find a compromise, such as using apostrophes in street signs but omitting them from official documentation and maps. ""There's no need to completely erase the apostrophes from our street names,"" another resident suggested. ""We could keep the traditional names for the benefit of locals and visitors alike, while still ensuring that our signage is clear and easy to read."" The council has yet to respond to these suggestions, but has confirmed that the ban on apostrophes will be enforced moving forward. For now, the future of Devon's apostrophe-laden street names remains uncertain. Some residents are calling for a reconsideration of the policy, while others accept the change as a necessary step towards modernisation. Only time will tell whether the tradition of apostrophes in Devon place names will continue or be consigned to history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bill Clinton regrets 'three strikes' bill,"Speaking to a civil rights group in New York City, former President Bill Clinton acknowledged the regrets he harbors over a piece of legislation he signed into law during his tenure in the White House. The ""Three Strikes"" bill, passed in 1994, was a crime policy that mandated life imprisonment for repeat offenders with prior convictions. ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it,"" Clinton confessed to the attentive audience. He went on to explain how the legislation, which put 100,000 more police officers on the streets and established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, disproportionately affected the African American community. Clinton's admission was a significant departure from the stance he had taken in the past. At the time, he had hailed the bill as a major step forward in reducing crime rates and improving public safety. However, as the years passed, it became increasingly clear that the bill had the unintended consequence of exacerbating mass incarceration and perpetuating racial disparities in the criminal justice system. ""I was wrong. I did not understand the unintended consequences of this legislation,"" said Clinton, his voice filled with remorse. He acknowledged that the bill contributed to a culture of fear and punishment that too often targeted the most vulnerable members of society. Clinton's apology was welcomed by many in the civil rights community, who have long criticized the bill and its impact on communities of color. However, some were skeptical of Clinton's motives, pointing out that he had signed the bill into law more than two decades ago and that his admission came as he was campaigning for his wife, Hillary Clinton, who was running for the presidency at the time. Despite the criticism, Clinton's admission was an important moment in the ongoing conversation about criminal justice reform. It served as a reminder that even well-intentioned policies can have negative consequences, and that it is essential to constantly evaluate the impact of our actions and be willing to make amends when necessary. In the years since the passage of the ""Three Strikes"" bill, there have been significant efforts to reform the criminal justice system and address the issues of mass incarceration and racial disparities. Clinton's acknowledgment of his role in perpetuating the problem was a small but important step in this ongoing process. As Clinton spoke to the civil rights group, it was clear that he was not seeking to absolve himself of responsibility for his past actions. Instead, he was offering a sincere apology and a commitment to working towards a more just and equitable criminal justice system. ""I cannot change the past, but I can learn from it,"" Clinton said, his voice filled with determination. ""I hope that my admission today can be a catalyst for real change and a reminder that we all have a role to play in creating a",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Former US intelligence analyst charged with leaks to media,"Daniel Everette Hale, a former US intelligence analyst from Nashville, Tennessee, found himself in the crosshairs of federal authorities after being charged with leaking at least 17 top-secret documents to an unnamed journalist. According to the indictment unsealed in the District of Columbia on Monday, Hale, 31, is accused of providing the sensitive information between January and March of this year. The documents, which reportedly related to ongoing military operations and intelligence, were allegedly handed over in person and through encrypted messaging applications, according to court records. The indictment further alleges that Hale took the documents from his workplace, where he had been employed as an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) analyst since 2015. Hale's arrest marks a significant development in the ongoing investigation into unauthorized leaks of classified information to the media. The indictment, which was signed by a grand jury, does not reveal the identity of the journalist who received the documents or the news organization they work for. However, it does suggest that the leaks may have had a significant impact on public discourse, as some of the documents discussed ongoing military operations and intelligence. The charge against Hale carries serious consequences, as leaking classified information is a felony crime under the Espionage Act. If convicted, Hale could face up to 10 years in prison for each count. In a statement, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) emphasized the importance of protecting classified information and the damage that leaks can cause. ""The unauthorized disclosure of classified information undermines the ability of the intelligence community to protect our national security and puts lives at risk,"" said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. ""We will continue to investigate and prosecute those who illegally disclose classified information, and we will not shy away from holding accountable those who violate the trust placed in them."" Hale's arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving the unauthorized release of classified information. In 2013, former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of documents to the media, revealing widespread surveillance programs and sparking a global debate over privacy and security. Snowden currently resides in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, and faces felony charges in the United States. The case against Hale is being investigated by the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division, the FBI's Washington Field Office, and the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations. It remains to be seen how the investigation will unfold, but one thing is certain: the case will continue to raise important questions about the balance between national security and the public's right to know.

Holly Roe: 'Dress rehearsal' days before baby's death,"Holly Roe's life came to an tragic end just days before her first birthday, leaving her family and friends in a state of shock and grief. The young infant was pronounced dead at her home in Devon on the 12th of February, and an investigation was launched to determine the cause of her death. Holly Roe died from non-accidental injuries, and the prosecution claim she was shaken by her mother Tiffany Tate or father Michael Roe. The couple, both in their early thirties, have been charged with causing or allowing the death of their daughter. The trial began with the prosecution presenting evidence from medical experts, who testified that Holly had suffered multiple injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome. The expert witnesses also explained that Holly's injuries were not consistent with the explanation given by the defendants, who claimed that the child had fallen down the stairs at their home. As the trial continued, the court heard from witnesses who described the days leading up to Holly's death as a time of stress and tension in the Roe household. A neighbour testified that she had heard shouting and crying coming from the house on several occasions in the days before Holly's death. Another neighbour, who had interviewed Tiffany Tate just days after the incident, recalled her appearing agitated and distracted. The prosecution also presented evidence from the defendants' own words. In a recorded interview given on the day of Holly's death, Michael Roe told police that he had performed CPR on his daughter after finding her unresponsive. However, the prosecution argued that Roe's actions were too late, and that Holly could have been saved if she had received medical attention earlier. The defence attorneys argued that there was no definitive evidence linking their clients to Holly's injuries, and that alternative explanations for the child's death should be considered. They suggested that Holly could have sustained her injuries in an accident, or that they could have been caused by an undiagnosed medical condition. The trial continued with further testimony from witnesses and experts, as well as cross-examination of the defence and prosecution witnesses. The jury was expected to reach a verdict in the coming days, and the outcome of the trial would have significant implications for the Roe family and their future. As the courtroom watched the proceedings unfold, the emotions of those involved were palpable. The grief of Holly's loved ones was evident, and the weight of the evidence against the defendants hung heavy in the air. The trial promised to be a harrowing and emotional experience for all involved, and as the jury retired to consider their verdict, the future for the Roe family remained uncertain.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Army morale declining, Ministry of Defence survey shows","Thirty per cent of army personnel described their morale as low - up from 26% last year - the report showed. And the figures were even more dismal among junior ranks, with 36% of soldiers and 38% of non-commissioned officers reporting low morale. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) survey, which polled over 12,000 personnel, also revealed that long working hours, lack of rest, and low pay were major contributing factors to the decline in morale. The report stated that 72% of respondents felt they had insufficient time for rest and recovery, while 60% reported that their workload was too heavy. The MOD acknowledged the concerns raised in the report and pledged to take action to address the issues. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said, ""We take the findings of this survey very seriously and are committed to doing everything we can to improve morale within the armed forces."" However, some experts warned that the MOD's response may not be enough to stem the tide of declining morale. Dr. James Drew, a military psychologist and former army officer, said, ""The MOD's response is a good start, but it's not enough. Morale is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. The military needs to address the root causes of the problem, not just the symptoms."" Dr. Drew pointed to the issue of low pay as a particular concern. He said, ""The military is asking a lot of its personnel, and they deserve to be compensated fairly for their service. Low pay is a demotivator, and it sends a message that the military doesn't value its people."" The survey also highlighted the impact of long working hours and lack of rest on morale. Dr. Drew said, ""The military needs to recognize that its personnel are not machines. They need rest and recovery time to perform at their best. Long working hours and lack of rest are not only demotivating, they're also a health and safety concern."" The MOD has announced a series of measures to address the issues raised in the survey, including an increase in rest days, additional pay for working on rest days, and a review of working hours. However, some experts have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of these measures. Dr. Drew said, ""The military has been here before. It's made promises to address morale issues in the past, but little has changed. The military needs to take a long-term view and make fundamental changes to the way it treats its personnel if it wants to turn things around."" The survey also highlighted the importance of leadership in maintaining morale. The report showed that personnel who reported having a good relationship with their immediate supervisor were more likely to describe their morale as high. Dr. Drew said, ""Leadership is key.

Fishing boat discards 'hard to comply with',"Boats having to land unwanted fish caught in their nets started being phased in at the beginning of the year, under European laws. Throwing dead fish back into the sea, once a common practice to reduce the weight of catches and make room for more live fish, is now considered a wasteful and unsustainable method. The new regulations aim to address the issue of discards, which has long been a contentious issue in the fishing industry. The practice of discarding unwanted fish, often dead or dying, results in significant amounts of waste and can have negative impacts on fish stocks and the marine ecosystem. The European Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) introduced measures to reduce discards, including a landing obligation, which requires fishermen to land all of the fish they catch, with some exceptions for certain species and sizes. However, the implementation of these new rules has not been without challenges. Many fishermen have expressed concerns about the financial implications of having to bring all of their catch back to shore, particularly for smaller vessels and those targeting species with lower market value. In addition, the lack of infrastructure and facilities to handle and process large quantities of unwanted fish has been identified as a major barrier to compliance. Many ports and processing plants are not equipped to handle the increased volume of fish, leading to logistical challenges and additional costs. Furthermore, there have been reports of unintended consequences, with some fishermen switching to targeting more valuable species or using larger mesh sizes to avoid landing unwanted catches. This can result in further negative impacts on fish stocks and the ecosystem. To address these challenges, the European Commission has announced plans to invest â¬60 million in support of the implementation of the landing obligation. The funding will be used to improve port infrastructure, support the development of new processing technologies, and provide financial assistance to small-scale fisheries. The Commission has also acknowledged the need for flexibility and has announced plans to introduce exemptions for certain species and fishing methods. These exemptions will be based on scientific evidence and will be subject to regular review. Despite these efforts, the issue of discards remains a complex and ongoing challenge for the fishing industry and policymakers. The successful implementation of the landing obligation will require a coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including fishermen, processors, policymakers, and consumers. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure the long-term sustainability of fish stocks and the health of the marine ecosystem, while also ensuring the economic viability of the fishing industry. The challenge now is to find a balance between these competing priorities and to address the practical and logistical challenges of implementing the new regulations. As the fishermen bring their catches ashore, the unwanted fish are no longer discarded but are instead weighed, recorded, and processed for use as bait, fishmeal, or other purposes. The future of sustainable fishing depends on the successful implementation of these new regulations",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Technology companies must protect children online,"They were debating a report published in March by the Lords Communications Committee. The report, ""Growing up With the Internet,"" looked at the issues surrounding children's online safety and the role of technology companies in protecting them. The committee, comprised of senior members of the British Parliament, had spent several months examining evidence from experts, parents, and tech firms. The report highlighted the increasing use of the internet and digital technologies among children, with many starting their online journey before the age of five. It also highlighted the risks, including cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and the potential for addiction. Lord Knight of Weymouth, a former Labour minister and one of the report's authors, spoke passionately about the need for action. ""We cannot stand by and let our children grow up in a digital wild west,"" he said. ""It is the responsibility of tech companies to do more to protect children online."" The committee called on tech firms to take a more proactive approach to online safety, including stronger parental controls, clearer age verification processes, and more transparency around data collection and usage. They also urged the government to take a more robust stance on online regulation. Google's UK head, Matt Brittin, was among those called to give evidence. He acknowledged the challenges, but argued that the onus was on parents to take responsibility for their children's online safety. ""We provide tools and resources for parents, but ultimately it is up to them to use them,"" he said. However, many parents and children's advocacy groups disagreed. Sarah Brown, founder of the charity 'Mothers in the Making,' was among them. ""Parents need support, not just tools,"" she said. ""Tech companies have a responsibility to make the internet a safe place for children, not just for profit."" The debate continued, with arguments for and against the need for greater regulation. Some warned of the potential for a 'nanny state' approach, while others argued that the risks were too great to ignore. One thing was clear: the issue was not going away. As the debate drew to a close, it was clear that the report had struck a nerve. The issue of children's online safety was no longer just a matter for parents and teachers, but for all of us. It was a complex issue, with no easy answers. But as the digital world continues to evolve, it was clear that action was needed. The report marked a turning point in the debate around children's online safety. It was a call to action for tech companies, governments, and parents alike. It was a reminder that the digital world belongs to our children as much as it does to us, and that it is our responsibility to make it a safe and enjoyable place for them to grow up.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Libya civil war: UN envoy SalamÃ© says foreign intervention must end,"On the eve of peace talks in Berlin, United Nations Special Representative for Libya, Ghassan SalamÃ©, expressed his concerns over the role of foreign intervention in the ongoing civil war. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr SalamÃ© stated that foreign support for proxy groups in the conflict had created a ""vicious cycle"" of violence, which had hindered efforts towards finding a peaceful resolution. Mr SalamÃ© acknowledged the complexity of the Libyan conflict and the various actors involved. However, he emphasized that the foreign interference was fueling the violence rather than contributing to a solution. ""The foreign intervention in Libya has created more problems than it has solved,"" he said. ""It is time for all external actors to respect the sovereignty of Libya and allow the Libyan people to find a peaceful solution to their conflict."" Despite these concerns, Mr SalamÃ© told the BBC that he was optimistic about the upcoming negotiations. The peace talks in Berlin, which are being co-hosted by Germany and the United Nations, aim to bring together Libyan leaders to discuss a political solution to the conflict. Mr SalamÃ© expressed hope that these talks would lead to a meaningful dialogue between the different factions and pave the way for a peaceful transition. However, Mr SalamÃ© also warned that the negotiations would not be easy. He highlighted the need for all parties to approach the talks with a genuine commitment to finding a peaceful solution. ""The Libyan people have suffered enough,"" he said. ""It is time for their leaders to put aside their differences and work towards a better future for their country."" Mr SalamÃ© also called on the international community to support the peace process. He emphasized the need for diplomatic efforts and financial support to help rebuild Libya and provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. ""The international community has a role to play in supporting the Libyan people as they work towards a peaceful transition,"" he said. The UN envoy also acknowledged the challenges facing the Libyan people. He expressed his sympathies for those who had been displaced from their homes and had lost loved ones in the conflict. ""I understand the frustration and despair that many Libyans are feeling,"" he said. ""But I urge them to keep hope alive and to work towards a better future for their country."" As the peace talks in Berlin get underway, Mr SalamÃ©'s words serve as a reminder of the importance of finding a peaceful solution to the Libyan conflict.

Sri Lanka met Ban ki Moon panel,"The meeting in New York was not announced to the media by either the United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon or the Sri Lankan government. However, reliable sources have confirmed that a significant discussion took place between the UNSG, the Sri Lankan delegation, and a select panel of human rights experts on the 12th of March. The panel members took part in a discussion along with an officer named Lynn Pascoe, who is currently serving as the Chef de Cabinet to the UNSG. The closed-door discussion, which lasted over two hours, primarily focused on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, particularly in the aftermath of the civil war that ended in 2009. The panel consisted of prominent human rights activists, academics, and former UN officials, who were invited to provide their expertise and insights on the matter. The sources shared that the UNSG expressed his deep concern regarding the ongoing human rights violations in Sri Lanka, including allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Sri Lankan representatives, led by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, reportedly expressed their commitment to addressing these issues and cooperating with the international community. The panelists were given the opportunity to present their concerns and recommendations to the UNSG and the Sri Lankan delegation. Among the issues raised were the need for accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity, the protection of civilians in the context of military operations, and the promotion and protection of freedom of expression and association. The sources also indicated that the UNSG encouraged the Sri Lankan government to take concrete steps towards addressing these issues, including engaging with international human rights mechanisms and implementing domestic reforms. The UNSG reportedly emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the context of the ongoing reconciliation process. The closed-door nature of the meeting was intended to create an environment where frank and open discussions could take place. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns among some observers, who argue that the absence of media representation could limit public understanding of the issues discussed and the progress made. Despite the closed-door nature of the meeting, sources indicate that it represents an important step forward in the ongoing efforts to address human rights violations in Sri Lanka. The engagement between the UNSG and the Sri Lankan government on this issue is a positive sign that the international community remains committed to holding Sri Lanka accountable for its human rights obligations. It remains to be seen what concrete steps the Sri Lankan government will take in response to the discussions at the meeting. However, the fact that this high-level engagement took place is a promising sign that progress may be on the horizon. The international community will be closely watching to see how Sri Lanka responds to this renewed focus on its human rights obligations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Halton Transport: Bus company with huge losses goes into liquidation,"Halton Transport, which runs more than a third of services across the Cheshire borough, lost almost Â£620,000 in 2019, up from Â£460,000 the previous year. Despite efforts to turn the business around, the company has announced it is going into liquidation. The news has left many residents in the area worried about the impact on their daily lives. Halton Transport provides essential services, including school runs, commuter routes, and connections to larger towns and cities. The company's financial struggles can be attributed to a number of factors. One of the most significant is the decline in passenger numbers due to the pandemic. With many people working from home and avoiding public transport where possible, revenues have taken a hit. Another challenge has been the rising costs of operating a bus company. Fuel prices have been increasing, and the company has also had to invest in new vehicles to meet emissions regulations. Additionally, wages and salaries have gone up due to the national living wage and other cost-of-living increases. Despite these challenges, Halton Transport had been working on a turnaround plan. They had secured funding from investors and were in the process of implementing cost-cutting measures. However, the ongoing pandemic and the resulting uncertainty made it impossible to continue. The liquidation of Halton Transport is a blow to the local community, and alternative transport arrangements are now being put in place. The council has said it will work with other bus companies to ensure services continue to run. However, some routes may be disrupted or changed, and passengers are being advised to check for updates. The liquidation of Halton Transport is a reminder of the challenges facing the bus industry as a whole. Many companies have been struggling to stay afloat in recent years, and the pandemic has only made things worse. Without government support or significant changes to the way bus services are funded, it is likely that more companies will follow Halton Transport into liquidation. For now, passengers in the Halton area are being advised to plan their journeys carefully and check for updates on the council's website. The liquidation of Halton Transport is a sad day for the local community, and it is hoped that alternative arrangements will be put in place as soon as possible. As the buses of Halton Transport disappear from the roads, the focus now turns to finding a way to keep essential transport services running in their place. It is a complex challenge, but one that must be addressed if we are to keep our communities connected in these difficult times.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Will you be lonely this Christmas?,"Nick Triggle, Health Correspondent The twinkling lights, the crackling fireplace, and the scent of pine and cinnamon in the air - these are the hallmarks of the Christmas season. Nights spent at parties and catching up with friends, culminating with a Christmas surrounded by family. But the festive period is not like that for everyone. Age UK estimates about 450,000 will be spending this Christmas alone, and for some, the thought of facing another holiday season without company is a daunting prospect. Loneliness can affect anyone, regardless of age or circumstance. The loss of a loved one, a move to a new area, or the absence of close family can all contribute to feelings of isolation. And during the festive season, when the world seems to be in high spirits, the contrast can be particularly acute. For many older people, the absence of companionship can lead to a decline in physical and mental health. Research has shown that social isolation and loneliness can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and even Alzheimer's disease. Mentally, it can lead to anxiety, depression, and feelings of worthlessness. But there are things that can be done to combat loneliness during the holiday season. Voluntary organizations, such as Age UK and the Campaign to End Loneliness, offer a range of services and activities to help people connect with their communities and meet new people. From befriending services and community events to phone calls and letters, there are many ways to reach out to those who may be feeling alone. Technology can also play a role in combating loneliness. Video calls and social media can help people keep in touch with loved ones, no matter the distance. And there are apps and websites that can help people meet new people and join local groups and clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, there are still ways to stay connected and engaged. Many charities offer Christmas meal delivery services, while local churches and community centers may offer festive activities and events. And for those who are feeling particularly low, there are helplines and support services available, such as the Samaritans and the Silver Line. The holiday season is a time for joy and celebration, but it can also be a time of hardship and isolation for some. By reaching out and offering a helping hand, we can make a difference in the lives of those who may be spending Christmas alone. And in doing so, we can create a more connected and compassionate world for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Government sets out Â£1bn plan to cut industrial carbon emissions,"By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst The UK government has set out a Â£1bn plan to help industries cut their carbon emissions, with a focus on energy efficiency, low-carbon technologies, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The funding, which spans the next five years, is intended to help industrial companies reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15% by 2025, relative to 2015 levels. This equates to a reduction of around 30 megatonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), equivalent to the annual emissions of around six million average UK households. The government's Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, announced on Tuesday, includes a Â£500m Energy Industrialisation Fund to support the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies in industries such as steel, cement, and glass. According to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), this fund could support up to 100 projects. The strategy also includes a Â£200m Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, which will focus on research and development of new technologies, such as green hydrogen production, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and low-carbon aluminium production. Another Â£140m will be allocated to the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund, which aims to help companies identify energy efficiency improvements in their processes and install energy-saving equipment. The strategy also includes a commitment to accelerate the roll-out of CCS, with a focus on developing commercial-scale projects. The UK government has promised to invest in the infrastructure required to capture and transport CO2 from industrial sources to be stored in rocks underground. Business and energy secretary Alok Sharma said: ""We're determined to make the UK a world leader in industrial decarbonisation - creating high-quality jobs, reducing costs for businesses and keeping our country at the forefront of the global industrial sector."" The strategy follows the publication of the government's 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution in November, which included commitments to invest in renewable energy, hydrogen, and electric vehicles. The CBI, the UK's largest business organisation, welcomed the announcement, with director-general Tony Danker saying: ""Businesses know that cutting emissions is crucial for their long-term competitiveness and for the health of the planet. This funding will provide a welcome boost for those who are leading the way in driving down emissions."" However, some environmental groups have criticised the government for not going far enough to reduce emissions from industries quickly enough. Greenpeace UK's head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said: ""The government's new strategy is a step in the right direction but it lacks the ambition and urgency required to meet the UK's legally binding carbon reduction targets.""

Are we stuck with plastic drinking straws?,"By Louise Greenwood Business reporter John Sidanta, chief executive of Primaplast, acknowledged the growing international concern over the environmental impact of plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. However, he was adamant that affordable alternatives to plastic drinking straws were yet to be found. Sidanta's company, Primaplast, is one of the world's leading manufacturers of plastic straws. The demand for his product remains high, despite increasing public awareness and campaigns to reduce plastic waste. He argued that his industry was being unfairly targeted as a significant contributor to the problem. ""Plastic straws make up a very small percentage of the plastic waste that ends up in our oceans,"" Sidanta explained. ""The majority comes from larger items like bags and bottles. We're working on creating a more sustainable product, but the reality is that we need to find a cost-effective solution that doesn't compromise on quality and durability."" Sidanta's stance is not unique in the industry. Plastic straw manufacturers argue that they are an essential part of the food service industry and that alternatives, such as paper or metal straws, do not meet the same standards of hygiene and durability. However, some industry experts disagree. Dr. Stephanie Wright, a marine biologist at the University of Plymouth, believes that it's time for businesses to take a more proactive approach to reducing plastic waste. ""We've seen a significant increase in public awareness about the impact of plastic pollution on our oceans,"" Wright said. ""It's crucial that businesses take responsibility for their role in this issue. There are plenty of alternatives to plastic straws that are both sustainable and cost-effective."" One such alternative is the reusable straw. Companies like FinalStraw and LastStraw offer reusable straws made from stainless steel, silicone, or glass. These straws can be cleaned and used multiple times, significantly reducing the amount of plastic waste generated by disposable straws. Another alternative is the biodegradable straw. Companies like Aardvark Straws and Strawesome offer straws made from materials like paper, wheat straw, or bamboo. These straws break down naturally over time, reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans. Despite these alternatives, Sidanta remains skeptical. ""The reality is that consumers want affordable, convenient products,"" he said. ""Until we can find a cost-effective alternative to plastic straws that meets the same standards of hygiene and durability, it's going to be a challenge to make a significant impact on plastic pollution."" However, Wright remains optimistic. ""It's true that changing consumer behavior is a challenge,"" she said. ""But we've seen it before with other products, like plastic bags. It's up to businesses to take the lead and offer sustainable",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Catholic priest jailed for nine years for child sex abuse,"Father Paul Moore, an 82-year-old Catholic priest, was sentenced to nine years in prison after being convicted of multiple child sex abuse offenses. The crimes took place in various locations in Ayrshire, Scotland, between 1977 and 1996. The court heard harrowing testimonies from two of Moore's victims, now adults, who bravely recounted their experiences of abuse. The first victim, a man in his forties, described how Moore abused him at a school in Ayrshire during the late 1980s. He was just 13 years old at the time, and the abuse continued for several years. The man detailed how Moore would take him out of class for private lessons, during which the priest would touch him inappropriately and make him perform sex acts. The second victim, a man in his fifties, described how Moore abused him at his family home in the late 1980s. The priest had befriended the family and was a regular visitor to their home. The man, who was around 11 years old at the time, was left traumatized by the repeated abuse. He described feeling powerless and scared, knowing that he couldn't tell anyone about what was happening to him. The court also heard how Moore had previously been warned about his inappropriate behavior towards children. In 1992, a concerned parent had contacted the Catholic authorities about Moore's behavior towards a child. The authorities had launched an investigation, but no action was taken against Moore at the time. Defense lawyers for Father Moore argued that he was suffering from dementia and that his memory was failing him. However, the prosecution argued that there was ample evidence to prove that Moore was fully aware of what he was doing at the time of the abuse. The judge described the crimes as ""despicable and deplorable,"" and noted that the victims had shown immense courage in coming forward to give evidence in court. He also commended the Catholic authorities for their cooperation with the police investigation. Father Paul Moore's conviction marks a further blow to the Catholic Church, which has been rocked by a series of child sex abuse scandals in recent years. The church has faced widespread criticism for its handling of such cases, with many arguing that it has not done enough to protect children from predators within its ranks. The victims of Father Paul Moore's abuse have called for a public inquiry into the handling of child sex abuse cases within the Catholic Church in Scotland. They want to ensure that similar cases are prevented in the future and that those who have been abused are given the support they need to recover from their traumatic experiences. As Father Paul Moore was led away to begin his sentence, the courtroom was filled with a sense of relief that a dangerous predator had finally been brought to justice.

Italian runner braves Siberia big chill,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring The Russian and Italian media have followed the odyssey of Paolo Venturini avidly, from the initial stranding of his vehicle in the Siberian wilderness to his remarkable survival against the harsh, icy elements. The Italian runner, known for his endurance and determination, was participating in the Yakutia Ice Marathon when the unexpected happened. After completing the race, Venturini ventured deeper into the frozen landscape to explore the untouched terrain. His vehicle, however, became stuck in the snow, leaving him stranded. The freezing temperatures, plummeting to as low as -50 degrees Celsius, posed a significant challenge. With no shelter, food, or means to communicate, Venturini's situation seemed dire. His only option was to rely on his survival skills and endurance to wait for rescue. The news of the stranded Italian runner reached the Italian and Russian media, prompting a massive search and rescue effort. The local authorities, the Italian embassy, and various search and rescue teams mobilized to locate Venturini. The Russian emergency services and the Russian Geographical Society even dispatched a helicopter to the scene. Despite the grim conditions, Venturini remained hopeful. He built a shelter using branches and snow, and managed to start a fire using a flint and steel. He also rationed his water supply and hunted for food, using a rifle he had brought along for protection. After several days, the search team finally located Venturini, who was found in good health, considering the circumstances. He was transported to a nearby hospital for a check-up and then returned to Italy, hailed as a hero. The Italian media celebrated Venturini's resilience and determination, with headlines praising his ""survival against all odds."" The Russian media, too, acknowledged his bravery, with one outlet declaring him a ""true explorer."" Venturini's tale of survival in the Siberian wilderness served as a reminder of the human spirit's ability to endure in the face of adversity. His odyssey, filled with hardships and triumphs, was a testament to the power of determination and the importance of perseverance. As the Italian and Russian media continued to report on Venturini's journey, one could not help but be inspired by his story.

Channel Islands Air Search: Reserve fuel error blamed for crash,"The Islander aircraft, a twin-engine plane operated by Channel Islands Air Search, was on a mission to locate two missing fishermen in the English Channel when tragedy struck. With five crew members on board, the plane was flying at a low altitude, scanning the waters below for any signs of the distressed fishermen. However, as they approached Jersey's north east coast, something went wrong. According to investigators, a reserve fuel quantity indicator malfunctioned, leading the crew to believe they had more fuel than they actually did. The crew, focused on their search mission, may have overlooked this critical error. As they prepared to land on Jersey's St. Brelade's Bay Airfield, the pilot noticed the fuel gauge indicated they had sufficient fuel. However, as they came in for a landing, the plane began to lose power. The pilot attempted to abort the landing and take off again, but it was too late. The plane crash-landed on the beach, skidding to a halt just feet from the water's edge. All five crew members were able to evacuate the plane safely, with only minor injuries reported. The fishermen, who had been located nearby, were quickly rescued by local authorities and brought to safety. The incident was a stark reminder of the importance of accurate fuel gauge readings, especially in the demanding environment of search and rescue operations. The Channel Islands Air Search team, based at Jersey Airport, is a charitable organization that provides vital air search and rescue services to the Channel Islands and surrounding waters. The team operates a fleet of aircraft, including the Islander, to carry out search and rescue missions, medical evacuations, and other flights in support of the local community. The cause of the fuel gauge error is currently under investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The AAIB will examine the aircraft's maintenance records, interview the crew, and conduct tests on the fuel system to determine the root cause of the malfunction. Preliminary reports suggest that a component in the fuel quantity indicating system may have failed, leading to the incorrect fuel reading. In the aftermath of the crash, the Channel Islands Air Search team released a statement expressing their relief that all crew members were safe and praising the quick actions of local emergency services. The team also expressed their gratitude to the public for their support and understanding during this difficult time. The team remains committed to ensuring the safety of their crew and the communities they serve, and they will cooperate fully with the AAIB investigation to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Labour MP quits party review group over leadership disagreement,"By Ellie Price, BBC News Alison McGovern, the Labour MP for Wirral South and chair of the party's Progress group, has quit the Labour Party's review process over a disagreement with shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Ms McGovern told the BBC that Mr McDonnell had suggested Progress, the centre-left wing of the Labour Party, had co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers who left the government earlier this year. The resignations came amid a row over antisemitism within the Labour Party. In a letter to Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, Ms McGovern wrote: ""I cannot continue to serve on the Labour Party Governance and Constituency Party Review Group in good conscience, knowing that some within the party continue to make baseless and damaging allegations against Progress and its members."" Ms McGovern added that she believed the party needed to focus on ""uniting and rebuilding"" after the general election defeat in December 2019, rather than ""pointing fingers and making false allegations"". Mr McDonnell had previously accused Progress of having a ""hard-right agenda"", comments which Ms McGovern described as ""unfounded and defamatory"". In response, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""John McDonnell has made clear his views about the Progress group and its leadership, which are his own. The Labour Party is a broad church and we expect our members to respect each other's opinions."" The decision by Ms McGovern to quit the review group comes as tensions within the Labour Party continue to rise. The party has been embroiled in a long-running row over antisemitism, which has seen a number of high-profile resignations and allegations of bullying and harassment. Ms McGovern's departure from the review group is likely to be seen as a further sign of the deep divisions within the party. Some Labour MPs have called for more action to be taken to tackle antisemitism, while others have accused the party of being overly focused on the issue. The Labour Party has appointed a National Constitutional Conference to consider the recommendations of the EHRC report and shape the party's future governance. The conference is expected to begin its work in the coming weeks. Ms McGovern's decision to quit the review group is likely to be seen as a significant blow to the party's efforts to move on from the antisemitism row and focus on rebuilding ahead of the next general election. In her letter, Ms McGovern said she remained ""committed to the Labour Party and its values"", but believed that her role on the review group was no longer sustainable.

Zhao Ziyang: Purged Chinese Communist reformer is buried,"The remains of Mr Zhao Ziyang, who died in 2005 at the age of 85, were interred along with those of his wife in a quiet ceremony at a cemetery in Beijing on the morning of January 6, 2022. The low-key event took place at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, a prominent burial ground for senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) figures. Mr Zhao, a former general secretary of the CCP Central Committee and a key figure in Chinese politics during the late 1970s and 1980s, was purged from his position in 1987 after advocating for political and economic reforms. His fall from grace marked the end of the reformist faction within the CCP and the consolidation of power by the more conservative hardliners, led by then-party chief Jiang Zemin. Born in 1919 in Sichuan province, Mr Zhao rose through the ranks of the CCP under the tutelage of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. He was a key figure in the economic reforms that took place in China during the late 1970s and early 1980s, which saw the country open up to foreign investment and adopt market-oriented economic policies. However, Mr Zhao's advocacy for greater political reforms, including greater democracy and the protection of civil liberties, put him at odds with the more conservative elements within the CCP. In 1986, he publicly criticized the party's handling of student protests in Beijing, calling for greater openness and tolerance. This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the CCP leadership. In December 1986, Mr Zhao was stripped of his posts and expelled from the CCP. He was placed under house arrest and remained under effective detention until his death in 2005. Despite his fall from power, Mr Zhao continued to be regarded as a symbol of political reform and democracy in China. Mr Zhao's death in 2005 was met with an outpouring of sympathy and admiration from many Chinese, both at home and abroad. His interment at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, which is also the final resting place of other prominent Chinese political figures such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, is seen as a recognition of his contributions to Chinese history. However, Mr Zhao's legacy remains a controversial one. While some view him as a champion of democratic reforms and human rights, others see him as a dangerous advocate for Western-style democracy and a threat to the stability of the CCP. Regardless of one's view of Mr Zhao, there is no denying that he played a significant role in Chinese politics during a period",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Statins alert over IT glitch in heart risk tool,"A third of GP surgeries have been told to contact people who may have been given an inaccurate assessment of their future risk of heart disease. The alert follows the discovery of an IT glitch in a widely-used heart risk assessment tool, which has raised concerns among health professionals. The tool, known as the QRISK3 score, is used by GPs to estimate a patient's 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke. The score is based on various risk factors, including age, sex, smoking status, and blood pressure. The IT glitch affected the way some data was being processed, leading to potential inaccuracies in the risk assessments. The issue was identified by NHS Digital, which manages the QRISK3 tool, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which provides guidance on its use. In a statement, NHS Digital said: ""We have identified an issue with the way some data was being processed in the QRISK3 tool, which may have resulted in some inaccurate risk assessments being calculated. We are working closely with NICE to rectify the issue as soon as possible."" NICE has advised GPs to contact anyone whose risk assessment may have been affected, to arrange for a review of their cardiovascular risk and to provide them with updated information. The organisation emphasised that the IT glitch did not affect all risk assessments and that the vast majority of results were accurate. The discovery of the IT glitch has caused concern among health professionals, who stress the importance of accurate risk assessments in preventing heart disease. Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and deputy chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""It's vital that we get this right, as accurate risk assessment is crucial in identifying those at highest risk of heart disease and providing them with the appropriate preventative treatment."" The QRISK3 tool is used by GPs across England and Wales to assess the cardiovascular risk of around 24 million people. The tool is intended to help GPs identify those at highest risk of heart disease and to provide them with appropriate preventative treatment, such as statins. The discovery of the IT glitch comes at a time when the use of computerised systems in healthcare is increasingly common. While such systems offer many benefits, they also come with risks, particularly in relation to data processing and security. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust IT systems and regular testing to ensure their accuracy and reliability. In the meantime, GPs have been advised to contact those whose risk assessments may have been affected as soon as possible, to arrange for a review of their cardiovascular risk and to provide them with updated information. Anyone who is concerned about their risk of heart disease is encouraged to speak to their GP.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Frustration as garden centres in Wales stay closed,"Centres were among non-essential firms told to close their doors to the public before Christmas in Wales, amid growing concerns over the new Covid-19 variant. This unfortunate decision has left many frustrated, especially those who rely on gardening for their mental and physical well-being. Pugh's Garden Village in Cardiff, one of the largest garden centres in Wales, expressed their disappointment and concern over the impact this closure would have on their customers and the community. The team at Pugh's Garden Village emphasised the importance of gardening for people's mental and physical health, adding that the closure would prevent customers from accessing essential supplies and services. ""Gardening is more than just a hobby for many people; it's a way of life,"" said a spokesperson for the garden centre. ""Being able to get outside, connect with nature, and nurture plants can have a profound positive effect on our emotional and physical well-being. We understand the importance of this, especially during these challenging times."" The frustration among garden centre customers in Wales is palpable. Many took to social media to express their disappointment and concerns, with some questioning the logic behind the closure decision. ""Why are garden centres being closed when supermarkets and DIY stores remain open?"" asked one Facebook user, reflecting the sentiment of many others. ""Gardening is an essential activity for so many people, and being able to access the supplies and services we need to maintain our gardens is crucial for our mental and physical health."" The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has also voiced its concern over the closure of garden centres in Wales, urging the Welsh Government to reconsider its decision. ""Gardening is a vital form of therapy for many people, especially during these challenging times,"" said a spokesperson for the RHS. ""We urge the Welsh Government to reconsider its decision and allow garden centres to remain open, while implementing appropriate safety measures to protect customers and staff."" The frustration over the closure of garden centres in Wales is not unique to this country.

Arizona wildfire: Battling the blaze,"The interagency ""hotshot"" team, of which there are a number across the US, are highly trained and equipped to work in remote areas, tackling some of the most challenging wildfires. Based in the sun-scorched state of Arizona, this particular team had been bracing themselves for the inevitable onslaught of the wildfire season. As the mercury rose, so did the tension in the air. The team, a blend of seasoned veterans and eager newcomers, gathered around their base camp, a temporary set-up of tents and supplies in a secluded forest clearing. Their conversations were filled with the latest weather reports and the ominous names of the potential fires that lay ahead. The first call came in the dead of night, a harsh wake-up for the team. The Tonto National Forest was ablaze, and the hotshots were needed on the front lines. They quickly donned their protective gear - fire-resistant pants, shirts, and hoods, leather boots, and gloves - before loading up their gear into their fire engines. As they sped towards the fire, the team's nerves were on edge. The Tonto Fire, as it would come to be known, was a beast. The flames had already consumed over 1,000 acres and were spreading rapidly, fueled by dry vegetation and high temperatures. The hotshots' strategy was simple but effective - they would use a combination of direct and indirect tactics to contain the fire. Direct tactics involved directly attacking the fire's edge, while indirect tactics focused on creating a fire break - a barrier that would halt the fire's spread. The team divided into smaller groups, each with a specific role. Some began constructing the fire break, clearing vegetation and creating a barrier using bulldozers and other heavy machinery. Others focused on containing the fire's spread, digging fire lines and dousing hotspots with water. The work was grueling, with the sun beating down mercilessly and the acrid smell of smoke filling the air. But the team pressed on, fueled by their determination to protect the forest and the communities that lay in its path. Days turned into nights, and the team worked tirelessly, their progress slow but steady. They took turns sleeping, ensuring that there was always someone ready to tackle the next flare-up. And with each passing day, the Tonto Fire began to lose its ferocity. As the flames were finally brought under control, the team took a moment to catch their breath. The forest was saved, and they had each other to thank for it. The interagency hotshot team had once again proven their worth, their skill and dedication a testament to their vital role in protecting the wildlands of America.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Deadly earthquake rocks India, Nepal and Tibet","The epicentre of the deadly earthquake was located in India's mountainous Sikkim state, near the border with Nepal and Tibet. The quake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, struck late in the afternoon on Thursday, causing widespread devastation and tragedy in its wake. At least 18 people were reported dead in Sikkim, with many more injured and missing. The remote and hilly terrain, combined with heavy rain and numerous landslides, have made search and rescue operations a challenging and time-consuming process. In Sikkim's capital Gangtok, buildings were reduced to rubble, roads were cracked and blocked, and power and communication lines were down. Residents of the city and nearby villages were left without access to basic necessities, as authorities worked to assess the damage and provide aid. Across the border in Nepal, where the earthquake was felt most strongly, the death toll continued to rise. Officials reported that more than 1,100 people had been killed and over 6,000 injured. The country's largest city, Kathmandu, was particularly hard-hit, with many historic buildings and ancient temples collapsing under the force of the earthquake. In Tibet, where the quake was also felt, the Chinese government reported that at least 22 people had been killed and over 200 injured. The mountainous region, which borders both India and Nepal, was hit by numerous aftershocks, adding to the chaos and confusion. As rescue and relief efforts continued in earnest, international organizations and neighboring countries pledged their support to the affected areas. The Indian government, which has already dispatched military and paramilitary forces to the region, announced that it would provide 500 million rupees (around $7.5 million) in aid to Nepal. Meanwhile, the United Nations and various non-governmental organizations offered assistance and pledged to send teams of experts and relief supplies to the affected areas. India, too, opened its borders to allow foreign aid to be transported to Nepal, which is landlocked and relies heavily on imports. As the full extent of the damage caused by the earthquake became clearer, the international community came together to offer its support and condolences to those affected. The disaster was a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the power of nature, and a call for greater action and preparedness in the face of natural disasters. The recovery effort was expected to be long and arduous, but the people of India, Nepal, and Tibet were not alone in their struggle.

Air pollution: Benefits of cycling and walking outweigh harms - study,"Air pollution contributes to 40,000 early deaths each year in the UK, and it's a grim statistic that becomes even more concerning when we consider that we inadvertently gulp in more of it when we engage in physical activity. This paradoxical situation poses a challenge for public health officials and individuals alike, as they grapple with the question of whether the benefits of regular exercise outweigh the potential harms of air pollution. A new study published in the European Respiratory Journal provides some much-needed clarity on this issue and offers encouraging news for those who prefer cycling or walking as their preferred modes of transport. The research, led by Dr. Mark Nieuwenhuijsen from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, found that the benefits of regular physical activity, such as reduced risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, far outweigh the potential harms of air pollution. The study, which analyzed data from over 300,000 adults across Europe, found that even in areas with high levels of air pollution, the benefits of physical activity far outweighed the potential harms. In fact, the researchers estimated that for every hour spent cycling or walking, the potential harm from air pollution was outweighed by a reduction in the risk of early death of between 12 and 23 minutes. The study's findings are particularly relevant for the UK, where air pollution levels are a major concern, and where public health officials have been urging people to take simple steps to reduce their exposure to pollution. The study's authors emphasized that their findings should not be taken as an excuse for people to stop exercising, but rather as a reminder that the benefits of regular physical activity are significant and should not be overlooked. ""Our study shows that the benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks from air pollution, even in areas with high levels of pollution,"" said Dr. Nieuwenhuijsen. ""This is particularly important for people in the UK, where air pollution is a major public health concern. Our message is clear: don't let air pollution be a reason to avoid physical activity. The benefits of regular exercise are significant, and they far outweigh the potential harms from air pollution."" The study also highlighted the importance of encouraging people to choose active forms of transport, such as cycling and walking, as a way of reducing their overall exposure to air pollution. The researchers called on governments and local authorities to invest in infrastructure that makes it easier and safer for people to cycle and walk, such as bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets. ""Governments and local authorities have a role to play in making it easier and safer for people to choose active forms of transport,"" said Dr. Nieuwenhuijsen. ""By investing in infrastructure that makes it easier and safer for people to cycle and walk, we can help reduce overall exposure to air pollution and promote the many health benefits of regular",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Nora Ephron remembered at star-packed memorial,"Ephron, whose hit films such as ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" brought laughter and tears to audiences around the world, died last month at the age of 71. In tribute to her extraordinary career, 800 friends and family were invited to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City for a memorial service that celebrated her life and legacy. The room was filled with a who's who of Hollywood, as well as writers, directors, and actors who had been touched by Ephron's work. Among the attendees were Rob Reiner, Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Billy Crystal, and Carrie Fisher. They came to pay their respects to a woman who had not only entertained them but had also left an indelible mark on the industry. The memorial began with a montage of clips from Ephron's films, each one eliciting laughter and applause from the audience. Next, Rob Reiner took the stage to share some memories of his longtime friend and collaborator. He spoke of their early days in Hollywood, of the late-night phone calls and endless rewrites, and of the way Ephron could take a simple idea and turn it into a classic film. Meg Ryan then took the stage to share her own memories of working with Ephron on ""When Harry Met Sally."" She recalled the way Ephron had encouraged her to tap into her own vulnerability, to find the truth in her performances. She spoke of the way Ephron had believed in her, even when she didn't believe in herself. Tom Hanks, who starred in ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" shared a heartfelt story about how Ephron had once given him a pep talk when he was feeling uncertain about his career. He spoke of the way she had always believed in him, and of the way her belief had helped him to believe in himself. Billy Crystal, who had worked with Ephron on several projects, including ""City Hall"" and ""An Unmarried Woman,"" spoke of her quick wit and her ability to make him laugh even in the darkest of times. He shared a story about how she had once made him laugh so hard during a rehearsal that he had nearly fallen off his chair. Carrie Fisher, who had worked with Ephron on the film ""This Is My Life,"" spoke of her courage and her resilience. She shared a story about how Ephron had once helped her to get through a particularly difficult time in her life. She spoke of the way Ephron had always been there for her, no matter what. As the memorial came to a close, the room was filled with a sense of loss but also of celebration. Nora Ephron may no longer be with us, but her work will continue to inspire and entertain for generations to come. And",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cornton Vale inmates to be moved to HMP Polmont,"More than half of the inmates at HMP Cornton Vale in Stirling will be relocated to HMP Polmont, near Falkirk, later this year. It marks the beginning of a significant reshuffling of prisoners in Scotland's prisons, as part of the Scottish Prison Service's (SPS) strategy to reduce overcrowding and improve rehabilitation. The decision to move inmates from Cornton Vale to Polmont comes after a recent inspection report highlighted concerns over the conditions and safety at the Stirling prison. Overcrowding, understaffing, and a lack of educational and rehabilitation opportunities were identified as key issues. The Scottish Government and the SPS have been under pressure to address these concerns, and the transfer of inmates to Polmont is seen as a short-term solution to ease the overcrowding at Cornton Vale. The new facility at Polmont, which opened in 2012, has been praised for its design and focus on rehabilitation. The transfer of inmates will begin in the coming months and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Inmates who will be moved include those serving short sentences and those nearing release. The majority of those remaining at Cornton Vale will be women, young offenders, and vulnerable adults. The Scottish Prison Service has emphasized that the move will be carried out with the utmost care and consideration for the welfare of the inmates. A dedicated team of staff will be on hand to support those being transferred, and efforts will be made to minimize disruption and anxiety. The transfer of inmates is also part of a broader plan to modernize and improve Scotland's prison system. The Scottish Government has announced a Â£100 million investment in prison infrastructure, including the construction of a new prison near Grangemouth. The new facility is expected to open in 2024 and will provide much-needed capacity and modern facilities for inmates. The transfer of inmates from Cornton Vale to Polmont is a significant step in addressing the issues raised in the inspection report, and it is hoped that it will help to improve conditions for inmates and promote better rehabilitation opportunities. However, it is also important to acknowledge that this is only a short-term solution, and that longer-term investment in prison infrastructure and rehabilitation programs is necessary to address the root causes of overcrowding and improve the overall effectiveness of Scotland's prison system.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"European elections 2019: Remainers are angry too, says Vince Cable","The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, expressed his deep concern over the European elections results, particularly the anger and frustration felt by young people towards the political establishment. In an interview with the BBC, he acknowledged that remainers were not the only ones who felt disenchanted with the political process. ""The young people felt their future had been 'taken away from them by a very narrow group of people,' Cable stated, emphasizing the depth of disappointment and despair among those who had hoped for a different outcome. He went on to explain that it was not just about Brexit, but also about the broader issues of climate change, social inequality, and the future of Europe as a whole. Cable acknowledged that the European Parliament elections had been a ""messy and complicated"" process, with low turnout rates and a fragmented political landscape. He criticized the major parties for failing to provide clear and compelling reasons for voters to turn out and support them. ""People are looking for answers and they're not getting them from the main parties,"" he said. Despite the disappointing results, Cable remained optimistic about the future. He argued that the European elections had served as a wake-up call, a reminder that the political establishment could no longer afford to take voters for granted. ""We have to listen to people's concerns and offer them real solutions,"" he said. ""That's what we're trying to do in the Liberal Democrats."" Cable also spoke about the need for greater cooperation and unity among the European parties, particularly those who share a pro-European perspective. He called for a renewed commitment to working together to tackle the challenges facing Europe, from climate change to migration to economic inequality. Looking ahead to the future, Cable acknowledged that the road ahead would be difficult, but he remained committed to the cause of European unity and cooperation. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by nationalist and populist forces,"" he said. ""We have to come together, to find common ground, and to build a better future for ourselves and for future generations."" Despite the anger and frustration felt by many, Cable urged people not to give up hope. ""We have to keep fighting for the things we believe in,"" he said. ""And we have to keep working together, across party lines and across borders, to build a better future for all of us."" In the end, Cable's message was one of hope and determination, a call to action for those who still believe in the power of European unity and cooperation. ""We will not give up,"" he said. ""We will keep working, we will keep fighting, and we will keep believing in a better future for Europe and for the world.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tony Nicklinson's 'courage' will lead to law change,"Mr Nicklinson, a man with locked-in syndrome who bravely fought for the right to legally end his suffering, passed away on Wednesday. Tony, a 58-year-old man from Melksham, Wiltshire, had been unable to move or communicate following a stroke in 2005. He was trapped inside his own body, a devastating reality that left him yearning for release. Despite his debilitating condition, Mr Nicklinson refused to give up hope. He became an advocate for the right to die, campaigning tirelessly for the law to be changed to allow terminally ill or suffering individuals the choice to end their lives with dignity. His courage and determination inspired many, and his voice became a call to action for those who shared his belief that every person deserves control over their own fate. Lord Joffe, a long-time right-to-die campaigner, expressed his condolences and renewed his call for change in light of Mr Nicklinson's passing. ""Our thoughts are with Tony's family at this sad time,"" he said. ""But we must not forget that Tony's courage and determination have brought this issue to the forefront of public debate once again. MPs are not listening to society. It is time for them to act."" The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, which would have allowed terminally ill adults, who meet specific criteria, to seek a doctor's help to end their lives, was rejected by parliament in 2010. Despite repeated attempts, the bill has failed to gain enough support. But the tragic death of Mr Nicklinson, who had indicated that he would have sought assistance to end his life if the law had allowed it, has brought renewed attention to the issue. Those who support the right to die argue that it is a matter of personal autonomy and dignity. They point out that in cases like Mr Nicklinson's, where an individual is unable to live a life worth living, the state should not deny them the choice to end their suffering. But opponents argue that it is a slippery slope, that allowing assisted dying could lead to abuse and that the state has a duty to protect vulnerable individuals. The debate is a complex one, with deeply held beliefs on both sides. But the passing of Mr Nicklinson serves as a reminder that the law must keep pace with changing societal values and attitudes. His courage and determination will not be forgotten, and his legacy will continue to inspire those who believe that every person deserves the right to a dignified and peaceful end. As the nation mourns the loss of a brave and inspiring man, the question remains: will Mr Nicklinson's legacy lead to a change in the law? Only time will tell.

'Golden hello' offered to some new GPs in Scotland,"One hundred new GP training places are being advertised in Scotland, with a golden hello of Â£20,000 for some who choose to take up hard to fill posts. Some medical bodies are concerned that Scotland is facing a GP crisis, with the number of doctors in training failing to keep pace with retirement and an increasing population. The Scottish Government's recruitment drive is aimed at addressing this issue, offering financial incentives to GPs willing to work in areas with a shortage of doctors. The Scottish Rural and Islands Medical Training (SRIMT) programme, which is overseeing the recruitment, hopes that the financial incentive will encourage doctors to consider working in rural and remote areas, where the shortage is most acute. However, while the incentive may be attractive to some, medical bodies have raised concerns that it could create an unequal playing field in the recruitment process. The British Medical Association (BMA) in Scotland has called for a more equitable approach, arguing that all GPs should receive the same salary and benefits, regardless of where they choose to work. Dr Peter Bennie, Chair of the BMA's Scottish GP Committee, said: ""We welcome any initiative that helps recruit more doctors to Scotland, but we are concerned that this golden hello could create a two-tier system, with some GPs receiving a higher salary than others for doing the same job."" He added: ""What we need is a fair and equitable system that ensures all GPs are paid a salary that reflects the cost of living in their area and the demands of the job. Only then will we be able to attract and retain the doctors we need to provide high-quality care to patients."" The Scottish Government has defended the incentive, arguing that it is necessary to address the GP shortage in hard-to-recruit areas. A spokesperson said: ""We recognise that we have a challenge in recruiting GPs to some parts of Scotland, particularly rural and remote areas. This incentive is designed to help address that challenge and ensure that patients in those areas have access to the care they need."" The spokesperson added: ""We are committed to a fair and equitable approach to GP recruitment and pay, and we will continue to work with the BMA and other medical bodies to ensure that all GPs are paid a salary that reflects the demands of the job and the cost of living in their area."" As the recruitment drive gets underway, it remains to be seen whether the golden hello will be enough to attract the number of GPs needed to address the shortage in hard-to-recruit areas. With the population of Scotland continuing to grow, and an aging population putting increased pressure on the healthcare system, the need for GPs has never been greater. Only time will tell whether this recruitment drive will be enough to meet that need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"House prices see biggest monthly fall since 2010, Halifax says","The lender, Halifax, reported a significant drop in house prices for the month of April, marking the largest monthly fall since September 2010. The bank, part of the Lloyds Banking Group, stated that housing demand had weakened and supply had increased, leading to this notable decrease. According to Halifax, prices fell by 3.1% between March and April, following a 0.1% increase in the previous month. This sudden reversal in house price trends has raised concerns among economists and industry experts. Halifax Managing Director Russell Galley noted that the market was experiencing a ""marked shift in housing market conditions,"" with the recent increase in interest rates and the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic contributing to the decrease in demand. Furthermore, the bank reported that the annual rate of house price growth had slowed to 4.1%, down from 5.2% in March. This annual figure remains higher than the long-term average of around 2-3%, but the monthly decline indicates that this trend may be reversing. The housing market in the UK has been a topic of much debate as the country grapples with the economic impact of the pandemic. Many have voiced concerns that the sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the UK economy, could face a prolonged period of uncertainty and potential decline. However, some analysts have suggested that the fall in house prices could represent a welcome correction in an overheated market. The affordability crisis, particularly in areas such as London and the South East, has long been a concern for many. Others have pointed to the Government's extension of the Stamp Duty Land Tax holiday as a potential factor influencing the housing market. The holiday, which was introduced last year to stimulate the market during the pandemic, is set to end in September 2021. With the deadline approaching, some buyers may be rushing to complete their purchases before the tax increases. Looking forward, the housing market is expected to face a number of challenges in the coming months. The ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic, as well as the potential impact of rising interest rates, are likely to continue influencing demand and prices. Despite these challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the housing market. They argue that the structural drivers of demand, such as population growth and the continued shortage of housing, will continue to support prices over the medium to long term. However, the current state of the housing market is a reminder of the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the property market. For both buyers and sellers, it is important to carefully consider the current economic climate and seek professional advice before making any major decisions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Scottish women return after stem cell transplants in Russia,"By David Cowan, BBC Scotland Jill McLaren and Michele Murray have been living with multiple sclerosis (MS) for almost 20 years. Their stories are not unfamiliar in Scotland, where around 7,000 people live with the debilitating condition. But what sets them apart is their recent journey to Moscow for stem cell transplants, a treatment not available in the UK. Their initial plans to travel for the treatment were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the situation improving, they were given the green light to make the long journey in August. ""The thought of travelling so far during a pandemic was daunting, but the prospect of the transplant gave me the strength to carry on,"" said Jill, from Ayr. ""I had been living with the symptoms of MS for so long that I was desperate for a chance to improve my quality of life."" Michele, from Edinburgh, echoed those sentiments. ""I had been on various MS treatments for years, but they were only managing the symptoms. I wanted to try something new and potentially curative,"" she explained. The transplant procedure, known as haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, involves replacing the patient's diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells. In Moscow, the treatment is performed at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute, one of the few clinics in the world offering the service for MS patients. Both women underwent a rigorous screening process before being accepted for the treatment. The procedure itself involved a series of tests, chemotherapy, and the infusion of donor stem cells. Despite the challenges they faced, both women are now recovering well. The initial few weeks after the transplant were the most difficult, as their bodies adjusted to the new cells. But they are now regaining strength and mobility. ""I can't remember the last time I felt this good,"" said Jill, who is now able to walk short distances without a stick. ""The difference in my energy levels is incredible."" Michele, too, has seen improvements. ""My mobility has improved, and I'm no longer dependent on a wheelchair,"" she said. ""I'm looking forward to being able to do things I couldn't do before, like going for walks and even travelling again."" The women's experiences have raised awareness of stem cell transplants as a potential treatment for MS in Scotland. The Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland has welcomed the news, but emphasised the need for more research and funding for such treatments. ""We're delighted to hear that Jill and Michele have had positive experiences with stem cell transplants,"" said Fiona Tonge, the Society's head of care and support.

Gunman's parents 'raced to stop him',"They raced to Isla Vista but heard radio reports on the shootings as they drove, friend Simon Astaire told US media. Elliot Rodger, 22, warned of his intentions in a chilling YouTube video hours before unleashing a brutal rampage that left seven people dead and 13 others wounded. As the gravity of the situation became clear, Rodger's parents, Peter and Libby Rodger, were reportedly in a state of shock and disbelief. They had no inkling of their son's dark intentions, despite his troubled past and growing isolation. Peter Rodger, a Hollywood director, spoke to ABC News in the aftermath of the tragedy, expressing his deep sorrow and disbelief. ""I love him so much. I'm here to help, and I feel absolutely lost right now,"" he said, his voice trembling with emotion. Libby Rodger, a social worker, was described by friends as a nurturing and supportive mother, who had done everything in her power to help her son. But despite their efforts, Elliot Rodger slipped through the cracks, spiraling deeper into a world of anger and bitterness. Rodger's friends described him as a lonely and troubled young man, who struggled with social interactions and harbored deep resentment towards women. In his YouTube video, titled ""Why I'll Never Have Girlfriends, Why I'll Never Have Friends,"" Rodger expressed his frustration and anger, ranting about his inability to connect with others. Despite his troubling behavior, there were no warning signs that he would resort to violence. But in the hours leading up to the shootings, Rodger posted a series of disturbing messages on Facebook and YouTube, hinting at his plans. Friends and family members of the victims were left reeling from the shock of the violence, struggling to come to terms with the senseless loss of life. The community of Isla Vista was left in a state of mourning, as people came together to support each other and heal from the trauma. As the investigation into the shootings continued, it emerged that Rodger had a history of mental health issues, and had been in contact with mental health professionals in the months leading up to the attack. But despite these concerns, there was no evidence that he posed a threat to anyone. The tragedy in Isla Vista served as a grim reminder of the importance of mental health awareness and the need for better resources to help those in need. It also highlighted the need for more effective ways to identify and intervene in cases of potential violence, before it's too late.

The psychological secrets to successful resolutions,"Unfortunately, quite a few New Year's resolutions fail despite the best intentions. But there are some psychological tactics which can be employed to increase the chances of success. 1. Persistence: Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, conducted a study on people who successfully achieved their New Year's resolutions and found that persistence was a key factor. He defined persistence as continuing in a goal-directed manner despite obstacles and setbacks. It's important to understand that setbacks are a natural part of the process and not to be deterred by them. Instead, view them as learning opportunities and adjust your strategy accordingly. 2. Specificity: Instead of making broad, vague resolutions, make them specific and measurable. For example, instead of ""I will eat healthier,"" try ""I will eat five servings of vegetables every day."" The more specific the goal, the easier it is to focus on and work towards achieving it. 3. Self-compassion: It's important to be kind to yourself when making mistakes or experiencing setbacks. Instead of beating yourself up, practice self-compassion by acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to not be perfect. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer to a good friend. 4. Social Support: Having the support of friends and family can greatly increase the chances of success. Share your goals with them and ask for their encouragement and accountability. Joining a group or community with similar goals can also be beneficial. 5. Positive Thinking: Maintaining a positive attitude can help keep you motivated and focused on your goals. Practice positive self-talk and focus on the progress you have made rather than dwelling on setbacks. Visualize yourself achieving your goal and the benefits it will bring. 6. Small Steps: Making large, sweeping changes all at once can be overwhelming and often leads to failure. Instead, break your goal down into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on making one change at a time and once that becomes a habit, add in the next step. 7. Rewards: Giving yourself rewards for achieving small milestones can help keep you motivated and focused on your goal. Rewards don't have to be extravagant, they can be as simple as treating yourself to your favorite food or taking a relaxing bath. In conclusion, by employing these psychological tactics, you can increase your chances of successfully achieving your New Year's resolutions. Remember, persistence, specificity, self-compassion, social support, positive thinking, small steps, and rewards are all powerful tools in the quest for self-improvement. Happy New Year and best of luck in your resolve making!",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid:19: Robin Swann hopes for memorial in NI,"It has been a year since the first case of coronavirus was recorded in Northern Ireland, a milestone that marked the beginning of an unprecedented period of upheaval and change. The impact of the virus on individuals, families, and communities has been profound, with the human toll a constant reminder of the reality behind the numbers. According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, the death toll in Northern Ireland now stands at 2,055, with three more deaths reported on Sunday. Speaking during a press conference on Monday, Health Minister Robin Swann expressed his hope for a memorial to honor those who have lost their lives to the virus. ""As we approach the first anniversary of the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, I want to pay tribute to those who have tragically lost their lives,"" he said. ""It is important that we remember them and acknowledge the sacrifice they have made, not just for their families and loved ones, but for all of us."" Mr Swann went on to say that he had been in discussions with various organizations and stakeholders about the possibility of creating a permanent memorial to those who have died as a result of the virus. ""I believe that such a memorial would serve as a powerful reminder of the human cost of this pandemic, and help us to reflect on the sacrifices that have been made,"" he said. The Minister also acknowledged that the grieving process for many families had been complicated by the restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""I know that it has been a difficult time for many families who have been unable to grieve in the way they would have wished, due to the restrictions put in place to keep us all safe,"" he said. ""I want to assure them that their loss is recognized and that we will continue to do all we can to support them during this difficult time."" Mr Swann also took the opportunity to remind the public of the importance of continuing to follow the public health guidelines to help prevent the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable members of society. ""We have come a long way since the first case was recorded, but we must not become complacent,"" he said. ""The virus is still with us, and we all have a role to play in preventing its spread and protecting those who are most at risk."" The Minister's call for a memorial comes as the focus shifts towards vaccination as the key to returning to some semblance of normalcy. With the rollout of the vaccine well underway, there is renewed hope that life will soon return to something closer to how it was before the pandemic began. But for those who have lost loved ones to the virus, the scars will remain, and a permanent memorial may provide a lasting tribute to their memory.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Somerset badger cull fails to meet target, Defra admits","The cull ended last week in the west Somerset area, marking the completion of the latest attempt to reduce the badger population in a bid to combat bovine tuberculosis (bTB). However, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has admitted that the cull failed to meet its target. The target for the cull was a reduction of 70% in the badger population in the cull zone. However, estimates suggest that only 65% of the badgers were removed during the six-week period. Defra acknowledged this shortfall in a statement, confirming that the cull had fallen short of its objective. The cull, which saw marksmen shoot badgers at night using rifles fitted with special silencers, has been a contentious issue since its inception. Critics argue that the cull is inhumane and ineffective, while supporters claim it is necessary to protect livestock from bTB. The Badger Trust, an organisation dedicated to the protection of badgers, described the cull as a ""disaster"" and called for it to be halted. ""The cull has failed once again to meet its targets,"" a spokesperson for the Trust said. ""It's time for the government to acknowledge that this cull has not worked and to look for alternative ways to tackle bovine tuberculosis."" Defra, however, remains committed to the cull as a means of controlling bTB in cattle. ""We remain convinced that the controlled badger cull is an essential part of our strategy to tackle bovine tuberculosis,"" a Defra spokesperson said. ""We will continue to work closely with farmers and local communities to ensure that the cull is carried out humanely and effectively."" Despite Defra's assurances, the failure of the cull to meet its target will be seen as a setback for those who support the measure. The next cull is due to take place in Gloucestershire and Somerset later this year, and it remains to be seen whether it will be more successful in achieving its objectives. In the meantime, farmers in the area are facing the prospect of another year of dealing with the disease. Bovine tuberculosis is a highly contagious and often fatal disease that can spread rapidly amongst cattle herds. The disease can cause significant economic losses, as well as animal welfare concerns. The failure of the cull to meet its target will also raise questions about the cost-effectiveness of the measure. The cull, which is estimated to cost around Â£10 million a year, has been criticised for being an expensive and ineffective way to tackle bTB. As the debate over the badger cull continues, it is clear that there is no easy answer to the problem of bovine tuberculosis.

David Cameron backs Maria Miller as expenses inquiry launched,"The prime minister, David Cameron, offered his unwavering support for Culture Secretary Maria Miller during a press conference on Wednesday, as she faced an inquiry into her parliamentary expenses. The inquiry was launched following a complaint from Labour MP John Mann, who questioned claims made by Miller regarding the costs incurred for refurbishing her second home. Miller had previously allowed her parents to contribute towards the expenses for the renovation of her apartment in London, which she also uses as her constituency office. However, the payments were not declared until several years later, when she was appointed as a government minister. Addressing the media, Cameron acknowledged the controversy surrounding Miller's expenses claims but expressed confidence in her ability to provide satisfactory explanations. ""Maria has given excellent answers on this matter,"" he stated. ""She has addressed the issue in full and has been completely transparent."" Miller herself released a statement earlier in the day, acknowledging the oversight and apologizing for any confusion. ""I want to be absolutely clear that I did not knowingly mislead the House,"" she said. ""I deeply regret any uncertainty or concern this has caused."" The prime minister's defence of Miller comes as the Conservative Party faces renewed criticism over its handling of expenses claims. In 2009, the expenses scandal involving several MPs, including then-deputy prime minister John Prescott and Speaker of the House Michael Martin, led to a public outcry and a wave of resignations. Opposition parties criticized Cameron's stance on the issue, with Labour leader Ed Miliband accusing the prime minister of double standards. ""The PM says he has confidence in Maria Miller, but he sacked Chris Huhne over a speeding offence,"" Miliband tweeted. ""Where is the consistency?"" The inquiry into Miller's expenses claims is being led by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Hudson. It is expected to take several weeks, during which Miller will be required to provide further evidence and clarification on her expenses records. Despite the controversy, Cameron expressed confidence that the inquiry would clear up any remaining doubts. ""We will wait for the outcome of the investigation,"" he said. ""I am confident that Maria will be found to have acted in good faith."" The prime minister's backing of Miller comes as he faces renewed pressure to tackle the issue of expenses more robustly, with calls for greater transparency and stricter rules.

Kincora should be part of UK inquiry into child abuse says Amnesty,"It follows claims of an establishment ""cover-up"" over allegations of paedophile activity at Westminster that Home Secretary Teresa May has announced a new investigation into how the government handled these claims. Now Amnesty International's Northern Ireland (NI) director Patrick Corrigan has added his voice to the call for a wide-ranging inquiry, specifically mentioning Kincora Boys' Home as a critical area of focus. Kincora Boys' Home, located in Belfast, was a former children's home that was infamously linked to allegations of historical child abuse. The home operated from the 1920s until it closed in the 1980s, and many former residents have come forward with harrowing accounts of abuse they suffered there. Some have even claimed that politicians, high-ranking police officers, and other influential figures were involved. Corrigan stated that Amnesty believes that ""the UK inquiry should include a thorough examination of the Kincora scandal and its aftermath, and the response of the authorities to the allegations. This will be essential to uncover the truth and to ensure that those responsible are held to account."" The Kincora scandal first came to public attention in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A series of investigative reports in the media led to the exposure of widespread abuse at the home. Some residents were subjected to physical and sexual abuse, while others were used for the gratification of the abusers. The most infamous allegation involved a former resident who claimed he was forced to perform sex acts for high-ranking politicians and police officers in exchange for favours and protection. Despite these allegations, there has been a distinct lack of progress in bringing those responsible to justice. Several investigations have been carried out over the years, but many former residents feel that their claims have not been taken seriously enough. Additionally, some have expressed concern that those in positions of power have used their influence to shield themselves from scrutiny. Corrigan believes that the new investigation offers an opportunity to finally bring closure to the victims and their families. ""This inquiry must be independent, well-resourced, and given the time it needs to properly examine all the evidence. It must also ensure that victims and survivors are at the centre of the process and that they are supported throughout,"" he said. The Kincora scandal is just one of many historical child abuse cases that have come to light in recent years. The wider public has become increasingly aware of the extent of the problem and the need for justice for victims. The new investigation into allegations of paedophile activity at Westminster offers an opportunity to bring closure to these cases and to ensure that those responsible are held to account. Amnesty's call for the investigation to include a thorough examination of the Kincora scandal is an important step towards achieving that goal.

Scrap metal laws to be tightened to tackle theft,"Home Secretary Theresa May announced the proposed new laws in a written statement to MPs, outlining plans to tighten scrap metal laws and tackle the issue of metal theft that has disrupted rail services and caused significant damage to infrastructure across the country. The proposed measures aim to end the current ""low-risk transactions"" that have allowed people to sell stolen metal for cash, often without proper identification or proof of ownership. Under the new laws, scrap metal dealers will be required to carry out more thorough checks on those looking to sell metal, including asking for identification and conducting background checks on those with a history of metal theft. May also announced plans to introduce a mandatory reporting system, requiring dealers to report any suspicious transactions to the police. This will help to identify and prosecute those involved in metal theft, and prevent the sale of stolen metal on the black market. The Home Secretary emphasised the importance of these measures, stating that metal theft not only causes significant disruption and damage, but also puts lives at risk. In particular, the theft of copper cables from railway tracks can cause electrical faults, leading to derailments and other accidents. The proposed laws have been welcomed by rail operators, who have been hit hard by metal theft in recent years. Network Rail, which manages the national railway infrastructure, has reported an increase in metal theft incidents, with over 3,000 incidents recorded in the past year alone. This has resulted in significant delays and disruption to services, as well as the cost of repairing the damage caused by the theft. The new measures are expected to come into force in the coming months, following consultation with industry stakeholders and parliamentary scrutiny. May has urged scrap metal dealers to support the new laws, stating that they have a responsibility to prevent the sale of stolen metal and protect the integrity of their industry. In addition to the new laws, the Home Secretary also announced plans to increase funding for community initiatives aimed at preventing metal theft. This includes funding for metal theft prevention projects, as well as support for local police forces to tackle metal theft hotspots. May concluded her statement by urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspected metal theft incidents to the police. She also emphasised the importance of working together to tackle this issue and prevent the disruption and damage caused by metal theft. The proposed new scrap metal laws represent a significant step forward in the fight against metal theft, and are expected to have a positive impact on the rail industry and the wider community. With the support of scrap metal dealers, the police, and the public, these measures will help to prevent the sale of stolen metal and keep lives safe.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Nintendo forecasts loss amid weak Wii U sales,"Nintendo, the Japanese video game giant, has revised its financial forecasts for the current fiscal year, projecting an operating loss of 35bn yen ($335m; Â£205m). This is a significant shift from its initial estimate of an operating profit of 100bn yen. The revision came as the company acknowledged weak sales of its Wii U console, which has failed to match the success of its predecessor, the Wii. Nintendo had high hopes for the Wii U, which was launched in late 2012, featuring a new controller with a touch screen and the ability to stream media content. However, the console has struggled to gain traction in the market, with sales lagging behind those of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The company now expects to sell only 2.8 million Wii U consoles in the current fiscal year, down from its initial projection of 3.6 million units. Nintendo also revised downward its sales forecast for software for the console, projecting sales of 12 million units, compared with its previous estimate of 18 million units. Nintendo's disappointing sales figures come as the global video game market continues to grow, driven by the popularity of mobile games and the success of new consoles. According to market research firm Newzoo, the global video game market is expected to generate revenues of $91.5 billion in 2014, up from $87.1 billion in 2013. Despite the weak sales of the Wii U, Nintendo remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the console. The company believes that the Wii U's unique features, such as the ability to play games on a tablet-like controller, will help it appeal to consumers in the long run. Nintendo is also planning to release new software titles for the console, including the highly anticipated Super Smash Bros. game. In addition to the Wii U, Nintendo continues to focus on its other businesses, including the 3DS handheld console and its mobile gaming business. The company has seen strong sales of the 3DS, which has sold over 40 million units worldwide. Nintendo also recently launched its first mobile game, Miitomo, which has been downloaded by over 10 million users since its release in March. Nintendo's financial woes come as the company faces increasing competition in the video game market. The success of new consoles, such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, has put pressure on Nintendo to innovate and offer compelling new games and experiences to consumers. The company is also facing competition from mobile games, which have become increasingly popular among consumers. Despite these challenges, Nintendo remains committed to its mission of creating unique and innovative gaming experiences for consumers. The company is currently working on several new projects, including a new console codenamed NX, which is expected to be released",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sabarimala temple: Indian women form '620km human chain' for equality,"The Sabarimala shrine, located in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, has been a subject of controversy and debate for decades. Historically closed to women of menstruating age - defined as between 10 and 50 - the temple's tradition was rooted in Hindu mythology and beliefs. However, India's top court overturned this ban in September 2018, allowing women of all ages to enter the temple premises. Despite the ruling, the temple has seen several protests and attacks against female visitors. In response to these incidents, a group of women have come together to form a 620km human chain, called the ""women's wall,"" to show their support for gender equality and the right to worship at the Sabarimala temple. The women's wall was organised on January 20, 2019, with the participation of over 5 lakh (500,000) women. The chain stretched from Kasargod in the north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south, covering all 14 districts of Kerala. The women, dressed in traditional attire, held hands and walked together, creating a powerful visual representation of unity and solidarity. The idea for the women's wall was first proposed by Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, in the wake of the temple controversy. The event was organised by various women's organisations and political parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian National Congress. The women's wall was not just a symbolic demonstration but also aimed to create awareness and educate people about gender equality and women's rights. The participants carried placards and banners with messages supporting the cause, and many spoke about the importance of fighting against discrimination and prejudice. The women's wall received widespread support and coverage in the media, both in India and abroad. It was seen as a significant step towards promoting gender equality and challenging traditional norms and beliefs. Many celebrities and political figures expressed their support for the event, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, who tweeted her appreciation for the initiative. The Sabarimala temple controversy is just one of many instances of gender discrimination and inequality that exist in India. The women's wall is a reminder that there is still a long way to go in achieving true gender equality. However, the event also serves as a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of women in India and their determination to challenge discriminatory practices and fight for their rights. As the women's wall came to an end, the participants dispersed, each carrying with them a renewed sense of hope and determination. The event marked a significant step forward in the ongoing struggle for gender equality in India and served as a reminder that change is possible when people come together and stand",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Dumfries and Galloway Council made Â£6.9m waste deal payment,"The figure of Â£6.9 million emerged after a BBC Freedom of Information request regarding the financial impact of ending the contract with Shanks Dumfries and Galloway (SDG) on the Dumfries and Galloway Council. Company accounts obtained from Companies House revealed that the local authority had made this substantial payment to the waste management firm in the financial year 2020-2021. This payment, which represents a significant portion of the council's annual budget, is a result of the early termination of the 25-year PFI (Private Finance Initiative) contract between the council and SDG, which commenced in 2002. The council announced the termination of the contract in March 2021, citing financial and operational concerns. The council's decision to terminate the contract resulted from a series of issues, including the poor performance of the waste collection service provided by SDG and the financial burden of maintaining the contract. According to the council, the early termination would save them approximately Â£2.5 million per annum in management fees and other costs. However, the Â£6.9 million payment to SDG represents a considerable upfront cost for the council. The council's finance spokesperson, Alan Young, stated that the payment was ""unavoidable"" due to the terms of the PFI contract. Young added that the council had explored all possible options to mitigate the cost, including negotiating with SDG and seeking legal advice. The payment to SDG has raised concerns among councillors and local residents. Some have criticised the council for the large upfront cost, while others have questioned the wisdom of the PFI contract in the first place. In response to these criticisms, the council has emphasised the need to address the operational and financial issues with the waste management service and to secure a more cost-effective solution for the future. According to the council, they have already taken steps to mitigate the financial impact of the termination payment. They have secured a new waste management contract with EUROGP, which will begin in April 2022. The new contract is expected to save the council Â£1.5 million per annum in comparison to the previous contract. The council has also indicated that they are exploring options to recover some of the termination payment from SDG. They have engaged legal advisors to assess their options for potential claims against the company. Despite these efforts, the council's decision to terminate the contract and the associated termination payment have left a sour taste in the mouths of some residents and councillors. The controversy surrounding the payment highlights the challenges and costs associated with PFI contracts, and the importance of careful consideration and negotiation when entering into such agreements. As the council moves forward with its new waste management contract and seeks to recover some of the termination payment, it remains to be seen what the long-term impact of",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Slow progress' on child abuse claims in Pembrokeshire,"A follow-up report commissioned by the Welsh Government on child safeguarding in Pembrokeshire has identified improvements since the publication of the initial investigation in 2018. However, the management of allegations against professionals working for the local council remains ""inconsistent,"" according to the findings. The initial report, carried out by the former Children's Commissioner for Wales, criticised the council for its handling of child abuse claims, particularly in the case of a child who was subjected to years of abuse. The new report, carried out by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW), has acknowledged that progress has been made, but significant concerns remain. The CSSIW report noted that while there have been improvements in the recruitment and selection of staff, and in the implementation of training programmes, there are still issues with the management of allegations against council professionals. The report states that ""there is still a lack of consistent and effective responses to allegations."" The council has acknowledged the findings of the report and has stated that it is considering the recommendations carefully. A spokesperson for the council said, ""The council accepts that while there have been improvements in the way we deal with allegations against our staff, there is still more work to be done. We are committed to ensuring that all our children are safe and that we have robust processes in place to deal with any allegations made against our staff."" However, critics have expressed concern that the council has not yet taken sufficient action to address the issues raised in the report. Labour's Shadow Minister for Children, Huw Irranca-Davies, said, ""It's deeply concerning that the council is still not getting this right. The first report highlighted serious failings, and it's unacceptable that these issues are still persisting. The council needs to take urgent action to address the inconsistencies in the management of allegations against council staff."" Claims had emerged that some council staff had been allowed to continue working in roles where they had previously been accused of abuse or neglect, despite being subject to investigations. The initial report called for an independent review of all cases where allegations had been made against council staff, and for a new process to be put in place to deal with allegations more effectively. The CSSIW report also identified a need for greater transparency and accountability in the way that the council deals with allegations against its staff. It recommended that the council should publish an annual report detailing the number and outcome of allegations made against staff, as well as the actions taken in response. The council has yet to respond to this recommendation, but it has stated that it will continue to work closely with the Welsh Government and with external agencies to ensure that it has the necessary processes in place to protect children and to deal effectively with any allegations made against staff.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
St George's Reforne church restored to former glory,"High above the cliff tops of the Isle of Portland's West Bay sits St George's Reforne church. Its mystery and intrigue become ever more compelling when the sea mist rolls in and the ancient structure seems to disappear into the fog. This historic church, which dates back to the 14th century, has undergone a significant restoration project to return it to its former glory. The restoration process began in 2019, with the aim of preserving this precious piece of history for future generations. The project was led by the Churches Conservation Trust, in partnership with Dorset County Council and Portland Parish Council. The work involved repairing the roof, stabilizing the tower, and restoring the interior decorations. As you approach the church, you are struck by the impressive size of the tower, which stands tall against the backdrop of the sea. The tower, which dates from the 15th century, was in a dangerous condition, with significant cracks and instability. The restoration team worked meticulously to repair the damage, using traditional construction techniques and locally sourced materials. Once inside, the intricately painted ceiling and ornate wall decorations take your breath away. These stunning features were hidden for decades, covered in layers of grime and dirt. The restoration team carefully removed the old paint and plaster, revealing the beautiful decorations beneath. The intricate patterns and vibrant colours were then carefully restored, bringing the interior back to life. One of the most fascinating discoveries during the restoration process was the ancient graffiti on the church walls. Dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries, these markings offer a glimpse into the lives of those who worshipped here hundreds of years ago. The team carefully recorded and preserved the graffiti, ensuring that it will be appreciated by visitors for generations to come. The restoration project has also uncovered the rich history of the church and its connection to the community. The church was originally built as a chapel of ease for the parishioners of St George's Church in Portland town. Over the centuries, it has served as a place of worship, a school, and even a temporary morgue during the Black Death. Today, St George's Reforne church stands proudly on the cliff tops, a testament to the craftsmanship and dedication of those who built it and those who have worked to restore it. Visitors can now explore the church and its history, taking in the beautiful decorations, the ancient graffiti, and the breathtaking views of the sea. As you leave the church and make your way down the cliff path, the sun sets over the sea, casting a golden glow over the water. The mist begins to roll in once again, enveloping the church in a mystical haze. The sense of history and mystery that once drew you to this place remains, but now it is accompanied by the knowledge",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Luton Borough Council proposes cuts to plug Â£22m shortfall,"Luton Borough Council, located in the heart of Bedfordshire, England, has announced that its income from Luton Airport ""has all but dried up,"" leaving the local authority facing a daunting financial crisis. The council stated that it is currently grappling with a Â£50m shortfall and must make nearly Â£22m in savings to avoid the unthinkable. The council's predicament is largely due to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. With international travel restrictions and lockdown measures in place, Luton Airport, a major source of income for the council, has seen passenger numbers plummet. Before the pandemic, Luton Airport was the fifth-busiest airport in the UK, serving over 16 million passengers a year. However, in 2020, the number of passengers dropped by an estimated 70%, leaving the airport and the council reeling from the financial impact. Without ""adequate emergency funding,"" the authority warned that it will be forced to make significant cuts to essential services. The council has already begun consultations on proposed cuts to various departments, including libraries, leisure centres, and community projects. The potential closure of these facilities could have a devastating impact on the local community, particularly those who rely on them most. Luton Borough Council is not alone in its struggle. Local authorities across the country have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many facing similar financial challenges. According to the Local Government Association (LGA), English councils are facing a combined Â£8.8bn funding gap over the next year. The LGA has warned that without sufficient government support, local services could be ""decimated,"" leaving communities ""worse off."" The government has announced a Â£3.2bn support package for English councils, but many argue that it is not enough to address the scale of the crisis. Luton Borough Council, along with other local authorities, is calling for more financial assistance to prevent the need for drastic cuts to essential services. The pandemic has underscored the importance of a strong and well-funded local government. As the country begins to recover, it is crucial that councils like Luton Borough Council receive the necessary support to protect and invest in their communities. Without this, the long-term consequences could be severe. The council is urging residents to engage with the consultation process and make their voices heard. Local people can have their say on the proposed cuts by responding to the council's consultation, which is open until [insert date]. The council has also encouraged residents to write to their MPs and local councillors to express their concerns and call for greater government support.

"Sydney seaplane crash: Sharp turn 'inexplicable', operator says","The tragic seaplane crash that occurred in Sydney Harbor on the last day of 2021 claimed the lives of six individuals, leaving the world in shock and mourning. Five members of a British family and a Canadian pilot were on board, and unfortunately, there were no survivors. A preliminary report, released on Wednesday, did not draw any concrete conclusions, but new details have emerged that may shed light on the inexplicable sharp turn that the seaplane took before crashing into the water. The single-engine de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver seaplane took off from Rose Bay Seaplane Base around 3:15 p.m. local time, with clear skies and mild conditions. Witnesses reported that the aircraft appeared normal during takeoff and climb-out. However, less than five minutes into the flight, as the seaplane approached the northern end of the harbor, it made an abrupt turn to the left, banking at a steep angle. The operator of the seaplane, who has not been identified, described the turn as ""inexplicable."" He told investigators that he attempted to correct the turn but was unable to regain control of the aircraft. The engine continued to run until the seaplane hit the water, creating a large splash that attracted the attention of bystanders. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is leading the investigation into the crash. In their preliminary report, they noted that there were no distress calls from the seaplane before the crash. They also mentioned that the aircraft's engine and propeller showed no signs of malfunction. The ATSB is now focusing on the possible causes of the sharp turn. They are exploring the possibility of pilot error, system failure, or external factors, such as wind or waves. The operator's experience and training are also under scrutiny, as he had reportedly flown the same type of aircraft numerous times before without any incidents. The victims of the crash have been identified as a British couple in their 50s, their three adult children, and the Canadian pilot. The family was reportedly on a holiday trip to Australia, and the pilot was a local who had been working for the seaplane company for several years. The news of the tragedy has saddened the local community and beyond. Friends and family of the victims have expressed their condolences and shared fond memories of the deceased. The seaplane industry has also expressed its sympathies and pledged its support to the investigation. As the investigation continues, the family and friends of the victims await answers to the many questions that remain. Why did the seaplane make that sharp turn? Could it have been prevented? And most importantly, how can we ensure that such a tragedy never happens again? In the meantime, those affected by the crash are encouraged to seek support from organizations and resources that provide counseling and other services for those dealing with grief",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Demi Lovato fans organise 'get well soon' singalong,"But rather than getting angry, the fans who'd arrived at the venue got together to send a message of support and love to Demi Lovato, who'd taken ill earlier in the day. The news had spread quickly through social media, and the atmosphere at the O2 Arena in London was sombre as fans gathered, unsure of what the future held for their beloved singer. Demi Lovato was due to perform as part of her ""Tell Me You Love Me"" world tour, but the show had been postponed at the last minute due to her sudden illness. The cause was unclear, but rumours circulated among the fans, fueled by speculation on social media. Some suggested it was a relapse related to her ongoing struggles with substance abuse, while others believed it was something more minor. Regardless of the cause, the fans were determined to show their support. A spontaneous ""get well soon"" singalong broke out as they waited for updates on Lovato's condition. The fans sang her hits, from ""Give Your Heart a Break"" to ""Confident,"" their voices echoing through the vast arena. The mood was a mix of sadness and hope. There were tears, but there were also smiles as fans shared stories of how Lovato's music had helped them through tough times. For many, her music was more than just entertainment â it was a source of comfort and inspiration. One fan, 19-year-old Emily, had travelled from Birmingham to be at the concert. ""She's been there for me through some of the darkest moments of my life,"" she said, her eyes shining with tears. ""I just wanted to be here to show her that she's not alone."" Another fan, 22-year-old Tom, had come all the way from Dublin. ""She's been open about her struggles, and it's given me the courage to seek help when I needed it,"" he said. ""I just want her to know that she's not defined by her illness â she's so much more than that."" As the evening wore on, the fans continued to sing and share stories, their voices a testament to the power of music to bring people together in times of need. And while there was sadness in the air, there was also a sense of hope and determination â a determination to be there for Demi Lovato, no matter what. The singalong lasted for hours, a tribute to a singer who had touched so many lives. And as the fans left the arena, they did so with a renewed sense of hope, knowing that Demi Lovato would get through this, just as she had gotten through so many challenges before.

Coastguard rescues suspected migrants off Kent coast,"The BBC has been told some of the passengers on a boat believed to be carrying migrants phoned relatives in Calais to say they were in trouble after their vessel began to take on water off the Kent coast. Coastguard teams from Dover and Ramsgate were alerted to the incident just before 2am on Tuesday and launched a search and rescue operation in the English Channel. A helicopter from RAF Manston and several lifeboats were sent to the scene, where they located the stricken vessel about six miles north-east of Dover. The passengers, thought to number around 30, were taken aboard the lifeboats and brought to safety. They were then assessed by paramedics and taken to hospital for further treatment. The Coastguard said the boat, which was poorly constructed and overloaded, was taking in water and had lost power, leaving the passengers in a precarious situation. The incident comes just a week after 27 people were rescued from a similar vessel in the same area. In that incident, the boat was carrying people from Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, and all were taken to hospital for assessment. Migration via the English Channel has become an increasingly common occurrence in recent years, with record numbers of people making the dangerous journey from France in small boats. The UK government has come under criticism for its handling of the issue, with some accusing it of failing to provide adequate resources to prevent the crossings and to support those who make the journey. In response to the latest incident, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""I am deeply concerned by this incident and the continued attempts by criminal gangs to exploit vulnerable people by putting them in harm's way. ""We are working closely with the French authorities to prevent these dangerous journeys and to bring those responsible to justice. In the meantime, our priority is to support those who have been rescued and to provide them with the care and support they need."" The RNLI, which provides lifesaving services along the UK coast, has urged people not to make the journey in small boats, describing it as ""dangerous and unnecessary"". ""Our crews see first-hand the risks that people take when they make the decision to cross the English Channel in a small boat,"" said RNLI CEO Mark Dowie.

Warning of challenges for UK oil sector from Wood Group,"Bob Keiller, the outgoing chief executive of Wood Group, a leading oil and gas services company, has issued a stark warning that the second half of the North Sea story is going to be different from the first. He was speaking ahead of the Offshore Europe exhibition and conference in Aberdeen, which is set to attract thousands of industry professionals from around the world. Mr Keiller, who is due to retire later this year, highlighted the challenges facing the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) and the North Sea industry as a whole. He said, ""We have had an incredible first half of the North Sea story, with the discovery of large oil and gas reserves and the subsequent development of an industry that has been a significant contributor to the UK economy."" However, he added, ""The second half of the North Sea story is going to be different. We are operating in a low-price environment, and we need to adapt to that reality. We have to be more efficient, more productive, and more innovative if we are to remain competitive."" Mr Keiller also highlighted the importance of technology in helping the industry meet these challenges. He said, ""We have to embrace technology and digitalisation if we are to maximise the economic recovery from the North Sea. That means investing in new technologies, such as subsea robotics and artificial intelligence, to increase efficiency and reduce costs."" Mr Keiller also called on the UK government to provide greater certainty and stability for the industry. He said, ""We need a clear regulatory framework and a stable tax regime if we are to attract the investment needed to develop new fields and extend the life of existing ones. We also need to see progress on infrastructure projects, such as the Northern Seas Route and the Moray East wind farm, which will create new opportunities for the industry."" The Wood Group CEO also urged the industry to work together to address the challenges facing the North Sea. He said, ""This is not just about individual companies or projects. It's about the North Sea industry as a whole. We need to collaborate and share best practices if we are to maximise the economic recovery from the North Sea and secure a sustainable future for the industry."" Mr Keiller's warnings come at a crucial time for the North Sea industry. With oil prices still low and the UK government facing Brexit-related challenges, there are concerns that investment in the sector could be impacted. However, with vast reserves still to be extracted and new technologies offering the potential for increased efficiency and productivity, there is also enormous potential for the North Sea to continue to contribute to the UK economy for decades to come. As the Offshore Europe conference gets underway in Aberdeen, industry professionals will be discussing the challenges and opportunities facing the North Sea industry. With Mr Keiller's warnings ringing in their ears, they will be focusing on how the industry can adapt to the changing market conditions and secure a sustainable future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Michael Gove accuses Sussex council of 'academy fail',"In a letter sent to all East Sussex MPs, Michael Gove, the leveling up secretary, has asked them to persuade the council to ""take a more constructive position"" regarding the establishment of new academies in the county. In the strongly-worded letter, Gove criticised East Sussex County Council for ""failing actively to pursue sponsored academy solutions,"" which he believes are crucial for improving the educational prospects of children in the area. Gove's intervention comes after years of controversy surrounding the performance of schools in East Sussex. According to the latest government data, more than a third of secondary schools in the county are below the national average for progress made by pupils. This is a situation that Gove finds unacceptable and believes can be addressed through the creation of new academies. Academies are state-funded schools that are free from local authority control. They have the freedom to set their own curriculum, employ their own staff, and manage their finances. Gove argues that this autonomy allows academies to innovate and improve more effectively than schools that are subject to local authority oversight. However, East Sussex County Council has resisted calls to support the establishment of new academies, citing concerns over the potential loss of local control and the cost of converting schools to academy status. Gove, however, is unimpressed by these arguments. In his letter, he accused the council of being ""more concerned with process than outcomes,"" and of being ""more focused on protecting their own interests than those of local children."" The council's position has also drawn criticism from local education experts. Sir Peter Lampl, the chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said that ""it is essential that local authorities work constructively with the government and schools to improve educational opportunities for all children."" He added that ""the failure to do so risks leaving children in areas like East Sussex behind."" Gove's intervention is likely to intensify the debate over the role of local authorities in education. Some argue that they have a vital role to play in ensuring that schools are accountable to local communities and that resources are allocated fairly. Others, however, believe that too much local control can stifle innovation and prevent schools from making the improvements that are needed. Whatever the outcome of this latest controversy, one thing is clear: the educational prospects of children in East Sussex cannot afford to be left behind any longer. It is to be hoped that all parties will work together to find a solution that puts the interests of children first. In the meantime, Gove has promised to intervene directly if necessary, warning that ""if the council continues to obstruct efforts to improve educational standards in East Sussex, then I will take action."" Whether this threat is empty or not remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: Michael Gove is not a man to be ignored when it comes to education reform.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
The consequences of a busy day,"Nick Triggle, Health Correspondent The day before Liverpool had won the Carling Cup football final, while the Sun on Sunday had just been launched, was to be the busiest day of the year for the National Health Service (NHS). The excitement around the football match and the launch of a new newspaper had created a perfect storm of demand for health services. The emergency departments in hospitals across the country were packed with patients, many of whom had delayed seeking medical help due to the chaos caused by the football final and the new Sunday paper. The long queues and wait times only added to the frustration and anxiety of those who were already unwell. The consequences of this day were far-reaching and long-lasting. For those who had been in the emergency departments, the experience left them feeling disheartened and dissatisfied with the NHS. Many reported feeling ignored or forgotten, with staff appearing overwhelmed and under-resourced. The situation was not helped by the fact that the following day was a Monday, when the NHS typically sees a surge in demand due to people returning to work after the weekend. The backlog created by the previous day's chaos meant that wait times continued to be unacceptably long. The consequences of this day were felt not just by patients, but by the NHS staff as well. Many reported feeling demoralised and burnt out, having worked long hours to try and keep up with the demand. The lack of resources and support only added to their stress and frustration. The NHS leadership acknowledged the challenges faced that day but blamed it on a perfect storm of circumstances. They promised to learn from the experience and to invest in more resources to prevent similar situations from happening in the future. But for those who had experienced the chaos firsthand, the damage had already been done. Trust in the NHS had been eroded, and the consequences of that day continued to be felt long after the football final and the launch of the Sun on Sunday had faded from memory. The NHS was left to pick up the pieces, trying to restore faith and confidence in the health service while also addressing the root causes of the crisis. It was a tall order, but one that was essential if the NHS was to continue to provide the high-quality care that the public expected and deserved. The consequences of that day served as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the NHS and the need for continued investment and reform. It was a warning that could not be ignored, and one that would shape the health policy agenda for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Military Wives Choirs and The Hepworth Wakefield get share of Â£76m fund,"The latest raft of grants, totalling Â£76m, has been announced by Arts Council England, with a number of initiatives set to receive funding. Among those set to benefit are the Military Wives Choirs and The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery. The Military Wives Choirs, a collection of choirs made up of current and former military spouses, will receive Â£6.6m over the next four years. This funding will support the continued growth of the choirs, allowing them to reach more military communities and provide opportunities for singers to develop their skills. The Hepworth Wakefield, a contemporary art gallery and museum located in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, will receive Â£13.3m to support its expansion plans. The funding will allow the gallery to increase its exhibition space, improve its facilities for visitors, and deliver a programme of learning and engagement activities. Whitby's Gothic Festival, London's Somerset House and Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall are also set to benefit from the funding. Whitby's Gothic Festival will receive Â£1.3m to help it recover from the financial impact of the pandemic and to develop its digital offer. London's Somerset House will receive Â£10.5m to support its cultural programme, including the development of a new public art commission and a series of public events. Kneehigh Theatre in Cornwall will receive Â£7.2m to support its touring productions and to develop new work. Arts Council England's Chief Executive, Darren Henley, said: ""Arts and culture have the power to bring people together, to inspire and to heal. These investments will help to ensure that the arts continue to thrive in every corner of the country, supporting local communities and providing opportunities for people to engage with and enjoy the arts."" The funding is part of the Government's Cultural Recovery Fund, which was set up to help the cultural sector recover from the financial impact of the pandemic. The fund has so far provided over Â£1.5bn in grants and loans to over 3,500 cultural organisations and projects across the UK. The announcement of the latest round of funding comes as the cultural sector continues to face significant challenges due to the ongoing pandemic. Many organisations have had to close their doors to the public or cancel events due to restrictions, leading to significant financial losses. The funding is seen as crucial in helping the sector to recover and to continue to provide opportunities for people to engage with and enjoy the arts. The Military Wives Choirs and The Hepworth Wakefield are just two of the many organisations that will benefit from the latest round of funding. The funding will also support a range of other initiatives, including the restoration of historic theatres, the development of new digital platforms, and the creation of new public artworks.

East of England Ambulance Service vehicle staffing 'a challenge',"The East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) has announced the deployment of additional vehicles in response to patient and staff feedback, as the trust continues to grapple with staffing challenges. The new ambulances are intended to identify areas where more resources are required to ensure adequate response times and patient care. However, the trust has admitted that it will be heavily reliant on staff overtime to operate these extra vehicles. EEAST has been under immense pressure due to rising demand for emergency services, which has exacerbated existing staffing shortages. The ambulance trust serves a population of over 5.6 million people across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire. The region's demographic profile, with an aging population and numerous rural areas, makes providing an adequate ambulance response particularly challenging. In recent months, the trust has seen an average of over 5,000 calls per day, requiring the attendance of approximately 4,000 patients. To maintain the necessary response times, the EEAST has had to rely on increasing staff overtime, which, in turn, contributes to staff burnout and fatigue. As a result, the trust has taken steps to recruit and train new staff, including student paramedics and emergency medical technicians. However, the recruitment process, which involves background checks, training, and certification, can take several months. In the interim, relying on overtime for existing staff is the only viable solution. ""We are committed to providing the best possible care to our patients, and we understand the importance of having the right resources in the right place at the right time,"" said an EEAST spokesperson. ""However, the current staffing situation is challenging, and we are working tirelessly to address the shortages. In the meantime, we are grateful for the dedication and hard work of our staff, who continue to go above and beyond to ensure our patients receive the care they need."" The deployment of extra vehicles is a temporary measure, with the trust hoping to address the staffing shortages in the long term. It is also exploring alternative solutions, such as increasing partnership working with other healthcare providers and community organisations, to reduce the demand for emergency services and improve patient outcomes. As the East of England Ambulance Service continues to navigate the complexities of staffing its fleet, the commitment to providing high-quality patient care remains a priority. With ongoing efforts to recruit and retain staff, along with the use of temporary solutions, the trust remains hopeful that it will soon achieve the necessary staffing levels to meet the growing demands of its population.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK Conservatives 'row back' in Europe rights battle,"By Laurence Peter, BBC News The UK's ruling Conservatives have clashed with European judges on several high-profile cases, leading to concerns about the government's commitment to upholding human rights in Europe. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, a vocal critic of the government's approach, expressed his concerns in an interview with BBC News. ""My impression is there is a lot of rowing back,"" Dominic Grieve said. ""There's a lot of frustration from the European Court of Human Rights about the UK government's attitude towards its judgments."" The first major point of contention came in 2014 when the UK government implemented a ban on prisoners voting in parliamentary elections. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the ban was a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and called on the UK to change its legislation. The government, however, refused and the issue remains unresolved. Another high-profile case involved Abu Qatada, a radical cleric who was deported from the UK in 2013 after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that his continued presence in the UK was a violation of the rights of others. The UK government appealed the decision, but was ultimately unsuccessful. More recently, the UK government announced plans to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights, a move that has been met with criticism from human rights organizations and opposition politicians. The government argues that it wants to restore the UK's sovereignty and reduce the influence of the European Court of Human Rights. ""This is a misguided and potentially dangerous move,"" Grieve said. ""The European Convention on Human Rights is an essential safeguard for individual rights and freedoms. It is not perfect, but it is the best system we have."" The government's position has also raised concerns among other European countries, with some expressing concern about the potential for a slide towards authoritarianism in the UK. ""The European Convention on Human Rights is not just a UK issue, it is a European issue,"" Grieve said. ""If the UK starts to undermine the convention, it sends a message to other European countries that human rights can be compromised for political convenience."" Despite these concerns, the government remains committed to its course. In a statement, a spokesperson for the UK government said: ""We are committed to upholding human rights, but we also believe in restoring the UK's sovereignty. The European Convention on Human Rights is not the only way to do this, and we are exploring other options."" For now, the debate continues, with both sides dug in and unwilling to back down. The future of human rights in Europe, and in the UK in particular, remains uncertain.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of wife's murder,"Mitesh Patel, a 37-year-old pharmacist from Middlesbrough, stood before Teesside Crown Court, denying any involvement in the murder of his wife, Jessica, who was also 34. The courtroom was filled with an air of tension as the jury listened intently to the prosecution's case against him. The prosecution alleged that Patel had planned the murder meticulously, with the intention of collecting a substantial life insurance payout. It was claimed that he had taken out a policy worth Â£2 million just a few months prior to the incident. Jessica's body was discovered at the couple's home on the evening of 27th March. She had been brutally murdered, with multiple stab wounds to her chest. The scene suggested a struggle, with broken furniture and smashed ornaments scattered around the room. Initially, the police believed that the murder had been the result of a burglary gone wrong. However, as they delved deeper into the case, they began to suspect that something more sinister was at play. Patel's behaviour in the days following his wife's death raised suspicions among the investigators. In the days leading up to Jessica's death, Patel had reportedly been using the dating app Grindr, communicating with multiple men. The prosecution argued that this behaviour was out of character for Patel, who had previously been a devoted husband. Furthermore, it was revealed that Patel had been having an affair with a colleague from the pharmacy where he worked. The affair had reportedly been going on for several months, and Patel had allegedly confessed to his wife about it just a few days before her death. The prosecution argued that Patel had killed his wife in a fit of rage, after she confronted him about his infidelity. They claimed that he had staged the scene to make it look like a burglary, in an attempt to cover up his crime. Patel's defence team argued that there was no concrete evidence linking their client to the murder. They claimed that there were numerous other possible explanations for the broken furniture and smashed ornaments in the room, and that the fact that Patel had been using Grindr did not necessarily mean that he was capable of murder. As the trial continued, the jury listened to hours of testimony from witnesses, forensic experts, and psychologists. They deliberated for several hours before delivering their verdict. The courtroom erupted into chaos as the foreman of the jury read out the words ""guilty"" in relation to the charge of murder against Mitesh Patel. The defendant's face fell as he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. The trial had come to an end, but the consequences of Mitesh Patel's actions would be felt by",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tourists in trainers rescued in Ben Nevis blizzard,"In the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Ben Nevis, Scotland's highest peak, three tourists found themselves in a perilous situation. They had ventured out without adequate equipment to face the treacherous conditions that the mountain can bring. The rescuers, who were alerted to their plight, described the tourists as being ""caught in blizzard conditions with no ice axes, no crampons and as far as we are aware, no maps."" The trio, who were in their late twenties, had underestimated the challenge that Ben Nevis poses even in good weather, let alone in the midst of a blizzard. The rescue team, made up of experienced mountain rescuers, set out to locate the stranded tourists. Conditions were far from ideal, with heavy snowfall and strong winds making progress slow and difficult. The team used their expertise and knowledge of the mountain to track the tourists' movements and locate their position. As they approached the tourists, they found them huddled together for warmth, their bodies shivering from the cold. They were disoriented and exhausted, their spirits low after hours of exposure to the harsh elements. The rescue team acted quickly to administer first aid and provide them with warm clothing and food. The tourists, who were thankful for the rescue team's intervention, expressed their regret for not being better prepared. They had assumed that the weather would be fine and that they would be able to complete the hike in their trainers. However, the unpredictable nature of the mountain had caught them off guard. The incident served as a reminder to all tourists planning to tackle the challenges of Ben Nevis or any other mountain for that matter. Proper preparation is crucial, and the lack of essential equipment such as ice axes, crampons, and maps can make the difference between a successful and unsuccessful trip. The rescue team, who had saved the lives of the tourists, urged all mountain goers to take the time to prepare properly before setting out on their adventures. They emphasized the importance of checking the weather conditions, carrying the right equipment, and having a map and compass to navigate the terrain. As the tourists were safely escorted down the mountain, the rescuers couldn't help but reflect on the importance of their work. The mountains may be beautiful and majestic, but they can also be unforgiving and dangerous. Proper preparation and the right equipment are essential for all those who seek to conquer their peaks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stormont deadlock: Sinn FÃ©in to meet Leo Varadkar,"Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has announced that she will make it clear to both the British and Irish governments this week that ""direct rule from London is not an option"" as talks to restore the Stormont assembly collapsed once again. The impasse, which has lasted for over a year, has left Northern Ireland without a functioning devolved government. McDonald, who leads Sinn FÃ©in, the second-largest party in the power-sharing executive, stated that she will be meeting with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Thursday to discuss the way forward. She emphasized that her party would not accept the imposition of Westminster rule on Northern Ireland, as some have suggested as a possible solution to the deadlock. The collapse of the talks came about due to disagreements over several contentious issues, including the Irish language, same-sex marriage, and an proposed legacy mechanism for dealing with the past. Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the largest unionist party, have been unable to reach a compromise on these matters. McDonald expressed her disappointment at the failure of the talks, stating, ""The people of the North deserve better than this. They deserve a functioning Executive and Assembly. They deserve to see their politicians working together for the common good."" The DUP, however, has indicated that it will not soften its stance on the issues that have caused the deadlock. Party leader Arlene Foster has reiterated her position that the Irish language should not be given special status in Northern Ireland and that same-sex marriage should not be imposed on the region. The impasse at Stormont has left Northern Ireland in a state of political limbo, with important decisions on issues such as the budget and health care being made by civil servants rather than elected representatives. This has led to frustration and anxiety among the population, who are concerned about the potential impact on public services and the economy. The British and Irish governments have expressed their commitment to finding a solution to the crisis and have indicated that they will explore all options, including the possibility of fresh talks or the imposition of direct rule from London. However, both sides have also emphasized the need for a locally-led solution that respects the rights and interests of all communities in Northern Ireland. As the situation at Stormont remains uncertain, there is growing concern that the deadlock could continue for some time, with potentially serious consequences for the region. It is hoped that McDonald's meeting with Varadkar will provide some clarity on the way forward and help to break the deadlock.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus in NI care homes a 'critical battle' for executive,"By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter On Friday, it emerged that some residents were being moved from a north Belfast care home due to concerns about its handling of an outbreak. Almost half of the home's population had tested positive for coronavirus, prompting urgent action from health officials. This care home crisis is just one example of the critical battle being waged by the Northern Ireland Executive to protect the most vulnerable members of society from the ravages of COVID-19. The Executive has faced intense scrutiny over its handling of the pandemic in care homes, with many voices calling for more transparency and accountability. The latest figures show that over 1,300 residents and 500 staff members in care homes have contracted the virus, accounting for nearly a third of all coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland. Health Minister Robin Swann has acknowledged the challenges facing care homes, stating that ""the virus thrives in care home settings and we know that any outbreak can have a devastating impact."" He has pledged to continue working closely with the sector to provide support and guidance. However, some care home providers have expressed frustration at the lack of clear guidance and resources from the Executive. They feel that they have been left to manage the crisis on their own, with limited support from the health service. At the same time, there have been calls for more testing in care homes to identify cases early and prevent outbreaks. The Executive has announced plans to increase testing capacity, but many providers are still waiting for the resources to carry out regular testing of residents and staff. The situation is particularly challenging in homes with high numbers of vulnerable residents, such as those with dementia or learning disabilities. These residents are at greater risk from the virus and can find it difficult to follow social distancing guidelines. Despite these challenges, there are also stories of resilience and innovation in the care home sector. Some homes have implemented new measures to keep residents safe, such as using technology to enable virtual visits from family members. Others have collaborated with local community groups to provide support and resources. The Executive has also announced a Â£25m funding package for care homes to help them manage the crisis, including money for PPE, testing, and infection control measures. However, some providers have expressed concerns that this may not be enough to cover the full cost of the pandemic response. As the battle against coronavirus in care homes continues, it is clear that there are no easy answers. The Executive must provide clear guidance, resources, and support to care home providers, while also working to prevent future outbreaks through testing, social distancing, and other measures. At the same time, care home providers must continue to adapt and innovate, finding new ways to keep their residents safe and connected to their families and communities. It is a critical battle, but one that can be won with the right resources, support, and determination.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Rower, 72, set to become oldest to cross Atlantic","Graham Walters, a 72-year-old resident of Thurmaston in Leicestershire, is once again setting sail towards an extraordinary achievement. Known for his indomitable spirit and passion for rowing, Walters is preparing to embark on his fifth Atlantic crossing, this time with a remarkable goal in mind: to become the oldest person to row the Atlantic. The veteran rower's latest endeavor is not merely a personal challenge; it is an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for Help for Heroes, a charity close to his heart. Walters has set a fundraising target of Â£250,000, aiming to make a significant impact on the lives of veterans and their families. Walters' journey will begin in Gran Canaria, off the northwest coast of Africa, and conclude in Antigua, an island nation in the Caribbean. Spanning over 3,000 miles, the crossing is expected to take approximately two months to complete, assuming favorable weather conditions. ""I've always been drawn to the ocean and the challenge it presents,"" Walters explained in a recent interview. ""But this time, I want to use my passion for rowing to make a difference in the lives of those who have served our country. Help for Heroes does incredible work supporting our wounded veterans and their families, and I'm excited to do my part."" The charitable cause is not unfamiliar territory for Walters. In his previous Atlantic crossings, he has raised over Â£1.5 million for various charities, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the RAF Benevolent Fund. To prepare for his record-breaking attempt, Walters has been undergoing rigorous training, both physically and mentally. He has been spending hours on the water each day, perfecting his technique and building endurance. Additionally, he has been working with nutritionists and fitness experts to ensure he is in optimal condition for the grueling journey ahead. Despite his age, Walters remains determined and optimistic about the challenge. ""I may be 72, but I still have the fire in me to push myself to the limit,"" he said.

Seychelles protects an area 'as big as Britain' in Indian Ocean,"The Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands located in the Indian Ocean, has made a significant move towards preserving its marine environment. In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off, the island nation has agreed to protect an area of ocean that is almost as large as Britain. The reserves, which will be the largest of their kind in the world, will limit tourism and fishing in the designated zone. The Seychelles government announced the establishment of the Seychelles' Maritime Spatial Plan (MSP), which includes the protection of 210,000 square kilometers (81,000 square miles) of the Indian Ocean. This ambitious project will see the creation of a marine protected area (MPA) that is larger than the total land area of the Seychelles. The MPA will cover approximately 30% of the country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Seychelles' decision to protect such a vast area of ocean is a testament to the country's commitment to marine conservation. The MPA will limit tourism activities such as fishing, oil exploration, and mining in the designated zone. The government has stated that it will work closely with international organizations to ensure the effective implementation of the MPA. The Seychelles' MPA is expected to have a positive impact on the marine ecosystem, which is home to over 1,000 species of fish, 75 species of sharks and rays, and 150 species of coral. The MPA will also help protect endangered species such as the hawksbill turtle, green turtle, and the whale shark. The Seychelles' MPA is part of a larger initiative called the Blue Belt Program. The program aims to create a network of MPAs around the Indian Ocean, which will help protect the marine ecosystem and promote sustainable tourism. The Seychelles joins other countries such as Mauritius, Madagascar, and the Maldives in this ambitious initiative. The Seychelles' MPA is not without its challenges. The country's economy heavily relies on tourism and fishing, and the implementation of the MPA may have economic implications. However, the Seychelles government is confident that the benefits of marine conservation will outweigh the costs. The Seychelles' decision to protect a large area of ocean is an important step towards preserving the marine ecosystem in the Indian Ocean. The MPA will help protect endangered species, promote sustainable tourism, and contribute to global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. The Seychelles' MPA is a model for other countries to follow in preserving their marine resources for future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rise in ambulance delays at South East hospitals,"South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAmb) figures reveal a concerning trend in prolonged handover times at hospitals in the South East, with data from 2011/12 indicating that ambulances accumulated a total of 36,000 hours in handover delays â a 50% increase compared to three years prior. This situation has raised serious alarm among healthcare professionals, including the College of Paramedics, who have warned that these extended waits pose a significant risk to patient safety. Handover delays occur when ambulance crews are forced to wait outside hospitals before transferring their patients into the care of hospital staff. These hold-ups not only stretch resources thin but also mean that critically ill or injured patients are kept in an ambulance for longer periods than necessary. The College of Paramedics, which represents the professional interests of paramedics and student paramedics, has issued a stern warning over the escalating problem. ""Handover delays not only impact the ability of ambulance services to respond to new 999 calls but also put patient safety at risk,"" said Chris Manning, the Chief Executive of the College of Paramedics. ""It is crucial that hospitals work collaboratively with ambulance services to address this issue and ensure that patients receive timely, effective care."" SECAmb has attributed the rise in handover delays to a combination of factors, including bed blockages and a surge in demand for hospital services. The ambulance service has also highlighted the need for hospitals to increase their capacity to admit and treat patients more efficiently, as well as for the health system as a whole to address underlying issues that contribute to lengthy handover waits. The consequences of handover delays can be severe, including worsening health conditions for patients and increased pressure on already strained ambulance services. In extreme cases, prolonged waits for care can even result in fatalities. Furthermore, the psychological impact on ambulance crews, who witness the deteriorating condition of their patients while they wait for hospital staff to become available, can be detrimental to their mental and emotional wellbeing. The South East Ambulance Foundation Trust has called upon the government, NHS trusts, and local health authorities to take immediate action in addressing the root causes of handover delays and improving patient care in hospitals. ""We are committed to working with our NHS partners to find solutions to this problem and ensure that our patients receive the timely, effective care they deserve,"" said SECAmb's Director of Operations, Geraint Davies. As the situation continues to unfold, it is essential that all stakeholders in the healthcare system collaborate to find lasting solutions to the escalating problem of handover delays and prioritize patient safety above all else.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina resigns,"Prosecutors accuse Mr Otto Perez Molina of masterminding a complex scheme to defraud Guatemala's customs service of millions of dollars. He denies the allegations, but on Tuesday, the president of this Central American country tendered his resignation, effective from midnight. The announcement came after weeks of mounting pressure on Perez Molina, who had initially refused to step down despite being indicted on charges of corruption and organized crime. His resignation was confirmed by Vice President Billy Sagastume, who will take over as interim president until new elections are held. The allegations against Perez Molina involve a network of businesses and politicians colluding to evade customs duties on imported goods. Prosecutors allege that the president received bribes in exchange for turning a blind eye to the illegal activities. The scheme is believed to have cost the Guatemalan government millions of dollars in lost revenue. The president's downfall marks a dramatic turn of events in a country that has long struggled to combat corruption and organized crime. Perez Molina, a former military general, was elected in 2012 on a promise to tackle these issues. However, his tenure has been marred by a series of scandals, including allegations of human rights abuses and links to drug trafficking. The announcement of Perez Molina's resignation was met with celebrations in the streets of Guatemala City, where thousands of people gathered to demand his removal. The opposition political parties have called for new elections to be held as soon as possible, and there are concerns that the instability caused by the president's resignation could lead to violence. The international community has also reacted with shock to the developments in Guatemala. The United States, which is a major donor to the country, has urged all parties to respect the rule of law and ensure a peaceful transition of power. The European Union has also expressed its concern and called for new elections to be held in a timely and transparent manner. With the resignation of Perez Molina, Guatemala faces a period of uncertainty. The country needs strong and effective leadership to tackle the challenges it faces, including poverty, crime, and corruption. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether Guatemala can move forward and leave behind the dark chapter of its recent history. In the meantime, the interim president, Billy Sagastume, has promised to restore stability and begin the process of healing the deep divisions that have emerged in Guatemalan society. The challenge will be great, but with the support of the international community and the determination of the Guatemalan people, there is hope that a brighter future can be achieved.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
MP Nigel Evans sex abuse trial hears 'Benny Hill' claim,"The Ribble Valley MP, Nigel Evans, faced further scrutiny in court on Monday as the sex abuse trial against him continued. The claims against Evans, which include allegations of indecent assault and sexual touching, have left his political career in limbo. During cross-examination by the prosecution, Evans strongly denied the accusations, calling them ""ridiculous."" He spoke of his disappointment that the claims had effectively ended his ambitions of becoming House of Commons Speaker, a position he had long coveted. ""I have dedicated my life to public service,"" Evans told the court. ""To have these baseless allegations tarnish my reputation is deeply frustrating and upsetting."" The court heard evidence from a witness who claimed that Evans had made inappropriate comments and gestures towards him during a drunken incident in 2011. The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, testified that he had been at a party with Evans and several other people when the MP made the comments. The witness described Evans as making a ""Benny Hill"" gesture, a reference to the popular British comedy series known for its crude humor and innuendo. The gesture, which involves making a chasing motion with the fingers, has long been associated with sexually suggestive behavior. Evans' defense team questioned the credibility of the witness, arguing that his memory of the incident was vague and that he had not reported it to the police until several years later. The defense also pointed out that the witness had previously made statements to the media that contradicted his court testimony. The trial, which is expected to last several more days, has been a closely watched event in British politics. Evans, who has been an MP since 2001, has previously been a prominent figure in the Conservative Party and has held several high-profile roles within the government. Despite his denials, the allegations have cast a shadow over his political career. If found guilty, Evans could face a lengthy prison sentence and be expelled from the Conservative Party. Outside the court, Evans' supporters rallied to his defense, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"" and a ""smear campaign."" They expressed their belief that Evans was being targeted unfairly and demanded that the truth be brought to light. As the trial continues, both sides will present their evidence and arguments in an effort to sway the jury's decision.

Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore',"Ms Kuria, who met with Europe's aviation watchdog on Wednesday, expressed her deep concerns about Boeing's reliability, stating, ""I wouldn't even use the word trust anywhere near Boeing."" Her remarks came as the 737 Max, Boeing's troubled jet model, remains grounded following two fatal crashes within five months of each other. Boeing is currently in damage control mode, trying to reassure the public and aviation authorities that they are taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of their aircraft. A company spokesman responded to Ms Kuria's comments, saying, ""We understand the concerns raised by Ms Kuria and others, but we want to emphasize that Boeing is fully committed to making things right."" However, the trust that Boeing once enjoyed within the aviation industry has been significantly eroded. The crashes of the 737 Max, which killed a combined total of 346 people, have highlighted a culture of prioritizing profits over safety. The jet's automated flight control system, known as MCAS, was found to be a major contributing factor in both crashes. Boeing failed to adequately disclose this system to pilots and regulators, leading to a lack of understanding and proper training. The revelation that Boeing had not provided complete and accurate information about the 737 Max to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulatory bodies has further damaged Boeing's reputation. The FAA has since faced criticism for its oversight role in the certification of the 737 Max. Boeing's efforts to regain trust have been hindered by a series of missteps. First, the company initially downplayed the extent of the 737 Max's problems, insisting that the crashes were isolated incidents. They have also been slow to provide clear and detailed information about the causes of the crashes and how they plan to address the underlying issues. Additionally, Boeing's handling of the situation has been criticized for being insensitive to the victims and their families. The company's initial response to the crashes was seen as tone-deaf, with executives focusing on the commercial implications rather than expressing genuine concern for the human cost. In the face of such public skepticism, Boeing faces an uphill battle to regain the trust of aviation authorities, passengers, and the industry as a whole. The company must fully address the issues with the 737 Max and be transparent about its actions. They must also demonstrate a renewed commitment to safety and ethical business practices. Only then can Boeing hope to restore its reputation and move past this crisis. In conclusion, Boeing's reputation has been severely damaged following the grounding of the 737 Max, with many questioning the company's commitment to safety and trustworthiness.

Peter Sutcliffe victim highlights 'imbalance of justice' for women,"Mo Lea, a 61-year-old woman from Bedford, was an art student in Leeds in 1980 when her life was altered forever. She has been named as one of the likely victims of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, a serial killer who preyed on women in the northern English city during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The memories of that fateful night still haunt Mo. It was a warm summer evening, and she was walking home from a friend's house when a man appeared out of the shadows. He attacked her with a hammer, leaving her for dead in an alleyway. Mo was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries, including a fractured skull and broken ribs. Mo's attack came just weeks after the murder of Jacqueline Hill, a 20-year-old student whose body was found in a canal in Leeds. Sutcliffe was later convicted of her murder, along with 13 others, and was sentenced to life in prison. But Mo's ordeal did not end with her attack. She was left with physical and emotional scars that have stayed with her for over four decades. She has spent years dealing with the trauma, undergoing therapy and trying to put her life back together. Mo's experience highlights the imbalance of justice that women faced during that time. Sutcliffe was a prolific killer, preying on women who were often alone and vulnerable. Yet, the police and the media focused on the victims, rather than the perpetrator. They were portrayed as sex workers or prostitutes, even though many were not. Mo, like many other victims, was stigmatized and blamed for her attack. She was asked intrusive questions about her personal life, and her name was published in the press. Her attack was used as evidence against Sutcliffe, rather than as a reason to increase police resources and protection for women. The aftermath of the attacks left many women feeling unsafe and powerless. They were advised to avoid walking alone at night, to stay indoors, and to carry pepper spray or other self-defense weapons. The fear of being attacked by a stranger was a constant presence in their lives. Today, Mo is an advocate for women's rights and safety. She speaks out about the importance of believing victims and providing them with the support they need. She hopes that the lessons learned from the Yorkshire Ripper case will be applied to future cases, and that women will no longer be blamed for the actions of their attackers. Mo's story is a reminder of the importance of addressing the root causes of violence against women, rather than blaming the victims. It is a call to action for all of us to work towards creating a world where women are safe and valued, and where justice is truly impartial.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Greggs profits set to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels,"The bakery chain, Greggs, reported a ""strong recovery"" in sales since non-essential shops reopened in April, signaling a potential bounce back to pre-pandemic profit levels. Despite the uncertain trading conditions that continue to be ""highly unusual"" due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the company remains optimistic about its financial outlook for the year. Greggs' interim results for the 26 weeks ended July 3, 2021, revealed a 5.9% increase in total sales to Â£488.4m, driven primarily by the reopening of its shops. In the first half of the year, the company saw a strong performance from its retail division, with sales up 11.5% compared to the same period in 2020. The Food-to-Go sales channel, which accounts for around 80% of its total sales, experienced a 12.5% increase in sales during the first half. The company attributed the sales growth to a combination of factors, including the reopening of its shops, strong consumer demand for its products, and the expansion of its delivery and collection services. Greggs' digital channels, including its app and website, have also contributed significantly to the sales growth, with digital sales up 174.5% compared to the same period in 2020. Despite the positive sales figures, Greggs cautioned that trading conditions remain uncertain, with ongoing disruption to global supply chains and labor shortages posing challenges to its operations. The company also reiterated its commitment to investing in its digital capabilities, including the expansion of its delivery services, and in its shop estate, as it continues to focus on growth. In light of the strong sales performance, Greggs raised its full-year profit forecast from Â£33m to Â£50m, representing a significant increase from its previous forecast. The company's interim dividend was also increased to 1.5p per share, up from the previous interim dividend of 0.8p per share. In a statement, Roger Whiteside, the CEO of Greggs, said, ""We are pleased with the strong recovery in sales since the reopening of our shops, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for the business. However, we continue to face significant operational challenges, and our priority remains the health and wellbeing of our people, as well as our customers and suppliers."" Overall, Greggs' strong sales performance and increased profit forecast offer a positive indication of the bakery chain's ability to bounce back from the pandemic. However, the company's cautious tone highlights the ongoing challenges and uncertainties facing the retail sector as a whole.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid-19: Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry move into tier 2,"Restrictions in the English cities of Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry heightened significantly as they moved into tier 2 of the coronavirus alert system at 00:01 BST on Saturday. Slough, another town in Berkshire, joined them in this category. The new measures, introduced by the UK government in response to rising COVID-19 infection rates, mean households can no longer mix indoors. This rule applies to private homes, gardens, and other indoor venues. The exceptions include support bubbles, childcare, and tradespeople carrying out essential work. In the community setting, the rule of six still applies for outdoor gatherings, while hospitality venues such as bars, restaurants, and pubs must close unless they are serving substantial meals. In such establishments, customers must order, eat, and drink while seated, and groups are limited to a maximum of six people. In Stoke-on-Trent, city council leader Abdirahman Hassan acknowledged the challenges ahead. He stated that the city's residents must continue to follow public health guidelines to protect themselves and their communities. Hassan urged everyone to ""stick together"" and ""look out for each other."" In Coventry, the leader of the council, George Duggins, shared similar sentiments. He called on residents to ""make the necessary sacrifices"" and to ""do their part to help save lives."" Duggins emphasized the importance of adhering to the new restrictions and offered reassurance that the city council would continue to provide support and guidance to residents during these challenging times. Several other areas in the Midlands, such as Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Worcestershire, have also been moved into tier 2. The mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed his disappointment at the city's move back into tier 2, stating that it was a ""setback"" for the community. However, he urged Leicester residents to remain resilient and to continue following public health guidelines to help turn the situation around. The new tier 2 restrictions are expected to remain in place for at least two weeks, with regular reviews to assess the situation and consider any necessary adjustments. The UK government has emphasized that the introduction of these measures is a necessary response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases and is intended to prevent further infection and save lives. As Stoke-on-Trent, Coventry, Slough, and other areas face the challenges of tier 2 restrictions, residents are urged to follow the guidelines carefully, look out for one another, and continue to prioritize public health and safety. The hope is that, by working together, these communities can help control the spread of COVID-19 and move towards a safer and healthier future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Budget 2020: The chancellor's very large cheque book,"Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurakun: Rishi Sunak has barely been in one of the biggest jobs in the country for a month. But the chancellor certainly found his stride as the astonishing scale of the government's first Budget became clear. With a spending review just around the corner, Sunak wasted no time in announcing a series of eye-catching measures designed to stimulate the economy amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The chancellor's very large chequebook was on full display as he pledged billions to protect jobs, support businesses, and cushion the blow of the pandemic. Sunak's announcement of a Â£30 billion emergency package, aimed at shielding the economy from the worst effects of the virus, marked the largest intervention in the economy since the 2008 financial crisis. The centrepiece of the Budget was the government's plan to pay the wages of furloughed workers up to Â£2,500 a month, a move that is expected to benefit around 6 million workers across the UK. Sunak also unveiled a raft of business support measures, including grants for small businesses, a bounce-back loan scheme, and tax deferrals for self-employed individuals. ""This is a Budget of action, a Budget for the British people,"" Sunak declared as he delivered his statement to the House of Commons. ""We will get through this, and we will get through it together."" The chancellor's measures were welcomed by business groups and opposition politicians alike, with many expressing relief at the scale of the government's response to the crisis. However, concerns have been raised about the long-term impact of the spending spree on the country's public finances. Sunak acknowledged the potential for higher borrowing and debt, but argued that the government must act now to protect jobs and businesses. ""I'm not going to pretend that this Budget will fix all of the problems we face,"" he conceded. ""But I believe that the measures I've announced today will provide a safety net for millions of people, and give businesses the confidence they need to get through this crisis and plan for the future."" As the UK enters a period of uncertainty, Sunak's bold measures are a clear signal that the government is determined to do whatever it takes to support the economy and protect livelihoods during these challenging times. Whether the chancellor's gambit will pay off remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the UK is about to embark on an unprecedented spending spree.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Astronaut Scott Kelly attacked for quoting Winston Churchill,"American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes during a social media exchange landed him in hot water with people. In a tweet, Kelly shared a quote from the legendary British prime minister, writing, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" He attached a photograph of himself floating in space, with the Earth visible through the cupola window of the International Space Station. The post seemed innocuous enough, but it sparked a heated debate among Kelly's followers. Some appreciated the inspirational message and praised the astronaut for his courage and resilience. Others, however, took issue with the quote itself, arguing that it was plagiarized or that Churchill never actually said those words. The controversy escalated when a user named ""Mike D"" replied to Kelly's tweet, accusing him of fabricating the quote and demanding an apology. ""Scott, this is a false attribution,"" Mike D wrote. ""Please retract your tweet and apologize to the public for misleading them with this false quote."" Kelly responded calmly, explaining that he had seen the quote attributed to Churchill many times before and had assumed it was accurate. He also pointed out that there were many versions of the quote, some of which attributed it to other figures such as Calvin Coolidge or Mahatma Gandhi. Despite Kelly's explanation, the situation continued to escalate. Some users accused him of being a liar or a plagiarist, while others defended him and criticized the accusers for their aggression and lack of context. The debate even drew the attention of fact-checking websites, which confirmed that while the quote was not originally attributed to Churchill, it had become a popular inspirational phrase that was often associated with him. In the midst of the controversy, Kelly remained calm and professional, continuing to engage with his followers and defend his use of the quote. He also shared a link to a fact-checking article and apologized if anyone had been misled. The incident highlights the power of social media and the importance of fact-checking in the digital age. It also underscores the need for civility and respect in online discourse, particularly when it comes to issues of attribution and authenticity. Despite the controversy, Kelly's tweet continued to inspire and motivate people around the world. The quote, whatever its origins, served as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and resilience, both in space exploration and in life. As Churchill himself might have said, ""We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Shrewsbury 24': MPs vote for release of government papers,"Campaigners want to quash convictions against 24 men who were accused of violent picketing and intimidating workers in Shropshire, in a case known as the Shrewsbury 24. This long-running legal dispute, which dates back to the 1970s, has once again come to the forefront of public attention due to renewed calls for justice. On 11th November 2021, MPs voted in favour of releasing government papers related to the case, in the hope that new evidence may come to light and potentially overturn the convictions. The decision was made following a debate in Westminster Hall, which saw cross-party support for the cause. The men, who were primarily trade union activists, were arrested and charged after a series of disputes between workers at a private construction firm and their union, the National Union of Building Workers (NUBW). The incidents took place during the height of the industrial unrest in the UK, with the country experiencing a wave of strikes and labour disputes. The men were tried at Shrewsbury Crown Court in 1973 and 1974, with many of them receiving lengthy prison sentences. The convictions were based on the testimony of undercover police officers, who infiltrated the union and provided evidence against the men. However, concerns have been raised about the reliability of this evidence, with some suggesting that the officers may have fabricated or exaggerated incidents to secure convictions. The Shrewsbury 24 case has long been a contentious issue, with many believing that the men were wrongly convicted due to their union activism. Campaigners argue that the men were simply trying to protect the rights and interests of their fellow workers, and that their actions were not violent or intimidating in nature. The release of government papers could potentially shed new light on the case and provide evidence that could help overturn the convictions. The papers are believed to contain documents relating to the police investigation and the trials, as well as correspondence between government officials and other parties involved in the case. The campaign for justice for the Shrewsbury 24 has gained significant momentum in recent years, with high-profile supporters including actor Michael Sheen and musician Billy Bragg. The case has also been the subject of documentaries and books, highlighting the injustice that the men suffered and the continued fight for their vindication. As MPs call for the release of government papers related to the Shrewsbury 24 case, there is renewed hope that the truth may finally come to light and that these men, who have spent decades fighting for justice, may finally receive the recognition they deserve. The decision to release the papers is a significant step towards ensuring that the truth of this historical case is revealed, and could potentially lead to a posthumous pardon for those wrongly convicted.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail,"Maplin, the UK's largest electronics retailer, announced on Wednesday that rescue talks with potential buyers had collapsed, leaving the company with no choice but to enter into a formal insolvency process. The news came as a blow to the high street chain, which has more than 200 stores and employs around 2,300 staff. The retailer, which has been struggling with debts and declining sales, had been in urgent talks with potential buyers in a bid to secure a rescue deal and avoid administration. However, these efforts proved unsuccessful, leaving Maplin with no other option but to begin the insolvency process. The company, which was founded in 1972, has been hit hard by a number of challenges in recent years. The slump in the pound following the Brexit vote has made it more expensive for the business to import goods from abroad, while weak consumer confidence has led to a decline in sales. Additionally, the withdrawal of key suppliers has left Maplin struggling to stock its shelves with popular items. Despite these challenges, Maplin will continue to trade through the insolvency process in the hopes of securing a buyer. The company's administrators, KPMG, will now begin the process of finding a buyer for the business and its assets. This could involve selling off individual stores or the entire business to another retailer or investor. However, the prospects for a successful sale are uncertain, given the challenging retail environment and the financial struggles of many high street chains. In recent years, a number of well-known retailers, including Toys R Us and BHS, have collapsed into administration, leaving thousands of employees out of work. The collapse of Maplin is also likely to have wider implications for the UK retail sector, which has been struggling with declining sales and rising expenses. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned that the sector is facing its toughest trading conditions in decades, with rising costs, weak consumer confidence, and increasing competition from online retailers. The failure of Maplin to find a buyer is a further reminder of the challenges facing the UK high street, and the need for urgent action to support struggling retailers and help them adapt to the changing retail landscape. This could involve measures such as business rate reforms, investment in digital technology, and support for local high streets to help them become more attractive to shoppers. In the meantime, Maplin employees and suppliers are left uncertain about their future, as the company enters into the insolvency process. The collapse of the retailer is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the UK high street, and the need for urgent action to support struggling businesses and help them adapt to the changing retail landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Colchester Hospital: Police launch formal inquiry,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) report, released earlier this month, revealed concerning findings about Colchester Hospital. The regulatory body stated that staff at the hospital were ""pressured or bullied"" into changing data, raising serious concerns about the integrity of patient records and potential impact on patient care. In response to these allegations, Essex Police announced on Tuesday that they would be launching a formal investigation into the matter. NHS England, which is responsible for overseeing the management of the hospital, also expressed its commitment to cooperating fully with the police inquiry. The CQC report detailed several cases where staff reported being pressurised to amend patient data, often due to targets and performance indicators. The report highlighted that this behaviour could potentially compromise patient safety and reduce the quality of care provided. The revelations came as a shock to many, given the importance of accurate patient records in ensuring effective and safe care. The CQC's Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Prof Ted Baker, stated that the findings were ""very serious"" and required urgent action. Essex Police have confirmed that they will be conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations, with a particular focus on potential breaches of data protection laws and professional standards. The force has urged anyone with information to come forward and contact them. The hospital's chief executive, Bob Fitzsimmons, issued a statement expressing his disappointment and concern over the allegations. He reiterated the trust's commitment to improving patient care and working with regulatory bodies and the police to address any shortcomings. The news of the investigation has raised concerns among patients and their families, many of whom have expressed frustration and anxiety about the potential implications for their loved ones' care. Some have called for transparency and regular updates from the hospital and the authorities. The CQC report also highlighted other areas of concern, including waiting times, cleanliness, and the availability of staff. The trust has pledged to address these issues and has set out a plan for improvement, which includes recruiting additional staff and investing in training and development. The investigation is expected to take several weeks, during which time the hospital will continue to operate as normal. The trust has assured patients that their care will not be affected, and that they will be kept informed of any developments. The events at Colchester Hospital serve as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in the healthcare sector. The investigation will no doubt shed light on the extent of the alleged wrongdoing and the actions taken to address it. In the meantime, patients, their families, and the wider community will be watching closely to see how the situation is handled.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tidal energy project proposed off Bardsey Island,"In the rugged and picturesque landscape of North Wales, the shores of Bardsey Island have long been known for their natural beauty and rich marine life. Now, this idyllic setting is set to become the site of an innovative and groundbreaking tidal energy project. Local community enterprise YnNi Llyn, in collaboration with Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation, has announced plans to explore the possibility of deploying a 3MW array of tidal stream generators off the coast of Bardsey Island. This exciting development comes as part of a larger commitment to harnessing the untapped potential of Wales' natural resources and reducing the country's carbon footprint. The project, which is still in its early stages, has the potential to generate enough clean and renewable energy to power thousands of homes in the region. Nova Innovation, a leading player in the tidal energy sector, brings a wealth of expertise to the table. The company has already successfully deployed several tidal arrays in Scotland, including the world's first commercial tidal array in the Shetland Islands. This experience and knowledge will be invaluable in navigating the challenges of deploying a tidal array off the coast of Bardsey Island. For YnNi Llyn, this partnership represents an opportunity to bring renewable energy production back to the local community. As a community enterprise, YnNi Llyn is committed to providing affordable and sustainable energy to its members, as well as creating local jobs and economic opportunities. The tidal energy project could help achieve these goals, while also contributing to the broader transition to a low-carbon economy. The proposed tidal array would be located in the tidal race that forms around Bardsey Island. This area is known for its strong tidal currents, which offer significant potential for generating renewable energy. The generators would be submerged in the sea and would work by harnessing the kinetic energy of the moving water to generate electricity. The project is still in the planning stages, and there are several challenges that need to be addressed before construction can begin. These include securing the necessary permits, conducting environmental impact assessments, and designing and building the generators themselves. However, the partners are optimistic about the project's prospects and are committed to working closely with local stakeholders to address any concerns and ensure that the project is carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner. The tidal energy project off Bardsey Island represents an exciting opportunity for the local community, and for the wider renewable energy sector in Wales. It could help reduce the region's reliance on fossil fuels, create local jobs and economic opportunities, and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future for all. As the project moves forward, YnNi Llyn and Nova Innovation will continue to work closely together to bring this vision to life and harness the power of the sea to produce clean and renewable energy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Why Indiaâs mobile users go offline for video,"By Prasanto K Roy, Technology writer In the labyrinthine bylanes of Kolkata's Burrabazar, the city's largest wholesale market, Asim Mandal, 26, hunches over a table laden with DVDs, each containing up to ten movies of questionable quality. The sun filters through the makeshift roof of corrugated tin sheets, casting long shadows over the maze of stalls. In the digital age, why do young Indians like Asim continue to frequent physical DVD stores? The answer lies in the intermittent and often frustrating nature of India's mobile internet. India is the world's second-largest smartphone market, with over 500 million users. Yet, the country's mobile data speeds remain among the slowest in the world. According to a recent report, India ranks 137th in mobile internet speed, lagging behind countries like Nepal, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The primary reason for India's poor mobile internet performance is the lack of adequate infrastructure. India's telecom sector is fragmented, with hundreds of small and regional players competing against each other. This competition has led to intense price wars, forcing companies to compromise on network quality. Moreover, India's vast population and vast terrain make it a challenging market for telecom companies. The country's rural areas, which account for over 60% of the population, remain underserved, with limited or no mobile internet coverage. As a result, many Indians, especially those in urban areas, rely on Wi-Fi networks for their digital needs. However, access to reliable Wi-Fi is not universally available, leading to frequent online disconnections and buffering. This is where DVDs come in. Asim and his peers turn to DVDs for their entertainment needs, especially when they cannot access the internet. ""I can watch a DVD anytime, anywhere, without worrying about my data or the internet connection,"" Asim says. ""And I don't have to pay for each movie I watch. I pay for the DVD once, and I can watch it as many times as I want."" The DVD market in India is estimated to be worth over $3 billion, with millions of copies sold every year. According to a report by FICCI, the Indian Motion Picture Industry, the DVD market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% between 2020 and 2025. Despite the convenience and affordability of DVDs, the Indian telecom industry is making efforts to improve mobile internet connectivity. The government has launched several initiatives to boost broadband penetration, including setting up of the National Optic Fibre Network (NOFN) and the Digital India campaign. Telecom companies are also investing in 4G and 5G networks to provide faster mobile internet",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hospital funding issues put local MPs on the spot,"Patrick Burns, Political editor, Midlands The irony is that the private finance initiative (PFI), a scheme devised by the previous Conservative administration to help alleviate the strain on public funding for infrastructure projects, has become the very issue causing headaches for local MPs in the Midlands. As hospitals in the region grapple with funding pressures and the need for essential maintenance and upgrades, the spotlight has turned to the long-term financial implications of PFI contracts. The latest in a series of revelations came this week when it was announced that the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which serves over 1.1 million people in Birmingham, Solihull, and the surrounding areas, would be required to pay an eye-watering Â£133 million over the next five years to maintain its hospitals. This figure, which represents a 12% increase from the previous five-year period, is a stark reminder of the financial obligations that come with PFI deals. The trust's chief executive, Mark Goldstein, acknowledged the challenge but emphasized the importance of investing in the hospitals to ensure high-quality patient care. The trust operates five hospitals under PFI deals, including Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Heartlands Hospital in Bordesley Green, Solihull Hospital, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The situation has put local MPs in a difficult position. They are faced with the responsibility of representing the best interests of their constituents while navigating the complexities of PFI contracts. In a rare display of cross-party unity, both Conservative and Labour MPs have called for greater transparency and accountability in the way these deals are managed. However, the issue is not as straightforward as it may seem. PFI deals can provide significant benefits, such as the transfer of risk from the public sector to the private sector, as well as the injection of private capital to fund much-needed projects. But they also come with long-term financial commitments and can be inflexible when it comes to changes in circumstances or requirements. As the debate continues, the focus will be on finding a fair and sustainable solution to the challenges facing hospitals in the Midlands and across the country. Some have called for a review of PFI contracts, while others argue for a more collaborative approach between the public and private sectors. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the PFI issue is far from resolved. Local MPs will continue to face difficult questions from their constituents, and the financial implications of these deals will remain a contentious issue in the political landscape. As the debate rages on, it is essential that all parties â from government ministers to hospital trusts and local MPs â work together to find a solution that puts the needs of patients first and ensures the long-term viability of our healthcare system. Only then can we hope to overcome the challenges posed by hospital funding issues and the legacy of PFI deals. ",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Scotland's economy grows by 0.1%,"The GDP (gross domestic product) figures for the second quarter were down from the 0.6% growth at the start of 2017. Scotland's first quarter figures were above the equivalent rate for the UK as a whole (0.2%), offering a glimmer of hope for the Scottish economy. However, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals a more subdued growth rate. Despite this setback, there are signs of resilience in Scotland's economy. The service sector, which accounts for around 75% of Scotland's GDP, expanded over the quarter, albeit at a slower pace than previously. The manufacturing sector also showed a slight expansion, with growth driven by the production of pharmaceuticals and food products. However, there are concerns that Scotland's economic growth may not be sustained in the face of global economic headwinds and domestic political uncertainty. The ongoing Brexit negotiations continue to cast a shadow over the Scottish economy, with uncertainty surrounding the future trade relationship between the UK and the EU. Additionally, Scotland's public finances remain a source of concern. While the Scottish Government's budget deficit has been reduced in recent years, it remains significantly larger than the UK average. The Scottish Government's reliance on North Sea oil revenues, which have been in decline due to low oil prices, has also added to the challenges. Despite these challenges, there are areas of strength in Scotland's economy. The country's education system continues to produce a highly skilled workforce, while its renewable energy sector is growing rapidly. Scotland is also home to a thriving financial services sector, with Edinburgh often referred to as the 'Athens of the North'. In conclusion, while Scotland's economy grew by 0.1% in the second quarter, there are challenges on the horizon. The ongoing Brexit negotiations and concerns over public finances pose risks to the Scottish economy. However, there are also areas of strength, including the service sector and renewable energy, which offer grounds for optimism. The Scottish Government will need to navigate these challenges carefully to ensure sustainable economic growth in the years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Michael Gove 'shuddered' at UKIP migrants poster,"The justice secretary, Michael Gove, joined a chorus of politicians attacking the UK Independence Party (UKIP) migrants poster on Tuesday, with George Osborne going as far as drawing parallels to 1930s literature. The contentious poster, which features a photograph taken in Slovenia, depicts a long line of Syrian refugees queuing to enter Europe, with the caption ""Breaking Point: The EU has failed us. Now it's our turn to act."" Gove, who previously served as the UK's chief whip and education secretary, expressed his disapproval during an interview on LBC radio. ""I think it's important that we don't use language or imagery that is designed to inflame prejudice and incite fear,"" he stated, adding that such rhetoric doesn't help to create a welcoming environment for refugees. The Conservative Party member's criticism was swiftly followed by that of his former colleague and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Osborne, who resigned from his post in the aftermath of Theresa May's election victory, expressed his disapproval of the poster during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today program. ""I think it does have echoes of some of the literature from the 1930s,"" he warned, alluding to the divisive nature of the imagery and language used in the poster. Despite the growing criticism, UKIP leader Nigel Farage defended the poster, insisting that it accurately represents the challenges facing Europe in the wake of the refugee crisis. ""This is the reality of the situation,"" he argued during an interview with Sky News. ""People are genuinely concerned about the numbers coming into this country and the pressure that it puts on public services and the economy."" However, Farage's comments were met with skepticism from many quarters, with some accusing him of peddling fear and division for political gain. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been a vocal critic of the UK government's response to the refugee crisis, expressed his disapproval of the poster during a speech in London. ""This is not about refugees, it's about people trying to stoke up fear and division for political purposes,"" he stated, adding that the UK has a moral duty to help those in need. As the controversy continued to dominate headlines, many questioned whether the poster represented a turning point in the UK's approach to the refugee crisis, or whether it was simply a cynical ploy to garner support for UKIP ahead of the upcoming local elections. Regardless of the motivation, one thing was clear: the debate over the UK's response to the refugee crisis was set to continue, with both sides showing no signs of backing down.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
India PM Narendra Modi warning about religious attacks,"By Sanjoy Majumder, BBC News In one instance, a Catholic church was burned down in a suburb of the Indian capital New Delhi, amid a wave of violence that has left at least three people dead and over 400 injured. The disturbances, which began on Sunday, have sparked concerns about religious tensions in India, with some commentators drawing parallels to the 2002 Gujarat riots that occurred during Narendra Modi's tenure as chief minister. Mr Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, has condemned the violence and warned against religious attacks. In a statement, he said, ""I want to assure my sisters and brothers of the Christian community that the government will ensure the safety, security and well-being of all citizens."" The violence began after a rumour spread that a young Hindu woman had been kidnapped and forced to convert to Christianity. The rumour was later found to be false, but it was enough to ignite tensions in several parts of Delhi, as well as in nearby Haryana and Uttar Pradesh states. The violence has upset India's Christian community, which makes up just over 2% of the country's population. They have expressed their concern about what they see as a growing intolerance towards religious minorities in India. ""We are deeply disturbed by the incidents of violence against Christian communities in several parts of the country,"" said Mathew Vattamattam, the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. ""We urge the government to take swift and decisive action against those responsible for these attacks and to ensure the safety and security of all citizens, regardless of their faith."" The incidents have also sparked protests from Hindu groups, who have accused Christians of forcible conversions and other forms of religious intolerance. The Indian government has long maintained that there is no evidence of widespread forced conversions in the country. Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been accused of stoking religious tensions in the past. The party has a strong Hindu nationalist base, and some of its leaders have been criticized for making inflammatory statements against religious minorities. However, the BJP has denied any involvement in the recent violence, and Mr Modi has urged calm and peace. He has also called for an end to rumour mongering and the spread of fake news. Despite the prime minister's assurances, tensions remain high in several parts of India. The violence has disrupted normal life, with schools and colleges closed and transport services disrupted in some areas. India's religious minorities, who make up about 20% of the population, have long expressed concerns about their place in Indian society. They have accused the BJP of fostering a climate of intolerance towards religious and cultural",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Pakistan is hit by dengue fever epidemic,"By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad They have warned that it threatens to affect other parts of the country. More than 4,000 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Pakistan's Punjab province over the past few weeks, according to health officials. The mosquito-borne disease is spreading rapidly, causing alarm among health authorities and residents alike. Dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever due to the severe joint pain it causes, is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. It can be fatal, particularly in children and the elderly. The symptoms include severe headache, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, and a rash. The Punjab Health Department has urged people to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. ""People should take extra care to protect themselves from mosquito bites,"" Dr Asim Shah, a senior health official in Punjab, told BBC News. ""That means using mosquito nets, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and using insect repellent."" The department has also launched a campaign to spray insecticides in affected areas and to set up more hospitals to treat those infected. But with limited resources and a large population, the challenge is immense. The epidemic comes as Pakistan prepares to celebrate Eid al-Adha, the Muslim festival of sacrifice, which falls on 20 July this year. The crowds that gather for the festivities and the traditional animal sacrifices could provide fertile ground for the spread of the disease. Health officials are particularly concerned about the potential impact on children, who are among the most vulnerable to dengue fever. ""We are seeing a large number of children being admitted to hospitals with the disease,"" Dr Shah said. ""It's important that parents take extra care to protect their children from mosquito bites."" The dengue fever outbreak in Pakistan is not an isolated incident. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a global resurgence of the disease, with more than 3 billion people at risk in 128 countries. The WHO has called for increased efforts to prevent and control the spread of the disease. Pakistan's neighbor, India, has also been hit hard by dengue fever this year. More than 20,000 cases have been reported in various parts of the country, with the worst affected areas being the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The spread of dengue fever in Pakistan and India is a reminder of the challenges facing health systems in developing countries, where limited resources and inadequate infrastructure can make it difficult to contain the spread of infectious diseases. It is a call to action for governments, health organizations, and communities to work together to prevent and control the spread of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Trump campaign website hacked in 'cryptocurrency scam',"His re-election campaign team is investigating the security breach of President Donald Trump's official website, which was hacked over the weekend in what is believed to be a cryptocurrency scam. The team became aware of the issue on Saturday when visitors to the site were redirected to a page asking for Bitcoin donations, despite the site not normally accepting cryptocurrency. The page also carried a threatening message, warning that the site had been ""penetrated by a foreign hacking group."" In a statement, the campaign team said: ""The world has had enough of the fake news spread daily, and unfortunately, now our digital campaign has been victimized by this despicable tactic. We are taking this breach very seriously and are working with law enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts to get to the bottom of this."" The hackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in the website's content management system, allowing them to make the changes to the site's code and redirect visitors to the fraudulent page. It is not yet clear how long the site was compromised for, but the team says that they have taken steps to rectify the issue and secure the site against further attacks. The incident is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of cyber attacks against political campaigns and organizations. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile hacks of political sites and email servers, most notably the hack of the Democratic National Committee's email system during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The Trump campaign team has not yet identified the perpetrators of the attack, but they are working with law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts to determine the origin of the breach. They are also urging anyone who may have donated Bitcoin in response to the fraudulent page to come forward and contact the campaign directly. In the meantime, the campaign has taken the site offline for further testing and security checks. Visitors are being redirected to the campaign's official social media channels for the latest updates and information. The incident is sure to raise concerns about the security of political campaigns' digital infrastructure, and the need for greater protections against cyber attacks. As the use of digital platforms in political campaigns continues to grow, so too does the risk of hacks and other forms of cyber attacks. In a statement, the campaign team reiterated their commitment to protecting the integrity of their digital operations: ""We will continue to take every necessary step to ensure the security of our digital campaign and the confidentiality of our supporter data. Cybersecurity is a top priority for our team, and we will not rest until we have fully addressed this issue.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ant and Dec 'wanted to quit' Britain's Got Talent,"The presenting duo of Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, better known as Ant and Dec, have revealed that they felt the need to quit Britain's Got Talent due to a sense of being ""sidelined"" during the audition process. In an exclusive interview, they opened up about their frustrations with the production team and the way their segments were being used. Ant and Dec have been a staple of Britain's Got Talent since its inception in 2007. They have been responsible for hosting the live shows and presenting the audition episodes. However, in recent years, they have noticed a trend where segments they filmed for the audition shows kept ""ending up on ITV2,"" according to Dec. This meant that their segments were not being shown during the main BGT broadcast, but rather on a secondary channel. ""We've always been proud of the work we do on the audition shows. We put a lot of effort into them, and it's frustrating when that work isn't seen by the largest possible audience,"" Dec explained. Ant added, ""We felt like we were being sidelined, and it didn't feel fair. We've always been committed to BGT, but this was starting to feel like a demotion."" The duo's frustrations went beyond just the airing of their segments. They also felt that they were not being consulted enough about the direction of the show. ""We've been doing this for so long, and we have a lot of experience and ideas. But it felt like we weren't being listened to,"" Ant said. The situation came to a head during the most recent series of Britain's Got Talent. Ant and Dec made the decision to withhold their services for the audition episodes. ""We couldn't continue in good faith if our work wasn't going to be given the respect it deserves,"" Dec stated. Their departure caused a stir, with many fans expressing their disappointment on social media. But the production team quickly moved to address the issue. They announced that Ant and Dec would be back for the live shows, and that they were working on a solution to ensure that their audition segments were given the exposure they deserved. ""We're glad that we were able to come to a resolution with the production team,"" Ant said. ""We love being a part of Britain's Got Talent, and we're looking forward to the rest of the series."" Dec added, ""It's important that we're valued and respected for the work we do. And we believe that's been acknowledged now. We're excited to be back and to continue our journey on BGT.""

Mexico police detain US 'sect leader' after triple murder,"Police raids in Mexico's northern Coahuila state have led to the detention of Orson William Black Jr, a 56-year-old US citizen wanted on child abuse charges in the United States. Authorities also believe him to be a suspect in a recent triple murder. The raids, which took place on Saturday, targeted three houses and two ranches belonging to Black in the towns of Piedras Negras and Allende. Mexican police worked in collaboration with their US counterparts and the FBI to execute the search warrants. According to Mexican prosecutors, the evidence gathered during the raids includes firearms and ammunition, suggesting a possible link to the triple murder that occurred in the region last week. The victims - two women and a man - were found dead in a house in Allende on March 25. The motive behind the killings remains unclear, but investigators are exploring various angles, including the possibility of a drug-related dispute. Black, who has been on the run since 2018, is wanted in the US state of Texas on charges of aggravated assault and injury to a child. He is also suspected of committing various other crimes in the US, including theft and drug offenses. Mexican authorities have not yet announced formal charges against Black in connection with the triple murder. However, they have stated that they will be cooperating with US authorities to extradite him once the legal proceedings are complete. The detention of Black comes as part of a larger effort by Mexican law enforcement to crack down on crime in the northern states, which have long been plagued by violence linked to drug cartels and organized crime. In recent years, the government has increased its presence in the region, deploying thousands of soldiers and federal police to combat crime and secure the border with the US. Despite these efforts, crime rates in the northern states remain high. According to data from Mexico's National Council for Public Security, Coahuila recorded 421 homicides in 2021, up from 368 in 2020. The state also recorded 1,171 kidnappings in 2021, the highest number in Mexico outside of the violence-plagued states of Guerrero and MichoacÃ¡n. Black's arrest is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to bring criminals to justice in the region. However, it also serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by Mexican authorities in combating crime and ensuring public safety. With the cooperation of international partners like the US, and the continued commitment of Mexican law enforcement, progress can be made in the fight against crime in the northern states.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Over to you, chancellor","Simon Jack, Business Editor: Although a cut of quarter of a percent was not a surprise, a specific message that it could fall further towards zero by year end was unexpected. Add to that an additional announcement from the Governor of the Bank of England that the central bank would restart its bond buying programme, and it became clear that we were in for a significant monetary policy shift. Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who had just finished his statement to the Commons, was handed the baton by the Speaker as the focus of attention shifted. There was a sense of anticipation as he prepared to speak. ""This is a challenging time for our economy,"" he began, ""but I want to reassure the British people that we will do whatever it takes to support jobs and businesses through this crisis."" Sunak outlined a package of measures worth Â£30 billion, including a new payroll support scheme, grants for the hardest-hit businesses and extended loans for those still struggling. He emphasised that the government would continue to do ""whatever it takes"" to help businesses survive the winter. But it was the Chancellor's announcement on tax that caught the headlines. Sunak confirmed that he would extend the temporary reduction in stamp duty, which was due to end in March, until the end of June. This move would save homebuyers up to Â£15,000 on the purchase of a property worth up to Â£500,000. Sunak's statement was met with a mixed reaction. Some welcomed the measures as a necessary lifeline for businesses and individuals. Others questioned the wisdom of borrowing more money to fund the initiatives. Meanwhile, the pound fell sharply against the dollar, reflecting the uncertainty caused by the combination of the Bank of England's monetary policy shift and the Chancellor's fiscal stimulus. As the markets closed, investors were left pondering the implications of the day's events. A cut in interest rates and a renewed bond buying programme from the Bank of England, combined with a substantial increase in government borrowing, raised questions about the UK's long-term economic prospects. The Chancellor's statement had provided short-term relief, but the longer-term challenges remained. The UK continues to grapple with the economic fallout from the pandemic, with uncertainty around the timing and pace of the recovery. As we head into the winter months, the focus will be on whether the government's measures will be enough to support businesses and households through the crisis. And with the Bank of England signalling that interest rates could go lower still, the prospect of negative interest rates is no longer just a theoretical one.

Hundreds of children wait years for asylum decisions,"By Patrick Cowling & Sadaf Maruf, BBC News The Home Office figures obtained by the BBC reveal that hundreds of children are still waiting for years to have their asylum applications decided in the UK. These delays, which have nearly tripled since January 2014, are causing significant distress and uncertainty for these young individuals and their families. In January 2014, 484 children had been waiting for more than five years for their asylum decisions. However, the latest data from the Home Office shows that, as of October 2021, there were 1,339 children in this category, a 183% increase in just over seven years. The reasons for these lengthy delays are multifaceted. Complex cases, resource constraints, and the backlog of applications following the pandemic have all contributed to the situation. Additionally, the asylum system's ability to process the applications of unaccompanied children efficiently has been challenged. The consequences of these delays can be severe. Children's safety, education, and emotional wellbeing are all put at risk. The uncertainty surrounding their future can hinder their ability to learn English, integrate into their communities, and secure stable accommodation. The longer they wait, the more difficult it becomes for them to rebuild their lives. The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, expressed her concern over the situation, stating, ""Children who have fled war and persecution, often alone, are entitled to quick, fair and effective asylum decisions. It's deeply concerning that so many are being left in limbo for years."" The Home Office has acknowledged the issue, stating that they aim to reduce the backlog and improve the processing times for asylum applications. However, with the number of applications continuing to rise, it remains a significant challenge. Meanwhile, charities and advocacy groups are calling for urgent action to address the issue. They argue that the government must invest more resources into the asylum system and provide adequate support for unaccompanied children while their applications are being processed. As the situation stands, the wait for hundreds of children continues, with no end in sight. Their future remains uncertain, and their wellbeing is at stake. The delays in the asylum decision-making process not only have an impact on their lives but also on their ability to contribute positively to their new communities. It is crucial that the government and relevant stakeholders take immediate steps to address this pressing issue and ensure that these children receive the support and certainty they so desperately need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hong Kong: What is China's 'patriot' plan for electoral reform?,"Beijing's proposal for electoral reform in Hong Kong, aiming to prevent ""unpatriotic"" figures from holding political power, has raised concerns among critics both in the city and internationally. The Chinese government's plan, announced in March 2021, proposes to overhaul the electoral system for Hong Kong's legislative council and the chief executive, a move critics argue would effectively end the city's semi-autonomous status. Under the proposed reforms, only candidates who are deemed ""patriotic"" and ""loyal"" to China would be allowed to run for office. The exact criteria for what constitutes ""patriotism"" and ""loyalty"" have yet to be defined, but it is expected that candidates would be required to pledge allegiance to the Chinese government and its policies, including the controversial National Security Law. Critics warn that this would effectively disenfranchise a significant portion of Hong Kong's population, particularly those who hold pro-democracy or pro-independence views. They argue that the reforms would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" framework that has governed Hong Kong since its handover from British rule in 1997, and could further erode the city's legal and political autonomy. Moreover, some fear that the reforms could lead to increased political repression and a further crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong. The city has already seen a significant rollback of its freedoms in recent years, with the implementation of the National Security Law in 2020 leading to the arrests of numerous pro-democracy activists and the disbanding of political organizations. Beijing's push for electoral reform comes as Hong Kong faces unprecedented challenges, including a deepening economic downturn, rising unemployment, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many in the city believe that the government should focus on addressing these issues rather than imposing further political restrictions. The international community has also expressed concern over the proposed reforms. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have all issued statements criticizing the moves and expressing their commitment to upholding the city's autonomy and protecting its human rights. Despite the criticism, however, it is clear that Beijing is determined to press ahead with the reforms. The Chinese government has argued that the changes are necessary to ensure stability and order in Hong Kong, and to prevent foreign interference in the city's affairs. The exact timeline and implementation details of the reforms remain unclear, but it is expected that they will be enacted through a legislative process in Hong Kong. The city's pro-democracy camp has vowed to resist the changes, and it remains to be seen how this standoff will play out in the coming months.

"Iran scientist Shahram Amiri free to leave, US insists","The state department rejected claims by Tehran that Shahram Amiri, who surfaced at a Pakistani embassy building in the capital city of Islamabad, had been abducted by US agents. Mr. Amiri, a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist, had vanished more than a year ago, sparking a diplomatic row between Iran and the United States. Iranian officials were quick to allege that Mr. Amiri had been kidnapped by the CIA during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2010. However, the State Department insisted that there was no evidence to support these claims, stating that Mr. Amiri was a free man and had chosen to seek refuge in Pakistan. ""We have no information to suggest that Mr. Amiri was in any way taken against his will,"" said a State Department spokesperson. ""We encourage Iran to focus on the well-being of its citizens and to allow them the freedom to make their own choices."" The Iranian government, however, was not appeased. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi accused the United States of ""piracy and terror"" and demanded an explanation for Mr. Amiri's whereabouts over the past year. Iranian officials also demanded that Mr. Amiri be handed over to Iranian authorities if he was indeed in Pakistan. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes. The United States and its allies, however, suspect that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Mr. Amiri's disappearance and alleged abduction had fueled anti-American sentiment in Iran, with many Iranians seeing it as further evidence of American hostility towards their country. The incident also comes just weeks after a deadly attack on the Saudi Arabian embassy in Tehran, which was allegedly carried out by Iranian protesters in response to the execution of a prominent Shia cleric in Saudi Arabia. Despite the diplomatic row, Pakistani officials have insisted that they would not hand over Mr. Amiri to Iran or the United States without his consent. ""Mr. Amiri is a free man, and he will be allowed to decide for himself where he wants to go,"" said a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesperson. The incident has raised questions about the safety and security of Iranian citizens both at home and abroad. Iranian officials have called for increased security measures to protect Iranian diplomats and citizens abroad, while the United States has urged its citizens to exercise caution when traveling to Iran. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the United States and Iran will respond to this latest diplomatic incident.

Meet the butterflies from 200 million years ago,"By Helen Briggs, BBC News Scientists have discovered fossilised butterfly scales the size of a speck of dust inside ancient rock from Germany, pushing back the date for the origins of the Lepidoptera, one of the world's most diverse and beautiful groups of insects. The scales, which date back approximately 190 million years, were found in the Solnhofen limestone region, renowned for its well-preserved fossils. This discovery challenges the previous belief that the earliest known butterflies appeared around 160 million years ago. The newly identified scales belong to a group of butterflies called the Micropterigidae, which were once thought to be the most primitive butterflies. However, this discovery suggests that even more ancient butterflies have yet to be discovered. Dr. Torsten Wappler, a paleontologist from the University of Bonn, led the study. He explained that the scales were found using a method called micro-CT scanning, which allowed the team to examine the rock in great detail. ""We found the scales embedded in a thin layer of sediment, and we were able to extract them using a fine needle,"" said Dr. Wappler. ""The scales are incredibly small, measuring just a few micrometers across, so it was a challenging but rewarding process."" The researchers believe that these ancient butterflies likely had wingspans of only a few millimeters. They also had a different wing structure compared to modern butterflies, with a more membranous and less cellular appearance. The discovery of these ancient butterflies provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of the Lepidoptera. Dr. Wappler explained that the group's origins have long been a mystery due to the scarcity of well-preserved fossils. ""Butterflies are an essential part of many ecosystems, and they play a crucial role in pollination,"" he said. ""Understanding their evolutionary history can help us appreciate the incredible diversity and adaptability of these fascinating creatures."" The study, published in the journal Current Biology, also raises intriguing questions about how these ancient butterflies lived and interacted with their environment. For example, they may have relied on different types of food sources and had different mating behaviors compared to modern butterflies. Further research is needed to answer these questions and uncover more about the lives of these early Lepidoptera. The discovery of these fossilised butterfly scales is a significant step towards understanding the evolutionary history of one of nature's most captivating insects.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cambridge anorexic woman who died 'wanted to be assessed',"Amanda Bowles, 45, was found deceased at her Cambridge home in September 2017. The inquest into her death, held at Cambridgeshire Coroner's Court on Tuesday, revealed that Ms Bowles had not been monitored by the eating disorder service for approximately four months prior to her passing. Ms Bowles, a mother of two, had a long history of anorexia, with her first admission to hospital being over three decades ago. She had been receiving treatment from the eating disorder service since 2015, but in May 2017, she was discharged, despite her BMI (Body Mass Index) still being below the minimum threshold for recovery. According to evidence presented at the inquest, Ms Bowles had expressed a desire to be reassessed, but her request was not granted. Instead, she was advised to attend a GP surgery for routine follow-up appointments. However, Ms Bowles did not attend these appointments, and no further action was taken by the eating disorder service. The inquest heard testimony from medical professionals, who acknowledged that Ms Bowles' case was complex and that her recovery was a slow process. They also acknowledged that the service was under pressure and that resources were limited. However, the coroner expressed concern that the service had not followed its own guidelines for post-discharge care, which included regular follow-up appointments and contact with patients. The inquest also heard that there were delays in referrals to other services, such as mental health teams, which could have provided additional support. Ms Bowles' family attended the inquest and read out a statement expressing their anger and disappointment at the failings of the service. They called for greater investment in mental health services and urged the eating disorder service to learn from Ms Bowles' tragic death. The inquest ended with a verdict of suicide, but the family and their representatives made it clear that they believed Ms Bowles' death was a preventable tragedy. They called on the eating disorder service to take action to ensure that no other family has to endure the pain and loss they have experienced. The coroner agreed, urging the service to take steps to improve its post-discharge care and to ensure that patients who express a desire for further assessment are given the support they need. She also called on the government to invest more in mental health services and to recognise the importance of providing adequate resources to tackle eating disorders and other mental health conditions. As the inquest came to a close, the room was filled with a sombre silence, as those present reflected on the life of a woman who died wanting to be assessed, but was instead left to struggle alone. The tragic death of Amanda Bowles serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adequate mental health services and the need for greater investment and support for those who are struggling with eating disorders and other mental health conditions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Guildford Four's Gerry Conlon: Funeral takes place in Belfast,"His coffin was carried into St Peter's Cathedral in west Belfast by four members of the Birmingham Six, as friends, family, and supporters gathered to say their final goodbyes to Gerry Conlon. Mr. Conlon died at home in west Belfast on 21 June, after an illness that had plagued him for some time. He was 60-years-old. Gerry Conlon was a central figure in one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in Irish and British history, known as the Guildford Four. In 1974, Conlon and three others â Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong, and Carole Richardson â were wrongly convicted of bombing two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, and a Woolworth's store in Woolwich, London. The bombs had killed five people and injured 67 others. The trial was marred by allegations of police misconduct, including the use of coerced confessions. All four maintained their innocence, but were convicted based on the testimony of a convicted criminal turned police informant named 'Carmel' who later recanted his testimony. Conlon spent 15 years in prison before being released in 1989 when the convictions were quashed. The Guildford Four case became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre in the fight for justice, leading to the establishment of the miscarriage of justice appeals system in the UK. Born in Derry in Northern Ireland, Conlon moved to London with his family when he was a child. He returned to Belfast in the late 1960s to join the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Conlon's political activism led to his arrest in 1973, and to his eventual wrongful conviction. Upon his release in 1989, Conlon became an advocate for the innocence of the Birmingham Six, a group of six Irish men who had also been wrongly convicted of the same pub bombings in Birmingham. The Birmingham Six were released in 1991, and Conlon worked tirelessly to clear their names. During his final years, Conlon continued to campaign for the release of other prisoners he believed to be innocent and to raise awareness of miscarriages of justice. He also wrote a book about his experiences, ""Proved Innocent: Gerry Conlon's Own Story,"" which was published in 1992. As his coffin was carried into St Peter's Cathedral, the hymns sung by the congregation echoed through the ancient stone walls. Friends and family took turns sharing memories of Gerry, recalling his strength, his humor, and his unwavering commitment to justice. Outside the cathedral, a large crowd had gathered to pay their respects. Many held up banners and placards,",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Staffordshire reveals cost of policing mental illness,"Patrick Burns, Political editor, Midlands One of the first things to strike Staffordshire's incoming Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), Matthew Ellis, was the escalating cost to his force of dealing with people in mental health crisis. The issue, he quickly realised, was not unique to Staffordshire but was a significant challenge facing police forces across the country. The financial burden of dealing with mental health-related incidents has become a major concern for law enforcement agencies in England and Wales. According to figures obtained by the BBC, Staffordshire Police spent over Â£10m on mental health-related incidents between 2017 and 2020. This represented a 25% increase from the previous four-year period. The cost of these incidents is not just financial. The mental and emotional toll on police officers dealing with these situations is significant, with many reporting feeling underprepared and ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of mental health crises. Ellis, who took office in May 2021, has made it a priority to address this issue. He has launched a strategic review of how Staffordshire Police respond to mental health-related incidents, looking at ways to improve the response and reduce the financial burden on the force. The review, which is being carried out in partnership with mental health charities and local health authorities, will look at how best to support officers in dealing with these incidents and provide them with the training they need. It will also explore the potential for more collaboration between the police and mental health services, with a view to diverting people away from the criminal justice system and into the care they need. ""We recognise that our officers are often the first point of contact for people in mental health crisis,"" said Ellis. ""It's important that we give them the tools and support they need to deal with these situations effectively, and that we work with health services to ensure that people get the care they need rather than ending up in a police cell."" The review is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with recommendations due to be implemented in early 2022. Ellis hopes that the findings will not only benefit Staffordshire Police but will also inform the work of other forces across the country. The issue of policing mental health is not a new one, but the financial and human cost to the police force has become increasingly unsustainable. With mental health services struggling to keep up with demand, the police are being called upon to deal with more and more incidents. It is clear that a new approach is needed, one that prioritises support and care over criminalisation. Ellis is determined to make a difference in Staffordshire and hopes that his review will help pave the way for a more collaborative and effective approach to policing mental health. ""It's time for us to work together to find a better way of supporting people in mental health crisis,"" he said",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

EU-student funding guarantee extended,"By Katherine Sellgren, BBC News education reporter And these students' loans and grants will be available for the duration of their degree course. The arrangement will be honoured even if the UK exits the EU in a no-deal Brexit scenario. This assurance comes as part of a new deal aimed at ensuring continuity for EU students in the event of a Brexit. The UK government has confirmed that EU students starting their courses in the academic year 2020/21 will continue to have access to student loans and grants, as well as the same tuition fees as home students, for the duration of their studies. This applies to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Minister for Universities, Michelle Donelan, stated, ""We value the contribution that EU students make to our universities and to our country. We want to provide certainty and reassurance for those students who are due to start their studies in the UK in the autumn."" The UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) has confirmed that these students will also continue to be eligible for student accommodation, as well as other student support. A spokesperson for UKCISA said, ""The government's announcement today provides welcome clarification for EU students who are due to start their studies in the UK in the autumn. This will help to ensure that they can plan their studies with confidence."" The announcement follows growing concerns from students and university leaders over the impact of Brexit on EU students. Many had expressed fears that they might not be able to afford to continue their studies in the UK if they lost access to student loans and grants. The president of the National Union of Students (NUS), Larissa Kennedy, welcomed the announcement, stating, ""This is a crucial step in providing EU students and their families with the reassurance they need to plan for their future."" However, Kennedy also called on the government to go further and ensure that EU students will continue to have the same rights to work during and after their studies as they do now. The new deal also applies to students from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland who are part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Swiss Confederation. The UK's departure from the EU is currently scheduled for 31 January 2020, with a transition period ending on 31 December 2020. The government is currently in negotiations with the EU over the terms of the UK's exit. It is hoped that the new deal will provide some clarity for EU students, but it is unclear what the situation will be for students starting their courses after the academic year 2020/21. The government has confirmed that it will provide further updates in due course.

General Election: Loyalists warn unionists not to vote Alliance,"By Mark Devenport, BBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), a representative body for loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, has issued a stark warning to unionist voters not to support the Alliance Party in the upcoming General Election. In a statement, the LCC, which was launched in 2015, said that ""any unionist who votes for Alliance parties is actually voting for Sinn Fein."" The group, which represents the interests of loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), went on to accuse the Alliance Party of being ""the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) fifth column."" The DUP is the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland and has been a longstanding partner of the Conservative Party at Westminster. The party has been critical of the Alliance Party in the past, accusing it of being soft on issues related to Northern Ireland's peace process and the Irish language. The LCC statement continued: ""We're urging every unionist to think carefully about who they are going to vote for in this election. The Alliance Party may wear the cloak of nationalism, but they are ultimately working against the interests of the unionist community."" The warning comes as tensions continue to simmer in Northern Ireland over a range of issues, including the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU, and the ongoing dispute over the flying of the Union Flag at Belfast City Hall. The LCC statement was met with criticism from the Alliance Party, which described it as an attempt to ""undermine democracy and intimidate voters."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: ""It's disappointing to see yet another attempt by the Loyalist Communities Council to interfere in the democratic process. We will not be intimidated by their threats and will continue to represent the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland, regardless of their background or political affiliation."" The warning from the LCC is likely to add to the sense of unease in Northern Ireland, where the peace process remains fragile, and where paramilitary groups continue to wield significant influence over some communities. The General Election in Northern Ireland is due to take place on December 12, with all eyes on the results in the region, which could have significant implications for the political landscape in both Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole. The LCC's warning to unionist voters is a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of politics in Northern Ireland, and the ongoing challenges faced by those seeking to promote peace, stability, and reconciliation in the region. Despite the challenges, however, many in Northern Ireland remain committed to the peace process and to the belief that a better future is possible, one",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Manchester Arena Inquiry: 'Stakes too high' to delay 'Martyn's Law',"Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett was tragically taken in the Manchester Arena attack, has been relentless in her pursuit of justice and preventing similar tragedies from occurring in the future. With a deep sense of determination, she has called for the implementation of ""Martyn's Law,"" a proposed piece of legislation that would enhance security measures in crowded public spaces and venues. The government has publicly expressed its support for these plans, but progress has been slow, leaving Murray and others affected by the attack growing increasingly impatient. At a recent hearing of the Manchester Arena Inquiry, Murray addressed the panel with impassioned pleas to expedite the process. ""We cannot afford to delay this any longer,"" she implored. ""The stakes are too high, and the potential consequences of inaction are unthinkable."" She went on to explain that the legislation, which would include measures such as mandatory bag checks and increased police presence at events, would provide much-needed peace of mind for families and friends of those attending concerts and other public gatherings. Murray's calls for action have been echoed by other victims' families, as well as security experts and members of the public. Lord Bob Kerslake, the chairman of the inquiry, has acknowledged the need for increased security but has also emphasized the importance of striking a balance between safety and individual freedoms. ""We must ensure that any measures implemented are proportionate and do not unnecessarily infringe upon people's civil liberties,"" he stated. Despite these concerns, many believe that the time for action is now. Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese has expressed his support for Martyn's Law, stating that the city cannot afford to be complacent in the face of potential threats. ""We have to accept that the risk of terror attacks is a reality we have to live with,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean we have to accept them as an inevitable part of our lives."" The inquiry is expected to release its final report in the coming weeks, which will outline recommendations for improving security at the arena and other public spaces in Manchester. It remains to be seen how quickly these recommendations will be implemented, but Murray and others are hopeful that progress will be made soon. ""We owe it to Martyn and to all those who have been affected by this terrible attack to do everything in our power to prevent such tragedies from happening again,"" she said. As the inquiry continues its work, the debate over Martyn's Law and the balance between security and individual freedoms rages on. One thing is certain, however: The victims of the Manchester Arena attack and their families will not rest until every possible measure is taken to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The college principal issued a statement expressing his shock and disappointment at the incident. ""Runshaw College is a place of learning and creativity, where our students are encouraged to reach their full potential,"" he said. ""It is deeply upsetting that a small number of individuals chose to disrupt the peaceful learning environment, and we will be working closely with the police to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice."" The college was placed in lockdown following the incident, with students being advised to stay inside until the situation had been resolved. Parents were notified of the incident, and many rushed to the campus to collect their children. The police have appealed for anyone with information about the disorder to come forward.

""We understand that this incident will have caused significant distress for students and staff at the college, and we are working to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions."" The college has offered support to those affected by the incident, with counseling services being made available to students and staff. The college has also issued a statement urging students to report any incidents of bullying or violence to the authorities. The incident has left the local community in shock, with many expressing their concern for the safety of their loved ones. ""I can't believe this has happened at Runshaw College,"" said one parent. ""I send my child there every day, and I trust that they will be safe. It's just terrible that something like this has happened."" The college has a history of excellence, with a strong focus on academic achievement and student wellbeing. It is unclear what motivated the individuals involved in the disorder, but the college has vowed to take action to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. The police investigation is ongoing, and further updates are expected to be released in due course.

Covid-19: Northamptonshire moves to tier 3,"The county of Northamptonshire, located in the east midlands of England, will be moving to the higher level of Covid-19 restrictions, tier three, from 00:01 GMT on 26 December, the government has announced. This comes as cases of the virus continue to rise in the area and across the country. The announcement was made on Thursday, 24 December, by Health Secretary Matt Hancock during a press briefing. He confirmed that the county will join other areas, including London, South Yorkshire, and the Midlands, under tier three restrictions. Under tier three restrictions, people are advised not to enter or leave the area unless it is essential. This includes avoiding overnight stays in accommodation, except where necessary, such as for work or education. However, people in tier three areas can form support bubbles with one other household. This means that two households can form an exclusive bubble and can see each other without the need to socially distance. The new restrictions also mean that pubs and bars must close unless they can operate as restaurants, serving substantial meals. Hospitality venues can only sell alcohol with a main meal, and must close at 11 pm. Non-essential retail, entertainment venues, and leisure facilities must also close, although outdoor sports and exercise classes can continue. Hancock acknowledged that the announcement would bring disappointment and hardship to many people in the county, particularly during the festive period. He urged everyone to follow the rules to help control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. The move to tier three restrictions follows a period of rapid increase in cases in Northamptonshire. On Wednesday, the county recorded 531 new cases, taking the total to 8,166. The seven-day rate per 100,000 people was 371.2, above the threshold of 350 required for the highest tier of restrictions. Local leaders, including Northamptonshire's director of public health, Lucy Wightman, have expressed concern about the rise in cases and urged people to take the virus seriously. Wightman said that the new restrictions were necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and to save lives. Meanwhile, some businesses in the county have expressed frustration and disbelief at the announcement, particularly as many had already made preparations for a busy festive period. The British Hospitality Association called on the government to provide more financial support for businesses affected by the restrictions. Despite the challenges, local health leaders and officials have urged people to stay positive and to work together to control the spread of the virus. They have urged everyone to continue following public health guidelines, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and washing hands regularly. They have also encouraged people to get tested if they develop any symptoms, and to self-isolate if they test positive or are contacted by contact tracers.

Gamer Hbomberguy hands funding row charity Donkey Kong boost,"YouTuber Hbomberguy, known for his insightful and entertaining videos on various topics, made headlines recently after raising an astonishing Â£265,000 for charity by playing Nintendo 64's classic game, Donkey Kong, live online. The fundraising marathon came about following a proposed lottery grant for Mermaids, a charity supporting children and young adults with mermaid-related disabilities, being put under review. Father Ted sitcom writer Graham Linehan had initially shared the news of Mermaids' potential loss of funding on Twitter, which subsequently led Hbomberguy to announce his plans to raise money through streaming his marathon Donkey Kong session. The livestream event saw Hbomberguy playing for 32 hours straight, breaking the previous world record for the longest time spent playing Donkey Kong in a single session. As the hours passed, donations poured in, with supporters motivated by the cause and the engaging commentary provided by Hbomberguy and his team. The event managed to attract the attention of media outlets and influential figures, including actor and presenter Stephen Fry, who made a generous donation and encouraged his followers to do the same. With the help of his audience, Hbomberguy was able to surpass the original fundraising goal of Â£175,000 and ultimately raised over double the amount. Mermaids, understandably, were thrilled with the outcome and expressed their gratitude towards the YouTuber and his supporters, emphasizing the significant impact the funds would have on the charity's ability to continue its work. The record-breaking event not only highlighted the power of community and the generosity of individuals but also showcased the potential of streaming platforms as a means of raising awareness and funds for charities. Hbomberguy's marathon session demonstrated that even the most seemingly mundane activities, like playing a classic video game, could result in something extraordinary when done for a good cause. As the event came to an end, Hbomberguy expressed his relief and gratitude, acknowledging the effort and support of his team, his viewers, and the various individuals who contributed to the cause. He also emphasized the importance of continued support for Mermaids and encouraged his followers to remain engaged with the charity's work. The success of Hbomberguy's Donkey Kong marathon not only provided a substantial financial boost for Mermaids but also served as a reminder of the potential for positive change through the power of community and the use of digital platforms. In a world often overshadowed by negativity and division, the event offered a refreshing reminder of the good that can be achieved when people come together for a common cause.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Olympic Games Â£500k steam cloud artwork in Wirral delayed,"The Â£500,000 publicly funded spinning column of cloud, scheduled to rise over the Wirral estuary from 31 December as part of the Cultural Olympiad, has yet to materialize due to planning delays. The ambitious art installation, designed by artist Jaume Plensa, was set to become a symbolic landmark for the Liverpool City Region during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The project, named ""Awilda and the Water Tower,"" was initially announced in 2018, with a planned completion date in 2021. It was intended to be a permanent addition to the Wirral waterfront, creating a striking visual presence and adding to the region's cultural offering. However, concerns have been raised regarding the planning application for the artwork. The Wirral Council has stated that the application is incomplete, citing missing information regarding the structure's foundations and the impact on the local environment. These issues must be addressed before the application can be approved and construction can begin. Art supporters and those involved in the project have expressed disappointment and frustration at the delay. Local residents had been eagerly anticipating the arrival of the artwork, which was expected to attract visitors and boost the local economy. In addition, the project was seen as a symbol of the region's commitment to culture and the arts. Plensa's team has stated that they are working closely with the council to address the planning concerns and hope to have the application approved as soon as possible. In the meantime, preparations for the Olympic and Paralympic Games continue, with the region gearing up for a summer of sport and celebration. Despite the delay, the team remains optimistic that ""Awilda and the Water Tower"" will still be completed in time for the Games. Plensa has previously stated that the artwork is a symbol of hope and resilience, and its delayed arrival only serves to underscore its significance. The Wirral Council has assured the public that they will keep them updated on the progress of the planning application and the artwork's construction.

Not guilty plea in landmark Kodi box trial,"By Jane Wakefield, Technology reporter Mr Thompson, a 37-year-old man from Wakefield, England, entered a not guilty plea at the Old Bailey court on Monday in a landmark trial related to the sale of Kodi boxes. The case will be closely watched by others in the tech community as it could set a precedent for the legality of modifying and selling the media players. Mr Thompson is accused of selling ""fully loaded"" Kodi boxes, modified with software that allowed users to watch pirated content. The software, known as Kodi add-ons, grants access to copyrighted material, including movies, TV shows, and live sports, without the necessary licenses or permissions. Prosecutors allege that Mr Thompson sold more than 300 boxes through various online marketplaces, earning over Â£150,000 in the process. The defense argues that Mr Thompson was only selling the hardware and that users were responsible for installing and using the pirated add-ons themselves. Jurors were shown evidence of Mr Thompson's online sales, as well as conversations with potential buyers discussing the availability of pirated content. The defense argued that this evidence did not prove that Mr Thompson was aware of the piracy taking place on the devices after they were sold. The Kodi media player itself is legal and open-source, meaning anyone can modify and distribute it. However, the use of pirated add-ons to access copyrighted content is a violation of intellectual property laws. The question at the heart of this trial is whether Mr Thompson can be held responsible for the actions of users after the sale. The trial comes at a time when the sale and use of pirated content is increasingly under scrutiny. In the UK, the Intellectual Property Office estimates that copyright infringement costs the economy Â£1.3 billion annually. The film and TV industries have been particularly vocal in their opposition to piracy, with the Motion Picture Association (MPA) claiming that it costs the industry $29.2 billion in lost revenue each year. The case is being closely watched by tech enthusiasts and those in the Kodi community, who see it as an attack on their right to modify and use open-source software as they see fit. Some have taken to social media to express their support for Mr Thompson, while others have criticized him for profiting from piracy. The trial is expected to last several days, with witnesses from both the prosecution and defense set to testify. A verdict is expected later this week. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that this case will have significant implications for the tech community and the ongoing debate around intellectual property and open-source software.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Surrey Police investigation over 'misgendering' tweets,"Caroline Farrow, a well-known commentator and campaigner, expressed her surprise and disappointment upon learning that Surrey Police intend to interview her under caution regarding tweets she posted in October. The tweets in question were made following her appearance on ITV's Good Morning Britain alongside Susie Green, the chief executive of Mermaids, a charity that supports children with gender identity issues and their families. Farrow's tweets, which have since been deleted, were in response to a segment on the show during which Green called for a ban on conversion therapy, a controversial practice aimed at changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. Farrow criticized Green's views on transgender issues and expressed her belief that it is not possible to change a person's biological sex. Following the show, Farrow received a significant amount of backlash on social media, with many accusing her of being transphobic and misgendering individuals. In response, she tweeted, ""I don't believe in your self-diagnosed 'gender identity' and I'll continue to call you a man if that's what you were born. Get over it."" Despite deleting the tweets, Surrey Police have notified Farrow that they wish to conduct a taped interview under caution. This means that she will be interviewed under the same legal conditions as a criminal suspect. The decision has raised concerns among some, who argue that Farrow's tweets do not rise to the level of a criminal offense. Farrow has since spoken out about the investigation, stating that she believes her comments were protected under freedom of speech. ""I haven't done anything wrong. I've expressed a view that is not popular with the transgender lobby, but it's a view that is held by many people,"" she said. The investigation comes at a time when there is growing debate around the rights of transgender individuals and the limits of free speech. Some argue that it is essential to protect individuals from hate speech, while others believe that the right to express unpopular opinions must be upheld. Surrey Police have not yet commented on the specifics of the investigation or why they have chosen to interview Farrow under caution. It is unclear whether this is a warning shot intended to deter others from expressing similar views or whether there is more to the case than meets the eye. In the meantime, Farrow remains defiant, vowing to continue speaking out on issues she believes in, even if it means facing further scrutiny and potential legal action. ""I'll keep speaking out because it's important to have a debate about these issues,"" she said. ""I won't be silenced."" The investigation into Farrow's tweets is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what the outcome will be.

Wife of 39 years fails in divorce refusal appeal,"Tini Owens, a 66-year-old woman from Coventry, England, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn a family court ruling that prevented her from divorcing her husband, Hugh Owens, 78. But the appeal judges, led by Lord Justice McFarlane, Lord Justice Baker, and Lady Justice Arden, dismissed her appeal on Thursday, October 3, 2019. In 2018, the family court in London ruled that Mrs. Owens had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that her marriage had irretrievably broken down. The court found that her grounds for divorce, which included her husband's supposed unreasonable behavior, did not meet the legal requirements. Mrs. Owens, who had been married to her husband for 39 years, argued that the ruling was unfair and that the law was outdated. Her legal team argued that the current law, which requires one spouse to prove fault to obtain a divorce, should be changed to allow no-fault divorces. However, the appeal judges disagreed, stating that Mrs. Owens had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that her marriage had irretrievably broken down. They also emphasized that the law did not prevent her from divorcing but only required her to provide evidence to support her grounds for divorce. The judgment has sparked a heated debate about the need for no-fault divorces in England and Wales. Many have expressed their support for Mrs. Owens and her legal team's call for reform. The Marriage Foundation, a think tank that promotes healthy relationships, has urged the government to consider introducing no-fault divorces to make it easier for couples to separate. According to the foundation, the current law can make an already difficult situation even harder by forcing one spouse to blame the other for the breakdown of the marriage. The Church of England, which has a significant influence on family law in England and Wales, has also weighed in on the debate. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said that the law needs to be reformed to make it easier for couples to divorce, but he has also warned against making the process too easy. Mrs. Owens' legal team has indicated that they may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, but it is unclear whether they will do so. In the meantime, the debate about the need for no-fault divorces in England and Wales is likely to continue. The case of Tini Owens highlights the complex and often contentious nature of divorce law in England and Wales. It also underscores the need for a more modern and compassionate approach to family law that recognizes the realities of modern relationships and the importance of allowing couples to move on from failed marriages in a dignified and respectful way.

North Korea: Mike Pompeo rejects 'gangster-like' accusation,"After two intense days of negotiations with North Korean officials in New York, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emerged from the United Nations General Assembly with a firm message for the international community: denuclearization of North Korea is not only a US priority, but a shared goal with the international community. Speaking to reporters outside the UN headquarters, Pompeo reiterated that denuclearization was a condition for any kind of normalization of relations or easing of sanctions against Pyongyang. He also rejected accusations from North Korea that the US approach to denuclearization was ""gangster-like."" ""I find those characterizations unfortunate and inappropriate,"" Pompeo said. ""We are engaged in serious diplomacy here. We are working to rid the Korean Peninsula of the threat of nuclear weapons, and I think that's a goal that's worthy of the international community's support."" Pompeo went on to explain that during his talks with North Korean officials, he had emphasized the importance of complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. He also acknowledged that there were still significant challenges to be addressed, including the issue of North Korea's ballistic missile program and the verification process. However, Pompeo expressed optimism that progress was being made, pointing to the fact that North Korea had returned to the negotiating table after a long hiatus. He also stressed that the US was committed to working in close coordination with its allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan. ""We will continue to work with our partners to achieve the objective that we all share â the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Pompeo said. ""We are hopeful that we can make progress and that we can build on the foundation that was laid in Singapore between President Trump and Chairman Kim."" Pompeo's remarks came after a series of diplomatic back-and-forth between the US and North Korea in recent weeks. Following a high-level summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, there had been some optimism that progress was being made towards denuclearization. However, tensions rose again in late August when North Korea conducted its third missile test in less than a month, prompting the US to cancel a planned high-level meeting between Pompeo and North Korean officials. Despite these setbacks, Pompeo expressed confidence that the diplomatic process was on the right track. ""We remain committed to our objective,"" he said. ""We will continue to work in close coordination with our partners, and we believe that we can achieve a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula."" Pompeo's remarks were welcomed by South Korea, which has been a key player in the diplomatic process.

UN net meeting 'hit by hackers' causing website disruption,"The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was in full swing, with delegates from around the world gathered in Dubai to debate changes to a wide-ranging communications treaty. However, their progress was suddenly halted when the United Nations' Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, which hosts the conference website and related documents, was hit by hackers. The disruption caused chaos among the delegates, who were unable to access crucial information related to the meeting. Many were left frustrated and unable to prepare for important discussions, as they were unable to review relevant documents and data. The hack, which came at a critical point in the conference, threatened to derail the entire proceedings. The UN ICT team worked tirelessly to contain the breach and restore access to the website and related materials. However, the hackers proved tenacious, and it took several hours before the situation was brought under control. In the meantime, the conference was forced to adopt alternative methods of communication, with delegates relying on email and other channels to share information and collaborate. The cause of the hack remained unclear, with speculation focusing on potential motives ranging from political agendas to financial gain. The UN ICT team was tight-lipped about the details of the attack, but assured delegates that they were taking all necessary measures to prevent a recurrence. The incident served as a stark reminder of the growing threat posed by cybercrime, particularly in the context of international meetings and conferences. It also highlighted the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, as well as the need for contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the face of such disruptions. Despite the disruption, the WCIT conference pressed on, with delegates resilient in their determination to reach a successful outcome. The incident, while inconvenient, provided an opportunity for the global community to reaffirm its commitment to collaboration and innovation in the face of evolving challenges. As the conference drew to a close, the UN ICT team reported that they had made significant progress in strengthening their cybersecurity defenses. Delegates expressed their gratitude for their efforts and their commitment to working together to ensure a safer and more secure future for international communications.

Head and neck cancer drug 'game changer',"By Michelle Roberts, Health editor, BBC News online Trial results coming out of a US cancer conference suggest that a new drug could be a game changer for head and neck cancer patients, offering better outcomes than standard chemotherapy. The drug, called pembrolizumab, is a type of immunotherapy that works by helping the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. It has already shown promise in treating some types of advanced cancer, including lung and skin cancer. But the latest studies presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago suggest it could also be effective in treating head and neck cancers, which are often difficult to treat and can be debilitating. One study, led by Dr. Ross Levine from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, found that pembrolizumab was more effective than standard chemotherapy in treating advanced head and neck cancers that test positive for a protein called PD-L1. The study involved more than 800 patients and found that those treated with pembrolizumab lived longer without their cancer progressing than those given chemotherapy. The drug was also better tolerated by patients, with fewer side effects. Another study, led by Dr. Thomas Powles from Barts Cancer Institute in London, found that pembrolizumab could be used as a first-line treatment for some head and neck cancers. The study involved more than 1,500 patients and found that those given pembrolizumab lived longer than those given standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy. ""These results are very exciting and suggest that pembrolizumab could be a game changer for the treatment of head and neck cancers,"" said Dr. Powles. ""It's a significant step forward and we hope to see it become a standard treatment option in the future."" The findings have been welcomed by cancer charities and patient groups, who have long called for new and more effective treatments for head and neck cancers. ""These are very promising results and offer hope to people with advanced head and neck cancers,"" said Sarah Schultz, from the charity Head and Neck Cancer Foundation. ""We need more treatments like this to give people the best chance of survival and a good quality of life."" The studies are still ongoing and further research is needed to confirm the findings, but experts say they could lead to a major shift in the way head and neck cancers are treated. ""These are very significant findings and could change the way we approach the treatment of head and neck cancers,"" said Prof. Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute in London. ""Immunotherapy is a new and exciting area of cancer research and these results demonstrate its potential to transform the lives of patients with advanced cancers."" The results come as the NHS prepares to roll out a new cancer drug funding",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Brexit: Further clashes over work on NI port controls,"By Mark Devenport, BBC News NI Political Editor The controls are currently used for checks on agri-food products and animals at Northern Ireland's ports. In July, the UK government confirmed it intended to put border control posts at these ports as part of the new Brexit arrangements. Work to expand the existing facilities has been ongoing, but it's not been plain sailing. The planned infrastructure has sparked controversy and further clashes between the UK and the European Union. Last week, the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, warned the UK that the new checks could threaten the Good Friday Agreement. Brussels has also threatened legal action if the UK proceeds with the plan. The UK's Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis, has insisted that the new infrastructure is necessary to maintain the integrity of the UK's single market. He's also stressed that the checks are not a customs border, but rather a ""sanitary and phytosanitary"" one. However, the EU and Irish government argue that the checks will create a de facto border in the Irish Sea, which could undermine the peace process and potentially threaten the unity of the UK. The DUP, Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, has welcomed the UK's plans. They argue that the checks are necessary to protect Northern Ireland's economy from the EU's import tariffs. However, they have also criticised the UK government for not doing enough to communicate the rationale behind the checks to the public. Meanwhile, the Irish government has called on the EU to engage in talks with the UK to find a solution. Dublin has proposed a ""standstill"" agreement, which would delay the introduction of new checks until a wider trade deal is reached. The UK and EU have until the end of the year to negotiate a new trade deal. However, with the new port controls already under construction, tensions are running high. The next few months could see further clashes between the two sides, potentially threatening the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has already caused significant disruptions to trade and supply chains. The UK government has insisted that it will do everything in its power to minimise any potential disruption to the flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Despite the challenges, both sides have pledged to find a mutually acceptable solution. The coming weeks and months are likely to be a test of their commitment to that goal. The future of Northern Ireland's ports and the wider peace process could well hang in the balance.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Zika virus: 'Strongest evidence yet' of effect on babies,"Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), was testifying before politicians in Washington, DC. He held the room's attention as he spoke with grave concern about the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. The CDC had been monitoring the virus closely since its emergence in Brazil late last year. Dr. Frieden began by sharing the strongest evidence yet of the virus's devastating effect on unborn babies. ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" Dr. Frieden began, ""I want to share with you some alarming data from two infants in Brazil who died shortly after birth. Both mothers had been infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy. Autopsies revealed severe brain damage in both infants, a condition known as microcephaly, which is characterized by abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains."" The room grew quiet as Dr. Frieden continued, ""This is not an isolated incident. We have now documented over 1,600 cases of microcephaly in Brazil, and we believe that the number could be much higher. The evidence is clear: Zika virus can cause birth defects in human babies."" Dr. Frieden went on to explain that the virus was transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, but that it could also be spread sexually. He urged pregnant women to take extra precautions to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and to use condoms if their partners had traveled to areas where Zika was present. The politicians listened intently, many of them visibly concerned. Dr. Frieden urged them to take action to prevent the spread of the virus in the United States. He called for increased funding for mosquito control programs, more research into the virus, and public education campaigns to raise awareness about the risks. As the hearing came to a close, Dr. Frieden left the politicians with a sobering warning. ""We are dealing with a serious public health threat,"" he said. ""If we don't act now, we could see a significant increase in the number of babies born with microcephaly not only in Brazil but also in other countries, including the United States."" The room emptied slowly as the politicians went back to their offices to discuss what they had heard. The evidence presented by Dr. Frieden was undeniable: Zika virus was a threat to unborn babies, and urgent action was needed to protect future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Mariam Moustafa death: Family not told about court case,"Mariam Moustafa, an 18-year-old Nottingham University student, tragically fell into a coma following an unprovoked attack in February last year. Her family was devastated as they watched their beloved daughter cling to life in intensive care. After months of hope and prayer, Mariam passed away due to complications from a stroke. Her father, Mohamed, has now revealed that the family were not informed about a court case regarding the assault on their daughter. Mohamed expressed his deep disappointment and frustration, stating, ""We were not informed about the court proceedings against the person who attacked Mariam. We were not even told the outcome of the case. It feels like we have been kept in the dark throughout this entire process."" The authorities involved have stated that they followed the correct protocols in informing the next of kin of Mariam's death. However, they failed to communicate effectively about the court proceedings, leaving the family feeling excluded from the justice process. Mohamed continued, ""We should have been kept informed about every step of the way. As Mariam's parents, we had every right to know what was happening. The least they could have done was to keep us updated. It's not just about the court case, but about respect and compassion for the family of the victim."" The lack of communication from the authorities has left the Moustafa family feeling disconnected from the justice system. They have called for greater transparency and empathy in these situations, to ensure that the families of victims are kept informed and involved in the legal process. Mohamed added, ""We want to make sure this doesn't happen to another family. Mariam's death was a terrible blow to us, and we don't want anyone else to go through the pain and confusion that we have experienced."" The Nottinghamshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have apologised for the misunderstanding and have promised to review their communication processes with victims' families in the future. Mariam's death was a senseless tragedy, and the Moustafa family's call for greater transparency and compassion is a reminder of the importance of supporting victims and their families throughout the legal process. The loss of Mariam has left a deep void in the lives of her family and friends. They will continue to remember her as a bright, beautiful, and loving young woman who had her entire life ahead of her. Mariam's tragic death serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting the vulnerable and ensuring that justice is served with compassion and transparency.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
HS2 underground protest: Activists 'being forced out' of tunnel,"HS2 Rebellion, a group of activists determined to prevent the construction of the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway line, have taken drastic measures to thwart their eviction from the site. Camped out at Euston Square Gardens in London, the activists have dug tunnels beneath the planned construction area in an attempt to disrupt the project. The team, which has been protesting against the HS2 railway line for months, claims that the railway's construction team is burrowing a vertical tunnel that is causing crumbs of earth to fall around them. The activists fear that this tunnel could destabilize their own underground hideout, forcing them out of their makeshift shelter. ""We're not going to let them force us out of here without a fight,"" said one of the activists, who wished to remain anonymous. ""We've put our bodies on the line to stop this destructive project, and we're not going to back down now."" The HS2 Rebellion has been a thorn in the side of the construction team since the beginning of the project. The group has used various tactics to disrupt the construction process, including blocking roads and chaining themselves to equipment. However, their latest move to dig tunnels beneath the construction site is by far their most audacious action yet. The activists have been living in the tunnels for weeks, relying on donations from supporters to survive. They have set up a makeshift kitchen, a sleeping area, and even a library in the cramped space. However, the arrival of the vertical tunnel has made their situation increasingly precarious. ""We're not just fighting for ourselves,"" said another activist. ""We're fighting for future generations. The HS2 railway line is going to cause untold damage to the environment and to local communities. We can't let that happen."" The HS2 Rebellion's actions have drawn widespread attention, with many praising their determination to stand up against the railway project. Others, however, have criticized their tactics, arguing that they are only delaying the inevitable and causing unnecessary disruption. The construction team, for its part, has condemned the activists' actions as dangerous and illegal. ""The safety of our workers and the public is our top priority,"" a spokesperson for the HS2 project said. ""We will take all necessary measures to ensure that the construction process proceeds safely and efficiently."" Despite the risks, the HS2 Rebellion shows no signs of giving up. They continue to dig and protest, determined to put a stop to the railway line that they believe will cause irreparable damage to their community and the environment.

Bishop Peter Ball victim withdraws from church abuse review,"Peter Ball, 84, was jailed in October for offences against 18 teenagers and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. One of his victims, who had bravely come forward to give evidence during Ball's trial, has now decided to withdraw from the independent church review into the handling of his case. The victim, who has chosen to remain anonymous, had given a statement to the review, which is being led by Prof Jayne plateau-Zimmerman, a professor of social work at the University of Central Lancashire. The statement detailed the abuse he suffered at the hands of Ball, as well as the impact it had on his life. However, the victim, now in his 50s, has decided to withdraw from the review, citing the distress caused by the experience of giving evidence and the retraumatisation he has experienced since Ball's trial. In a statement, his legal representative said: ""My client has taken the difficult decision to withdraw from the review process. The giving of evidence at the trial was a harrowing experience for him and, since the trial, he has suffered significant distress as a result of the media attention. He feels that continuing with the review process would cause him further harm."" The withdrawal of the victim comes as a blow to the church and to those who have been campaigning for justice for Ball's victims. The Bishop of Truro, the Rt Revd Philip Mounstephen, who is the lead bishop on safeguarding for the Church of England, said: ""I am deeply sorry to hear that one of Bishop Ball's victims has decided to withdraw from the review. My thoughts are with him and I understand his decision. We remain committed to the review process and to ensuring that all those who have been harmed by Bishop Ball are given the support they need."" The review, which was announced by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in November, is intended to examine how the church responded to allegations of abuse against Ball, who was Bishop of Gloucester from 1992 to 1995 and Bishop of Lewes from 2002 to 2012. The review will also look at how the church can learn from the experience and improve its safeguarding procedures. Ball was initially investigated in the 1990s, but no action was taken against him at the time. It was only in 2015 that allegations against him were re-examined and he was charged with offences. He was found guilty in October 2015 of misconduct in public office and indecent assault and was jailed for 32 months. The Church of England has come under criticism for its handling of the Ball case and for its response to allegations of abuse in general. The review is seen as an opportunity for the church to address",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Glan Clwyd Hospital: Disciplinary action promised by Jones,"Carwyn Jones was speaking as it emerged the health minister's statement on the Tawel Fan scandal had been withdrawn. Instead, he addressed the media with a solemn expression, outlining the steps his government would take to restore public confidence in Glan Clwyd Hospital following the alarming revelations. The First Minister acknowledged the gravity of the situation and expressed his deep concern for the patients and their families who had been affected by the substandard care at the hospital. Jones pledged that his administration would leave no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of the matter and holding those responsible accountable. ""We take these issues extremely seriously,"" he said. ""Our priority is the safety and wellbeing of our patients. I want to assure the public that we will leave no stone unturned in our investigation into the Tawel Fan ward. We will take any necessary steps to ensure that the right disciplinary actions are taken against those responsible for the substandard care."" Jones went on to confirm that an independent inquiry would be launched into the scandal, which involved allegations of poor hygiene, inadequate staffing, and inappropriate patient care. The inquiry, he said, would be led by an experienced and impartial external expert and would have the power to compel witnesses and gather evidence. The First Minister also announced that the hospital's interim chief executive, who had been in place since May, would be stepping down from his role with immediate effect. He would be replaced by an experienced NHS manager from outside the region, who would be brought in to provide fresh leadership and expertise. Jones further announced that the hospital would be subjected to a comprehensive review by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which would assess its overall performance and identify any areas for improvement. The CQC, he said, would have the power to take enforcement action if necessary. The First Minister also took the opportunity to pay tribute to the hard-working staff at Glan Clwyd Hospital, the majority of whom, he said, were dedicated and compassionate professionals who deserved the full support of the government in their efforts to provide the best possible care for their patients. ""The vast majority of staff at Glan Clwyd Hospital are committed and diligent individuals who care deeply about their patients,"" he said. ""We must not lose sight of this fact. We will work closely with the hospital and its staff to support them in their efforts to improve the quality of care and regain the trust of the public."" As Jones concluded his statement, he reiterated his government's commitment to transparency and accountability, and urged anyone with information about the Tawel Fan scandal or any other concerns about healthcare in Wales to come forward.

Alstom: GE and French state agree to work on new offer,"France's economy minister Arnaud Montebourg delivered a bold statement on Tuesday, announcing that neither General Electric (GE) nor the joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer met the French government's demands in the ongoing Alstom bid. However, he also revealed that the government had chosen to work on a new proposal with GE instead of pursuing the joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries offer. The Alstom bid, a multibillion-dollar deal, has been a contentious issue between the French and American governments for several months. GE had offered to buy a majority stake in Alstom's power business, which the French government saw as a potential threat to its national industrial interests. The issue escalated when the French government announced its intention to block the deal, leading to a diplomatic spat between the two countries. In response, the European Commission launched an investigation into the deal, with some European Union (EU) countries expressing concerns over potential job losses and the impact on competition in the European market. The investigation is expected to last several months, and the outcome remains uncertain. Montebourg's announcement came after several rounds of negotiations between the French and American governments. He emphasized that the French government's priority was to protect national interests and safeguard jobs, especially in the sensitive power sector. ""We have made it clear that we will not sacrifice the future of Alstom and the French industry for the benefit of foreign companies,"" Montebourg said. ""We have listened to the concerns of our European partners, and we are committed to finding a solution that respects the rules of the EU and the interests of all parties involved."" The decision to work on a new proposal with GE marks a significant turn of events in the Alstom saga. The French government has not disclosed any details about the new offer, but it is expected to address the concerns raised by the EU and protect French industrial interests. GE, for its part, has expressed its willingness to engage in constructive talks with the French government. ""We are committed to finding a solution that is in the best interest of all parties involved,"" a GE spokesperson said. ""We believe that a strong Alstom is good for the power industry and for Europe as a whole."" The Alstom bid remains a complex issue with far-reaching implications for French industrial policy, EU competition rules, and Franco-American relations. The outcome of the negotiations will be closely watched by investors, industry experts, and policymakers around the world.

"Covid: New lockdown needed, say Yorkshire leaders","Schools in England have shut to most pupils and people have been asked to stay at home under tighter coronavirus restrictions, with leaders in Yorkshire urging the government to consider a new lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield and the Labour Party's candidate for the upcoming mayoral election in South Yorkshire, said that the region was at a ""critical point"" and that more needed to be done to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. ""We are seeing record numbers of cases in South Yorkshire, and the situation is getting worse by the day,"" Jarvis said. ""The current measures are not enough to stop the spread of the virus. We need the government to consider a new lockdown for the region."" Jarvis' calls for a new lockdown were echoed by other leaders in Yorkshire, including Tracy Brabin, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, who said that the government's ""hands-off approach"" was not working. ""The situation in Yorkshire is desperate, and the government's hands-off approach is not working,"" Brabin said. ""We need bold action to get on top of this virus, and that means a new lockdown for the region."" The new restrictions, which came into force on Monday, mean that schools will be closed to most pupils, except for those of key workers and vulnerable children. Non-essential retail, hospitality, and leisure businesses have also been forced to close. The move comes as the number of Covid-19 cases in the UK continues to rise, with over 50,000 new cases reported on Saturday alone. The government has defended its decision to impose the new restrictions, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid saying that the measures were necessary to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. ""The situation is serious, and we cannot let the NHS be overwhelmed,"" Javid said. ""That's why we have taken the decision to impose new restrictions in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly."" However, the calls for a new lockdown have been met with criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that the economic impact of another lockdown would be devastating. ""We cannot keep going in and out of lockdowns,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality. ""The economic impact of another lockdown would be catastrophic for the hospitality sector, which is already reeling from the effects of the previous ones.""

Bloodhound takes first drive across the desert,"By Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Pilot Andy Green took the jet-powered vehicle Bloodhound on a gentle 100mph (160km/h) shakedown test run on Friday, marking a significant milestone in the project's long-awaited return to the desert. Bloodhound is a supersonic car designed to reach speeds of over 800mph (1,287km/h), making it the fastest land vehicle in history. The project, which has been in development for over a decade, was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and funding issues. The shakedown test run took place at the Hakskeen Pan desert in South Africa, a flat, dry lakebed that provides the ideal conditions for high-speed testing. The team had previously carried out preparatory work at the site, including laying down a 1.6-mile (2.5km) long, 3-inch (7.6cm) thick layer of compacted gravel to create a runway. Green, who holds the current land speed record of 763.035mph (1,227.986km/h) set in the ThrustSSC in 1997, described the run as ""a gentle introduction"" for Bloodhound. The team had carried out extensive simulations and analysis to ensure that the vehicle was ready for its first run in over a year. ""It felt good, it felt solid,"" Green said. ""Everything worked as we expected it to, so we're all delighted."" The Bloodhound team plans to carry out a series of increasingly faster runs over the coming weeks, with the ultimate goal of achieving the world land speed record. The team will monitor the vehicle's performance closely, looking out for any potential issues that may arise as the speeds are increased. The project has faced numerous challenges over the years, including funding difficulties, logistical issues, and the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the team remains committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in land speed record attempts. ""This is a great moment for Bloodhound,"" said project director Richard Noble. ""We've had our ups and downs, but we're here now and we're going to make it happen."" The success of the shakedown test run has generated renewed excitement among the Bloodhound team and their supporters. The team's ultimate goal of breaking the 800mph barrier may still be some way off, but the first run in the desert is a significant step towards achieving that dream.

"Farm profits may halve after Brexit, says report","The report, by the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), paints a stark picture for the future of British farming post-Brexit. The worst-case scenario, as outlined in the analysis, would see average farm profits plummeting from a current estimate of Â£38,000 a year to a meagre Â£15,000. The AHDB, an industry-funded organisation, has attempted to model the potential impacts of various Brexit outcomes on farming businesses across the UK. The report's authors warn that the agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to the economic uncertainties that Brexit brings. They base their projections on several assumptions, including the possible end of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies, increased trade barriers, and changes to labour availability and prices. In a no-deal Brexit scenario, where the UK leaves the EU without a trade agreement, the report estimates that farm profits could fall by as much as 62%. This would be due to a combination of factors, including higher tariffs on exports to the EU, increased competition from cheaper imports, and potential losses of CAP subsidies. The AHDB analysis also considers the impact of a free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU. While an FTA would be better for the farming sector than a no-deal Brexit, the report suggests that profits could still be halved. In this scenario, UK farmers would face tariffs on some exports to the EU, potentially leading to reduced sales and lower profits. The report also highlights the potential impact of changes to labour availability and prices. With the UK no longer an EU member state, free movement of labour could end. The agricultural sector relies heavily on seasonal labour from EU countries, and a shortage could lead to increased wages and labour costs. The AHDB's findings have been met with concern from farming organisations and politicians. The National Farmers Union (NFU) has called for more clarity from the government on post-Brexit agricultural policies. NFU President Minette Batters said, ""Farmers need certainty, they need to plan for the future, and they need the government to give them the tools they need to face these challenges."" The government has responded by promising to support the farming sector through the transition to a post-Brexit agricultural policy. Environment Secretary George Eustice has said, ""We are committed to ensuring our farmers and food producers continue to thrive after we leave the EU. That's why we are investing in new policies and programmes to support them, and working to secure the best possible trade deals around the world."" However, with the Brexit negotiations ongoing and the final outcome uncertain, many farmers remain anxious about the future. The AHDB report serves as a stark reminder of the potential financial challenges that lie ahead.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Will Margaret Ferrier remain an MP after breaking rules?,"By Nick Eardley, BBC Political Correspondent Ms Ferrier has been suspended by her party and she has faced criticism across the political spectrum, with the Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross calling for her expulsion. And her position as a Member of Parliament (MP) remains uncertain after she broke coronavirus rules by travelling between England and Scotland during the lockdown period. The Scottish National Party (SNP) MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West admitted she travelled to Glasgow for a meeting on 22 October, despite being aware of new restrictions that came into effect that day, limiting travel to essential journeys only. Ms Ferrier said she had tested negative for Covid-19 before travelling but has since apologised for her actions. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said Ms Ferrier had breached the party's code of conduct, which led to her suspension. The SNP leader at Westminster has the power to lift or extend the suspension. The incident has drawn comparisons to that of former Conservative MP, Owen Paterson, who faced calls for his resignation after an investigation found he had lobbied for firms where he held financial interests. Mr Paterson was later cleared following a vote in the House of Commons on Thursday, but the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he regretted the outcome. Ms Ferrier's case, however, is different in several ways. For one, there are no allegations of financial gain - Ms Ferrier has acknowledged her error in judgement and apologised. But her actions could still have repercussions. Ms Ferrier's case comes at a sensitive time for the SNP. The party is gearing up for a Scottish Parliament election in May, which could see the SNP form a majority government for the first time since devolution. However, the party has already faced criticism over its handling of the pandemic, with some questioning whether it has been stringent enough in its lockdown measures. Ms Ferrier's case could also be seen as a distraction from the SNP's electoral campaign, particularly given the attention it has received in the media. There are also questions about how the SNP leadership will handle the situation internally. For Ms Ferrier, her future as an MP hangs in the balance. She has apologised for her actions and said she would cooperate with any investigation. But the suspension from her party, and the calls for her expulsion, suggest her position may be untenable. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has said he will consider the matter carefully and make a decision in due course. But the longer the suspension lasts, the more uncertain Ms Ferrier's future as an MP becomes. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced politicians to make difficult decisions, and the rules around travel have been particularly challenging. Ms Ferrier's case serves as a reminder of the importance of following",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UKIP make their mark in Scotland,"Brian Taylor, Political editor, Scotland. So, quite deliberately, I grabbed the chance today to offer my congratulations to each of Scotland's elected MEPs among the throng gathered in Edinburgh City Chambers for the final declaration. And commiseration to those who missed out on a European Parliament seat. The Scottish National Party (SNP) took the lion's share with eight MEPs, followed closely by the Scottish Conservatives with five. But the real story of the night was the unexpected surge of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in Scotland. UKIP, known mostly for its anti-EU stance, has traditionally struggled to gain traction north of the border. But tonight, they defied expectations and secured two seats, both in the South West Scotland region. These victories mark a significant milestone for the party in Scotland, as they have historically failed to make any real impact in the country's politics. The victories of UKIP's David Coburn and Louise Bours are a clear indication of the dissatisfaction among some Scottish voters with the EU and the political establishment. In an interview with the BBC, Coburn said, ""The people of Scotland have spoken. They've sent a clear message, not just to the EU but to the Westminster politicians that they want change, and they want it now."" The SNP, which has long been critical of the EU, has faced criticism for its inconsistency on the issue. While it advocates for Scottish independence, it is a staunch supporter of EU membership. This contradiction might have played a role in the UKIP success, as some voters may have seen the party as the only genuine alternative to the status quo. UKIP's performance in Scotland is a stark reminder of the changing political landscape in the country. The traditional two-party system seems to be crumbling, with smaller parties like the SNP and UKIP gaining ground. The Scottish Conservatives, once a formidable force, now find themselves in a precarious position, having lost three seats to the SNP and one to UKIP. As the dust settles on the European election results, it is clear that the political landscape in Scotland has been irrevocably changed. The SNP still holds the largest number of seats, but UKIP's unexpected surge is a warning sign for the political establishment. The European elections have shown that the people of Scotland are not afraid to shake things up and demand change. And for parties like UKIP, that presents a golden opportunity to make their mark. It is important to note that while UKIP's success is significant, it does not necessarily translate to a wider shift in Scottish public opinion. The European elections often see lower voter turnout and are used as a platform for protest votes. It remains to be seen if the party can sustain this momentum in the upcoming Scottish Parliament and Westminster elections. But one thing is for sure: the political landscape",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Zero waste society plans for Scotland unveiled,"Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead addressed a crowd of enthusiastic onlookers at the Scottish Parliament, calling for a revolutionary approach to tackle the nearly 20 million tonnes of waste produced by Scotland each year. He unveiled Scotland's ambitious plans for a zero waste society, a goal that intends to drastically reduce the amount of waste generated and promote more sustainable practices across the country. The zero waste plan includes tough new regulations and incentives designed to encourage businesses and individuals to reduce their waste production. Key among these measures are extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes that will require manufacturers to take back and recycle their products at the end of their life. This initiative, which has been successful in other European countries, will ensure that producers have a financial incentive to design products with recyclability and reuse in mind. Furthermore, the Scottish Government plans to introduce a deposit return scheme (DRS) for single-use beverage containers. This system, which has proven effective in countries like Germany and Norway, aims to incentivize consumers to return bottles and cans for recycling by offering a small deposit that is returned when the container is returned. This not only reduces the amount of waste generated but also ensures that valuable recyclable materials are not lost. Scottish households will also see changes as the government introduces a new food waste prevention strategy. This strategy includes plans for mandatory food waste collections and the provision of food waste caddies to help households reduce the amount of food they throw away. Additionally, the government will work with supermarkets and food retailers to reduce food waste at the source by implementing better supply chain management practices and improving labelling to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions. The Scottish Government is also investing in the development of a circular economy infrastructure, which includes plans for new recycling and reprocessing facilities. This will create new jobs and help Scotland become a leader in the circular economy. Furthermore, the government will provide support and funding for community projects and initiatives that aim to reduce waste and promote sustainable practices. Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead concluded his speech by stating, ""Scotland has the potential to lead the way in the global transition to a circular, zero waste economy. This plan is not just about reducing waste â it's about creating new opportunities, new jobs, and a better future for our communities and our planet."" The zero waste plan, which is set to be implemented over the next five years, is a significant step towards Scotland's goal of becoming a circular economy leader and reducing its carbon footprint. By working together, businesses, individuals, and the government can create a sustainable future for Scotland.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Views sought on new ideas to further regenerate Cardiff,"The proposals to further regenerate Cardiff have been outlined in a consultation, with the city divided into five distinct areas for various types of development. Replacing the Motorpoint Arena with a state-of-the-art cultural and convention centre is one such idea being put forward for the Central Area. This new development would not only attract more tourists but also provide a significant boost to the local economy. Moving on to the Northern Area, plans include creating an innovation park along the eastern docklands. This park would act as a hub for tech start-ups and small businesses, encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation. It would also provide opportunities for research collaborations between academia and industry, further strengthening Cardiff's position as a knowledge economy. The Southern Area focuses on improving public spaces and enhancing the urban environment. Proposals include transforming the Roath Park Lake into a major urban green space, with new walkways, cycle paths, and picnic areas. Additionally, there are plans to revitalize the Bute Street area, turning it into a vibrant cultural quarter filled with art installations, independent shops, and street food vendors. Moving towards the Western Area, there is a strong focus on sustainable transport and connectivity. Plans include extending the Metro system to Penarth and Barry, making it easier for residents in these areas to access Cardiff's amenities. Furthermore, there are proposals to develop a network of cycling and walking routes, making Cardiff a more bike-friendly city and reducing the reliance on cars. Lastly, the Eastern Area plans focus on residential development and community engagement. Proposals include constructing new affordable housing units in the Adamsdown area and redeveloping the St. Mary Street area to create more community spaces. Additionally, there are plans to improve public services, such as healthcare and education, in this area to ensure that residents have access to the resources they need to thrive. These are just some of the ideas being considered in the consultation to regenerate Cardiff. The city council is seeking views from the public on these proposals, as well as any other suggestions people may have. The consultation period ends on the 31st of January, and all feedback received will be carefully considered before any decisions are made. Regenerating Cardiff is not just about physical development but also about creating a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable community. These proposals aim to achieve that by providing new opportunities for businesses, improving public spaces, enhancing connectivity, and investing in affordable housing and community services. The future of Cardiff looks bright, and it's an exciting time to be involved in its ongoing transformation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Kashmir uproar over Afzal Guru clemency plea,"By Mehboob Khan, BBC News A resolution had been tabled on the case of Afzal Guru, who was convicted over the 2001 India parliament attack, in the Indian parliament on Tuesday. Sheikh Rashid, the independent parliamentarian from Jammu and Kashmir, led the charge, calling for clemency for the man sentenced to death for his role in the deadly attack. The debate over Guru's fate has sparked renewed anger and protests in the disputed region of Kashmir, where many view Guru as a hero and a symbol of resistance against Indian rule. Guru, a resident of the Kashmir Valley, was sentenced to death in 2002 after being convicted by the Indian Supreme Court of his involvement in the attack that left 31 people dead. His case has been a source of controversy for years, with many arguing that the evidence against him was flawed and that he was given a hasty trial. Sheikh Rashid, who has long advocated for the release of political prisoners in Kashmir, said in the parliament that there was ""compelling evidence"" that Guru was innocent. He called on the Indian government to reconsider his case and grant him clemency. The call for clemency has been met with widespread protests in the Kashmir Valley, where many view Guru as a martyr and a symbol of resistance against Indian rule. Protesters took to the streets on Tuesday, clashing with security forces and hurling stones. Several protesters were reportedly injured in the clashes. The Indian government has rejected calls for Guru's release, with Home Minister Amit Shah reiterating that Guru was ""a terrorist who was involved in the attack on the parliament."" The situation in Kashmir has been tense for years, with frequent protests and clashes between security forces and separatist militants. The region has been disputed between India and Pakistan since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. The case of Afzal Guru has only added fuel to the fire, with many in Kashmir seeing it as yet another example of Indian heavy-handedness and disregard for the rights of the people in the region. The Indian government has maintained that it is committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region, but many in Kashmir remain skeptical and demand greater autonomy and self-rule. As the debate over Afzal Guru's clemency continues, both sides are digging in their heels, and the situation in Kashmir remains volatile. The international community has expressed concern over the situation and called for dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the long-standing dispute.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Robin Gibb: Bee Gees singer's funeral held in Thame,"Hundreds of fans lined the streets of Thame earlier today, paying their respects as a solemn procession made its way through the town. Gibb's body, draped in a white sheet, was carried on a horse-drawn hearse, accompanied by the haunting melody of a lone bagpiper playing ""Amazing Grace."" The small town of Thame in Oxfordshire became the unlikely setting for the funeral of Robin Gibb, one of the most successful pop musicians in history, a member of the legendary Bee Gees. The Gibb family chose Thame, where they had lived for many years, as the place to say their final goodbyes to Robin, who passed away on May 20th at the age of 62 after a long battle with cancer. As the procession made its way through the town, fans gathered in silence, their faces etched with sadness and respect. Many had traveled from far and wide to be a part of this poignant moment, some with tears in their eyes, others with smiles, remembering the joy and inspiration that Robin and the Bee Gees had brought to their lives. The streets were adorned with flowers and memorabilia, a testament to the enduring legacy of the Bee Gees. Fans left messages of condolences and tributes to Robin, expressing their gratitude for the music that had touched their hearts and souls. The funeral service took place at St. Mary's Church, where friends and family gathered to remember Robin's life and share their memories of the man behind the music. Among those in attendance were Barry and Maurice Gibb, Robin's brothers and bandmates, and their respective families. The service was a celebration of Robin's life, filled with laughter and tears, stories and songs. The Bee Gees' hits, including ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""How Deep is Your Love,"" and ""Night Fever,"" provided the soundtrack to the service, a fitting tribute to the man who had co-written and sung them. As the service came to a close and the procession made its way out of the church, the sun broke through the clouds, casting a warm glow over the town. It was a fitting end to a day filled with emotion and reflection, a reminder of the power of music to bring people together and heal even the deepest wounds. Robin Gibb may have left this world, but his music and the memories he created will live on, touching the hearts and souls of generations to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
More than one in 10 providing unpaid care,"Figures from 2011 reveal a significant trend in unpaid caregiving, with the largest increase observed in individuals devoting 50 or more hours per week to this role. Wales, in particular, stood out with a higher percentage of its population engaged in unpaid care compared to any English region. According to the report published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were approximately 6.5 million unpaid carers in the UK at that time, making up around 11% of the adult population. Among these carers, around 1.3 million were providing care for over 50 hours a week. This represents a substantial increase from the previous survey conducted in 2001, which recorded 960,000 unpaid carers working more than 50 hours a week. The reasons behind this surge in unpaid care hours can be attributed to various factors. One of the most significant factors is the aging population, as more people require care and support to manage their daily lives. Additionally, cuts to public services such as social care have left families and friends to pick up the slack. These findings highlight the crucial role played by unpaid carers in the UK, particularly in Wales, where the percentage is higher than in English regions. Unpaid care can encompass a wide range of tasks, from cooking meals and administering medication to providing emotional support and managing personal care. The commitment and dedication shown by unpaid carers are often overlooked, and the physical, emotional, and financial tolls can be significant. In Wales, the situation is even more pressing, with the higher percentage of unpaid carers suggesting a greater need for support and resources. Despite the challenges, many unpaid carers continue to provide care out of love and a sense of duty towards their loved ones. However, it is essential that they receive the recognition, resources, and support they deserve. This includes access to respite care, financial assistance, and emotional support to help them navigate the complexities of their caring role. The UK government has acknowledged the importance of unpaid carers and has introduced various measures to support them. For example, Carer's Allowance provides financial assistance for those caring for someone for at least 35 hours a week. Additionally, local authorities are required to provide carers with assessments to identify their needs and provide appropriate support. As the population continues to age and the demand for unpaid care grows, it is essential that we as a society recognize and value the contributions of unpaid carers. This includes advocating for better resources, services, and support to help them in their caring role. By doing so, we can ensure that unpaid carers receive the recognition and assistance they deserve and enable them to continue providing vital care to their loved ones.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lover jailed for Swanwick car boot murder,"Paula Poolton, a 40-year-old woman from Titchfield, Fareham, was found near Swanwick rail station, Hampshire, on 28 October 2008, eleven days after she went missing. The discovery of her body brought an end to a harrowing search and ignited a series of events that would ultimately lead to the conviction of her killer. At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, the Old Bailey, Justice Auld presided over the trial of Paula's lover, Mark Cain, 46, of Southampton. The courtroom was filled with the solemn air of justice and the weight of expectation. Paula's family and friends sat quietly in the public gallery, their eyes fixed on the defendant as he sat impassively in the dock. The prosecution presented its case, detailing the timeline of Paula's disappearance and the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. Cain's alibi, that he had been at work on the night of Paula's disappearance, was called into question by several witnesses who placed him in the Swanwick area at the time. The defence argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove Cain's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But the jury, after deliberating for several hours, returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the charge of Paula's murder. As the courtroom erupted in gasps and cries, Paula's family and friends broke down in tears. They had finally received the closure they had been seeking for over a year. The courtroom departed, leaving Cain to face the consequences of his actions. The sentencing hearing was set for a later date, and in the meantime, Paula's family and friends began the long process of healing. They set up a charity in Paula's memory, dedicated to raising awareness of domestic violence and supporting victims and their families. Justice Auld passed sentence on Cain, who was given a life sentence with a minimum term of thirty years. The judge described the crime as a ""callous and premeditated"" act of violence, and Cain was taken away to begin his prison term. The trial and sentencing marked the end of a long and painful chapter for Paula's loved ones. But they took solace in the fact that justice had been served, and that Paula's memory would live on through the work of the charity she had inspired. As the courtroom emptied, the silence of the building seemed to echo the solemnity of the occasion. The case of Paula Poolton would go down in history as a tragic reminder of the devastating effects of domestic violence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians?,"By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics Editor Talks aimed at resolving the political deadlock at Stormont are continuing, with welfare reform, finance, and paramilitary activity high on the agenda. However, despite the urgency of finding a solution, there are several thorny issues that are proving to be major stumbling blocks for Northern Ireland politicians. One of the most contentious issues is the question of how to reform welfare in Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of the UK government's welfare reforms. The DUP has long opposed the UK government's plans to introduce welfare reforms in Northern Ireland, arguing that they will cause hardship for the most vulnerable in society. Sinn Fein, on the other hand, has called for the implementation of these reforms, but with protections for the most vulnerable. Another key issue is the question of finance. The Northern Ireland Executive has been without a budget for over a year, and there is little sign of an agreement on how to move forward. The UK government has provided some funding to keep public services running, but this is not a sustainable solution. The DUP and Sinn Fein are at odds over how to raise revenue, with the DUP advocating for a budget based on the rates system, and Sinn Fein calling for a more progressive taxation system. Paramilitary activity is also a major concern, with both the DUP and Sinn Fein expressing frustration over the lack of progress in dealing with this issue. The DUP has called for tougher action against paramilitary groups, while Sinn Fein has argued that the focus should be on engaging with these groups in a peaceful and political manner. However, there is little agreement on how to move forward, and the issue is likely to remain a major sticking point in the talks. Another issue that is causing tension is the question of the Irish language. The DUP has long opposed the introduction of Irish language legislation in Northern Ireland, while Sinn Fein and nationalist parties have called for such measures. The UK government has indicated that it is willing to consider some form of Irish language legislation, but the details of what this might look like are still uncertain. Despite these challenges, there is a sense that progress is being made in the talks. The parties have been engaging in intensive negotiations, and there have been some signs of movement on some issues. However, it is clear that there is still a long way to go before a deal can be reached. The parties will need to find a way to bridge the significant divides that exist on issues such as welfare reform, finance, and paramilitary activity if they are to reach a lasting solution to the political deadlock. In the meantime, the people of Northern Ireland are paying the price for the political impasse. Public services are struggling, and there is a growing sense of frustration and disillusionment with the political process. It is crucial that the parties find a way to reach a compromise",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Balfour Beatty boss quits after profit warning,"The UK's largest building firm, Balfour Beatty, announced on Tuesday that its chief executive, Leo Quinn, would be stepping down following a profit warning. The company expects a shortfall in its UK construction unit, meaning 2014 group pre-tax profits would be lower than previously anticipated. Quinn, who had been in the role since late 2015, was brought in to turn around the struggling business, which had been hit by a series of costly setbacks on large infrastructure projects. Despite some initial progress, the company's construction division continued to underperform, leading to the profit warning. The news sent shares in Balfour Beatty tumbling by more than 15% in early trading, wiping billions off the company's market value. The profit warning came just weeks after the firm revealed that it was considering selling off its US operations in order to focus on its more profitable European business. Quinn's departure is a further blow to the company, which has seen a number of high-profile executives leave in recent years. In 2013, the firm's former finance director, Ian Tyler, left to become chief executive of BP. And in 2014, the company's then-chief operating officer, Graham Howe, resigned just months after joining. Quinn's departure comes at a difficult time for the construction industry as a whole. The sector has been hit hard by the economic downturn, with many large projects being put on hold or cancelled altogether. In addition, the industry is facing increasing competition from offshore firms, which are able to offer lower labor costs and more flexible working practices. Despite these challenges, Quinn had been making progress in turning around the company's fortunes. Under his leadership, Balfour Beatty had won a number of high-profile contracts, including the Â£1.4 billion A14 road improvement project in Cambridgeshire and the Â£300 million redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station in London. However, the company's construction division continued to struggle, with a number of high-profile projects, including the Â£1.5 billion Thames Tideway tunnel project, experiencing delays and cost overruns. Quinn's departure comes just a few weeks before the firm is due to publish its full-year results for 2014. It is expected that the company will announce a significant shortfall in profits, with some analysts predicting that pre-tax profits could be as much as Â£200 million lower than previously anticipated. Despite the challenges facing the company, Balfour Beatty remains a major player in the construction industry, with a strong presence in Europe and a diverse range of capabilities. It is expected that the company will begin the search for a new CEO in the coming weeks, with a view to having someone in place before the publication of its full-year results.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sea lice and disease behind Marine Harvest bid to save Â£44m,"By Douglas Fraser, Business/economy editor, Scotland In Scotland, Marine Harvest, the world's largest salmon farming company, reported a significant loss in its final quarter of 2020, as the impact of sea lice infestations and disease continued to take a heavy toll on its operations. The company plunged to a 4.5m euro (Â£4m) loss in the final three months of last year. This compared with earnings of 75m euros (Â£67m) at the same time in 2019. The setback comes as Marine Harvest, which has its headquarters in Bergen, Norway, but is listed on the Oslo and London stock exchanges, seeks to save Â£44m through a restructuring plan in Scotland. The company is proposing to cut around 250 jobs, or almost a third of its workforce in Scotland, in a bid to reduce costs and improve its financial performance. The Scottish Salmon Company, which is majority-owned by Marine Harvest, has been grappling with a range of challenges in recent years, including high levels of sea lice infestations and disease outbreaks. These issues have led to increased production costs and reduced sales, as customers have become wary of buying salmon that may contain parasites or be affected by disease. Sea lice are tiny crustaceans that live in the sea and can attach themselves to the skin of salmon. In large numbers, they can cause significant harm to the fish, leading to skin lesions, reduced growth rates, and even death. The lice can also transmit diseases, such as pancreas disease and infectious salmon anaemia, which can further weaken the fish and make them more susceptible to other health issues. Marine Harvest has been working to address the issue of sea lice infestations through a range of measures, including the use of cleaner fish, such as wrasse and lumpfish, to eat the lice off the salmon. The company has also been investing in new technologies, such as underwater cameras and sensors, to monitor sea lice levels and take action before they become too high. However, these measures have not been enough to completely eliminate the problem, and the company has faced criticism from environmental groups and some local communities for its handling of the issue. Some have called for stronger regulations to limit the numbers of salmon farms in certain areas, and for more transparency and accountability from the industry. Despite these challenges, Marine Harvest remains optimistic about the future of its operations in Scotland. The company has said that it remains committed to sustainable and responsible salmon farming, and that it believes the industry has a bright future. However, with continuing pressure on costs and the need to address the challenges of sea lice and disease, the road ahead is likely to be a challenging one.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Myanmar coup: India asked to return police officers who crossed border,"Indian officials confirmed on Tuesday that a group of police officers and their families had crossed the border from Myanmar into India in recent days. The revelation came after Myanmar authorities sent a letter to Indian counterparts requesting the return of the officers. The Indian External Affairs Ministry issued a statement saying, ""We have taken note of the communications received from the Myanmar side regarding the matter. We are in touch with the concerned state authorities to address the situation appropriately."" The development comes amidst growing tensions between India and Myanmar following the military coup in the Southeast Asian country in February. India, along with other countries, has condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. The border between India and Myanmar is porous, and there have been reports of people crossing the border in both directions in the wake of the coup. However, the presence of a group of police officers and their families has raised concerns of potential security implications. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military took power, with protests against the coup continuing despite the use of force by the military. The situation has led to an exodus of people, with an estimated 300,000 having fled the country, according to the United Nations. India, which shares a 1,643-mile-long border with Myanmar, has maintained that it will not tolerate any cross-border infiltration or activities that could threaten its security. India has also deployed additional security personnel along the border to prevent any potential security breaches. Meanwhile, Myanmar authorities have denied that there is any large-scale movement of people or security personnel across the border. They have accused India of spreading misinformation and creating unnecessary tensions between the two countries. India's request to Myanmar to take back its police officers comes at a time when the two countries are expected to hold their annual border meeting later this month. The meeting is an important forum for discussing various border-related issues, including security, trade, and infrastructure development. The ongoing crisis in Myanmar has posed a significant challenge to India's foreign policy in the region. India has tried to balance its ties with Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries while also expressing its concerns about the situation in Myanmar and supporting the democratic forces in the country. India has also provided humanitarian assistance to Myanmar, including food, medicine, and other essential supplies, to help those affected by the crisis. India's assistance has been welcomed by the international community, and it has helped to boost India's image as a responsible global player. However, the situation in Myanmar remains complex and volatile, and there are no easy solutions to the challenges facing the country.

Chagos legal status sent to international court by UN,"The UN General Assembly, in a significant move, voted by 94 countries to 15, with 6 abstentions, to request the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands. This decision came after decades of controversy over the island's sovereignty and the forcible removal of its indigenous population in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The resolution, passed on March 23, 2023, urged the ICJ to ""provide an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965."" The Chagos Islands, located in the Indian Ocean, were a British colony at the time, but Mauritius, which had previously administered the territory, claimed sovereignty over the islands when it gained independence from the UK in 1968. Britain, however, retained control of the Chagos Islands, expelling its Chagosian population, many of whom were of African and Indian descent, to make way for a US military base on Diego Garcia, the largest island in the archipelago. The forced removal of the Chagosians, estimated to number around 1,500, has been a source of international condemnation, with human rights organizations and governments accusing the UK of ethnic cleansing and breaching international law. The UN General Assembly resolution was welcomed by Chagosian activists and their supporters, who have long campaigned for the return of their homeland and for compensation for the harm caused to their community. The resolution also marked a significant shift in the diplomatic landscape, with several countries, including France, China, Iran, and Russia, backing the call for the ICJ to examine the issue. The UK, however, has maintained its position that it has lawful control over the Chagos Islands and that its actions were in accordance with international law. It has dismissed the ICJ as an irrelevant body and has threatened unspecified consequences if the court rules against it. The US, which has a long-term lease on Diego Garcia for military use, has also expressed its support for the UK's stance. The ICJ is expected to issue its advisory opinion on the matter within the next year. The ruling could have significant implications for the Chagos Islands, potentially paving the way for their eventual return to Mauritius or leading to a renewed call for compensation for the Chagosian community. Whatever the outcome, the case is likely to remain a contentious issue in international relations and a source of frustration for those seeking justice for the Chagosians. In the meantime, Chagosian activists continue to press for their rights and for the international community to recognize their plight.

"Ysgol Coed Menai school, Bangor, closure plan is backed","Ysgol Coed Menai near Bangor, formerly known as Ysgol Treborth, has been providing education for pupils with social, emotional, and behavioural problems for several years. The school, nestled in the heart of North Wales, has been a vital resource for the local community, offering a supportive and inclusive learning environment for children who require additional help. However, recent developments have cast a shadow over the future of Ysgol Coed Menai. Gwynedd council, which oversees the running of the school, announced plans to close the institution and integrate its pupils into local schools instead. The decision comes after a comprehensive review of special educational needs provision in the region. The council said it had developed plans to support the pupils at local schools, ensuring they receive the same level of care and attention they have come to expect at Ysgol Coed Menai. In a statement, a council spokesperson said: ""We understand that this news may be concerning for families and staff at Ysgol Coed Menai. We want to reassure everyone that we have carefully considered the needs of these children and are confident that they can be effectively supported in their local schools."" Despite the council's assurances, many parents and teachers have expressed their concerns about the potential impact on their children. Ysgol Coed Menai has a unique and experienced staff team, specially trained to cater to the specific needs of pupils with social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties. The fear is that these children may struggle to adjust to a mainstream school environment and may not receive the same level of individual attention. One parent, whose child has attended Ysgol Coed Menai for several years, shared her concerns: ""My child has made incredible progress at this school. The teachers and staff there truly understand his needs and have helped him develop in ways I never thought possible. I'm worried that if he is moved to a mainstream school, he will fall behind and struggle to cope."" The closure plan for Ysgol Coed Menai has also raised questions about the future of similar schools across Wales. Some educators and campaigners have called for a re-evaluation of the government's approach to special educational needs provision, arguing that schools like Ysgol Coed Menai play a crucial role in supporting children with complex needs. The council has promised to consult with parents and stakeholders throughout the process, and a final decision on the future of Ysgol Coed Menai is expected in the coming months. In the meantime, the school's staff and pupils continue to focus on their education and the valuable work they do to help children overcome their challenges. As the debate continues, the future of Ysgol Coed Menai and its pupils remains uncertain.

Covid: Moray moving to level two 'hugely welcome',"The Moray region in Scotland, which had been kept in the highest level of coronavirus restrictions due to concerns about its infection rate, is now moving to level two. This news has been met with a huge sense of relief and excitement by local residents and businesses. The area had been in level three since late October, with restrictions including a ban on indoor socializing and a limit on the number of people who could attend weddings and funerals. The decision to move to level two was made following a drop in the infection rate, which has now fallen below 40 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. Local leaders have welcomed the move, which they say will allow for greater social interaction and economic activity. Moray Council Leader, Councillor Graham Leadbitter, said: ""I'm pleased that the hard work and sacrifices made by everyone in Moray have paid off. This is a significant step forward and we are all looking forward to being able to see more of each other and support local businesses."" Local businesses have also expressed their delight at the news, which they say will help to boost trade during the traditionally quiet winter months. Moray Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive, Lorna Jack, said: ""We are delighted that Moray is moving to level two. This will make a huge difference to our businesses, particularly those in the hospitality and retail sectors. We urge everyone to continue following the guidelines to keep numbers low and support local businesses wherever possible."" The Scottish Government has stressed the importance of continuing to follow guidance to prevent the spread of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The fact that we are able to move Moray to level two is a testament to the efforts of everyone in the area. However, it is essential that we continue to follow the guidelines to ensure we don't see a rise in cases. I would urge everyone to remain cautious and to continue to work together to keep each other safe."" Despite the positive news, there are still concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the region. Moray has been hit hard by the economic downturn, with many businesses struggling to survive. The area also has a higher than average number of people in vulnerable groups, making it a priority for continued support. However, with the move to level two, there is a renewed sense of hope and optimism. Residents and businesses are looking forward to being able to interact more freely and to support each other through the challenges ahead. As one local resident put it: ""It's been a tough few months, but this is a step in the right direction. Let's all work together to make the most of it and keep each other safe.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Microsoft seeks to clean up Xbox game chat with AI,"It is introducing customisable filters that let gamers choose the vocabulary they see in messages from friends and rival players on Xbox game chat. The four levels of filtering range from child-friendly through to entirely unfiltered, providing players with a degree of control over their chat experience. Initially, the filters cover just a fraction of the potentially offensive language that can be used in online gaming. Microsoft's move to clean up Xbox game chat comes as concerns about online abuse and toxicity in gaming communities continue to grow. The technology giant is using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse messages in real-time and automatically block those that breach the company's community standards. The AI system is designed to learn from user feedback, improving its accuracy over time. It can identify and block a wide range of offensive language, including racial and sexual slurs, threats, and hate speech. Gamers will also be able to report any inappropriate messages themselves, allowing Microsoft to take action against repeat offenders. Microsoft is not the first gaming company to introduce filters and AI to tackle online abuse. Other platforms, such as Discord and Twitch, have also introduced similar features in recent years. However, Microsoft's approach is unique in its customisability, giving gamers the power to choose the level of filtering that suits them best. The new features are part of Microsoft's ongoing efforts to create a safer and more inclusive gaming community. The company has also introduced new tools to help players manage their online presence and block unwanted messages. These include the ability to mute individual users or block them entirely, as well as the option to report inappropriate behaviour to Microsoft's support team. The introduction of customisable filters and AI to Xbox game chat represents a significant step forward in the fight against online abuse in gaming communities. By giving gamers more control over their chat experience and empowering them to report inappropriate behaviour, Microsoft is sending a clear message that it takes online safety seriously. However, some have raised concerns about the potential for false positives â messages that are incorrectly flagged as offensive â and the impact this could have on legitimate conversations. Microsoft has acknowledged these concerns and has promised to continue refining its AI system to minimise false positives. Despite these concerns, the introduction of customisable filters and AI to Xbox game chat is a welcome development for many gamers. It is a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming online gaming community, where everyone can enjoy their games without fear of abuse or harassment. In conclusion, Microsoft's move to introduce customisable filters and AI to Xbox game chat marks a significant step forward in the fight against online abuse in gaming communities. By giving gamers more control over their chat experience and empowering them to report inappropriate behaviour, Microsoft is sending a clear message that it takes online safety seriously. While there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the potential for false positives, the new features represent a",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Preparations 'on track' for Glasgow 2014 Games,"In its first progress report, the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games organising committee has expressed confidence that preparations for the event are on track. The report, which was released earlier this week, highlighted the significant strides made in the development of competition venues and the installation of key infrastructure. One of the most notable developments has been the transformation of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) into a world-class arena capable of hosting a range of athletic and aquatic events. The SECC, which will serve as the centrepiece for the Games, is currently undergoing a Â£113 million expansion project to increase its capacity and improve its facilities. Elsewhere, the Â£25 million Tollcross International Swimming Centre is nearing completion and is expected to be fully operational by April 2014. The facility, which will play host to the swimming and diving competitions, has undergone a major refurbishment to bring it up to the required standard for the Commonwealth Games. Outside of the competition venues, work on the transport infrastructure required to support the Games is also progressing well. The M74 motorway extension, which will provide a direct link between Glasgow and the south of Scotland, is set to open in March 2014. The extension, which is a key component of the Games transport strategy, will help to alleviate traffic congestion and provide faster access to the city centre. In addition, the Glasgow Subway system is undergoing a Â£25 million upgrade to improve its reliability and expand its capacity. The upgraded system, which is due to be completed by the end of 2013, will provide a more efficient and convenient transport option for visitors to the Games. The report also highlighted the progress being made in the area of accommodation. The Glasgow 2014 accommodation strategy aims to provide a total of 11,000 beds for athletes and officials. To date, over 9,000 of these beds have been secured, with the remaining rooms expected to be confirmed in the coming months. The chair of the Glasgow 2014 organising committee, Lord Smith of Kelvin, expressed his satisfaction with the progress being made. ""This first progress report is a clear indication that the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games are on track,"" he said. ""The transformation of our competition venues, the investment in transport infrastructure and the provision of accommodation for our athletes and officials are all key elements of our preparations, and I am pleased to see that they are all progressing well."" With just over a year to go until the Games begin, the organising committee is focused on ensuring that all aspects of the preparation are completed on time and to the required standard. The next progress report is expected to be released in March 2014.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Merged Isle of Wight prison criticised in report,"An inspection of HMP Isle of Wight, carried out by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP), has revealed a number of concerning issues at the prison, located on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. Inspectors found that sanitation provision at the prison was ""degrading,"" with inadequate shower facilities and toilets, leading to unsanitary conditions. Additionally, in one wing, a quarter of prisoners were being kept in their cells during the day, which goes against the prison service's own guidelines that state prisoners should be out of their cells for at least 12 hours a day. The use of force at HMP Isle of Wight was also found to be high, with inspectors reporting that restraint techniques were being used excessively and inappropriately. In some cases, inmates were being held in cells for prolonged periods after being restrained, which further compounded the issue. Inmates at the prison were seeking sanctuary in the segregation unit, which is intended for prisoners who pose a risk to other inmates or prison staff. However, the unit was found to be overcrowded and inmates were being held in cells designed for single occupancy with multiple prisoners. This not only led to cramped conditions but also increased the risk of conflicts and incidents between prisoners. The report also highlighted issues with the prison's recording and reporting systems, which made it difficult for inspectors to fully understand the extent of the problems at the prison. Furthermore, there were concerns about the effectiveness of the prison's leadership and the lack of a clear strategy for improving conditions and reducing issues such as the use of force. In response to the report, the Ministry of Justice and the Prison Service have announced that they will be taking immediate action to address the issues raised by the inspectors. This includes investing in new shower facilities, improving the recording and reporting systems, and providing additional training for staff on the use of force and de-escalation techniques. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will also be conducting an independent investigation into the death of an inmate at HMP Isle of Wight in 2021, which the inspection report highlighted as a cause for concern. Peter Clarke, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, said, ""It is a priority that the issues we have identified are addressed, and we will be monitoring progress closely. We expect the Prison Service to take swift and decisive action to improve conditions at HMP Isle of Wight."" The findings of the inspection report will no doubt raise further questions about the state of the prison system in England and Wales, and the need for continued investment and reform to ensure that prisoners are treated with dignity and respect.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: MPs see surge in online petition numbers,"In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the role of online petitions in voicing public concern and demanding action from policymakers has gained significant attention. The digital platform has provided a means for individuals to collectively express their grievances and draw attention to important issues that may have been overlooked by politicians. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, who chairs the Petitions Committee, acknowledged the importance of these petitions in a recent statement. She highlighted that popular petitions have raised critical issues such as sick pay for the self-employed and pay rises for NHS workers â two matters that have been at the forefront of public debate during the crisis. McKinnell continued by expressing her admiration for the ""passion and commitment"" displayed by petition creators and signatories. She emphasized the Petitions Committee's commitment to ensuring that these concerns are heard in Parliament and that they ""will respond appropriately."" The Petitions Committee is not unique in its response to online petitions. Other parliamentary committees have also taken notice of the digital wave and have taken steps to engage with the public. For instance, the Work and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the government's response to petitions related to universal credit and employment support during the pandemic. The surge in petition numbers can be attributed to the accessibility and ease of use of digital platforms during lockdowns and social distancing measures. According to McKinnell, the Petitions Committee received over 1,000 petitions during the first wave of the crisis alone. This represents a significant increase compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, the impact of these petitions extends beyond the halls of Parliament. They also serve as a catalyst for public awareness and engagement. For example, the petition calling for a Clap for Carers initiative received over five million signatures and ultimately led to Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraging the public to show their appreciation for key workers every Thursday at 8 pm. The power of petitions is not new, but their significance in the digital age cannot be understated. They offer a democratic platform for citizens to express their views and demand action, ultimately holding politicians accountable to the needs and concerns of their constituents. In conclusion, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of online petitions as a tool for public engagement and advocacy. As McKinnell noted, ""Parliament must continue to be open to the concerns of the public, and we will work to ensure that this remains the case."" It is a testament to the power of the digital age and the collective voice of the people that they can effect change, even in the most challenging of times.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stafford and Cannock hospitals' services 'unsustainable',"Recommendations that Stafford Hospital and Cannock Chase Hospital should be downgraded have been made in a report for healthcare regulator Monitor. The report, which was commissioned in response to concerns about the sustainability of services at both hospitals, suggested that some services should be carried out by neighbouring trusts. The most significant recommendation was for maternity services at both hospitals to be transferred to the University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. The report highlighted concerns about the low number of births at both hospitals, which it said made it difficult to maintain a sustainable service. Monitor also recommended that certain surgical services, including urology and gynaecology, should be transferred to the Royal Wolverhampton and Walsall Hospitals NHS Trust. The report cited concerns about the low volume of procedures being carried out at Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals, which made it difficult to maintain the required level of expertise. The report also raised concerns about the financial sustainability of both hospitals. It highlighted the fact that Stafford Hospital had been in financial deficit for the past six years, while Cannock Chase Hospital had a deficit of Â£6.5 million in 2018/19. Monitor said that the financial challenges at both hospitals were making it difficult for them to invest in necessary improvements. Monitor's report came as no surprise to local campaigners, who have been calling for changes to be made to the hospitals for some time. The Save Our Stafford Hospital campaign, which was launched in 2013, has been fighting to prevent the downgrade of services at Stafford Hospital. The campaign has highlighted the importance of having a full range of services available locally, particularly for elderly and vulnerable patients. However, the recommendations have been met with opposition from some quarters. The Labour Party has criticised the government for failing to invest in the hospitals in the first place, and has called for a review of the funding formula used to distribute resources to health trusts. Some local residents have also expressed concern about the potential impact of the downgrade on their communities. Despite the controversy, Monitor has said that it is now up to the hospitals' trusts to decide how to respond to the recommendations. The trusts have until the end of March to submit their response to Monitor. In the meantime, patients and staff at both hospitals are awaiting developments with uncertainty. While some will welcome the prospect of improved services, others are fearful of the unknown. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that significant change is on the horizon for Stafford and Cannock hospitals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fears raised 'free NHS' will come to an end,"By Nick Triggle, Health correspondent, BBC News Nearly half of the 78 health and and care leaders surveyed by the Nuffield Trust felt the status quo in the NHS would not be sustainable in the long term, and raised fears that the ""free at the point of use"" system could come to an end. The Nuffield Trust, an independent health think tank, said its annual survey of senior figures in the health and care sector painted a picture of ""deepening concerns"" about the future of the NHS. One in five of those surveyed said they believed the NHS as they knew it would end within the next 10 years. And more than 40% said they were concerned that the government's plans for health and social care would lead to the end of the principle of free care at the point of use. The survey comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited health and social care reforms in the coming weeks. The plans are expected to include measures to increase the role of the private sector in delivering care, and could see more charges for some aspects of care. Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said the survey results showed a ""significant shift in attitudes"" towards the NHS among senior figures. ""The NHS has always been a challenging organisation to run, but the pressures it faces today are arguably greater than at any other time in its history,"" he said. ""The pandemic has laid bare the fundamental challenges facing the health service, including a workforce that is overstretched and underpaid, and a system that is struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population."" The survey also highlighted concerns about the workforce, with 65% of respondents saying they were worried about the number of vacancies in their organisation. This was up from 53% last year. And more than 80% of respondents said they were concerned about the morale of their staff, with many citing low pay, long hours and a lack of support as major issues. The Nuffield Trust said the findings underlined the need for the government to take urgent action to address the challenges facing the NHS. ""The health and care sector needs a clear plan for how it will respond to the deepening challenges it faces - from workforce issues to financial sustainability,"" Mr Edwards said. ""The government's upcoming plans for health and social care reform will be critical in setting the direction of travel for the NHS over the coming years. But it's important that these plans are based on a clear understanding of the challenges facing the health service, and are backed up by the necessary resources and investment.""

Being a couch potato could be genetic say Aberdeen scientists,"Scientists from Aberdeen University, in collaboration with researchers from China, have been delving into the intricacies of why some individuals exhibit a stronger propensity towards a sedentary lifestyle and an inclination to gain weight. The team revealed that they had identified a specific genetic mutation that could potentially contribute to these behaviors. The researchers zeroed in on a particular gene, known as FTO (Fat Mass and Obesity Associated), which is well-known for its role in regulating body weight and metabolism. This gene has previously been linked to obesity and a reduced inclination towards physical activity. However, the Aberdeen-based scientists made a groundbreaking discovery within this gene. They identified a specific mutation, which they named rs9939609, that seems to exacerbate the gene's effects. Individuals carrying this mutation are said to have lower levels of a protein called alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH), which is produced in the brain and known to promote feelings of satiety and suppress appetite. This deficiency in Î±-MSH can lead to individuals eating more than they need, contributing to weight gain and a reduced motivation to engage in physical activities. The scientists speculate that this genetic predisposition could explain why some people find it more challenging to maintain a healthy lifestyle than others. The team's findings were published in the renowned scientific journal, Nature Genetics. The researchers emphasized that while the genetic factor plays a role, it does not absolve individuals of their responsibility to lead a healthy lifestyle. They encouraged everyone to maintain a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity, regardless of their genetic makeup. The study also offered some insights into the potential benefits of weight loss interventions. The researchers found that individuals carrying the mutation showed greater weight loss when undergoing lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise. This suggests that personalized weight loss programs, tailored to an individual's genetic profile, could be an effective strategy for helping people overcome their genetic predispositions and lead healthier lives. The scientists acknowledged that further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between genetics and lifestyle choices. Nevertheless, their findings provide valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of sedentary behaviors and offer new avenues for developing personalized weight loss interventions. The team's research represents a significant step forward in our understanding of why some people struggle more than others to maintain a healthy lifestyle. By shedding light on the genetic factors at play, the researchers hope to pave the way for more effective interventions and ultimately help more people overcome their genetic predispositions and lead healthier lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Poster wars breaking out across Europe,"By Piers Scholfield, BBC News, Brussels In Britain, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) has certainly got the publicity it was hoping for from its new poster campaign - and expects it to translate into electoral gains. The posters, which feature Prime Minister David Cameron with the caption ""I want to be a Romanian"" above an image of a Romanian worker, have ignited a heated debate about immigration and national identity. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has defended the campaign, insisting that it is a ""reasoned and sensible"" response to public concerns. But while the UKIP posters have dominated the headlines in Britain, they are not the only controversial campaign to emerge in Europe in recent weeks. Poster wars have broken out across the continent, as political parties and interest groups seek to make their voices heard in the run-up to national elections and the European Parliament elections in May. In France, the far-right National Front has used posters to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment, with one campaign featuring a picture of a Syrian refugee with the caption ""Merci, CETA, pour l'immigration massives [sic]"" - a reference to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada. The National Front has also used posters to target President Francois Hollande, with one campaign featuring a large image of the president's face and the words ""France is not for sale."" In Germany, the anti-Islam Pegida movement has used posters to spread its message of anti-immigration and anti-Islam sentiment. One poster features a picture of a mosque with the caption ""Islam is not a part of Germany,"" while another features a picture of a woman in a burka with the words ""We are the people - against Islamic terror."" In Sweden, the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing party with neo-Nazi roots, has used posters to target refugees and immigrants. One campaign features a picture of a man holding a sign that reads ""No to mass immigration"" and another shows a group of young men with the caption ""You're not welcome here."" The poster wars have sparked condemnation from human rights organizations and political leaders. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for an end to the ""xenophobic and racist"" campaigns, while the European Parliament's anti-discrimination agency, the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, has said that the posters ""risk perpetuating harmful stereotypes and increasing divisiveness."" Despite the criticism, however, there is little sign that the poster wars will come to an end anytime soon. With national elections and the European Parliament elections just around the corner, political parties and interest groups are likely to continue using provocative posters to make their points and win over voters.

Viagogo threatened with fresh court action,"By Simon Read, Personal Finance Reporter The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took Viagogo to court last year for breaking consumer protection law. The ticket seller was given a deadline of 17 January to make necessary changes to its business practices or face further legal action. However, the CMA has now announced that it intends to bring fresh court proceedings against Viagogo due to concerns that the company has failed to comply with the court orders and the undertakings it gave during the original case. The CMA's concerns centre around the clarity and prominence of fees and charges when consumers buy tickets from Viagogo. The watchdog argues that these fees are not always clear to consumers at the point of purchase, leading to misleading pricing. In a statement, the CMA said: ""We've issued Viagogo with a further final warning and intend to apply to the courts for an injunction and a penalty for non-compliance. We will continue to take action to protect consumers from being misled by Viagogo and other secondary ticketing platforms."" The CMA first launched its investigation into Viagogo in 2015, and in 2018 the company was found to have breached consumer protection law by misleading consumers about the availability and ticket prices. The CMA ordered Viagogo to make significant changes to its business practices and pay a Â£2.1m penalty. However, the CMA has now revealed that it has received evidence suggesting that Viagogo has continued to mislead consumers and has failed to comply with the court orders and the undertakings it gave during the original case. The CMA's concerns come as the secondary ticketing market continues to grow in size and complexity. Secondary ticketing platforms allow consumers to buy and sell tickets for events that have already been sold out or for which they may not have been able to secure tickets directly from the primary seller. However, these platforms have been criticised for their lack of transparency and the high fees they charge, which can add significant costs to the price of the ticket. The CMA has previously warned consumers to be wary of these fees and to check the authenticity of tickets before buying them from secondary sellers. The CMA's decision to bring fresh court proceedings against Viagogo is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to regulate the secondary ticketing market and to protect consumers from being misled. It is also a reminder that the CMA will not hesitate to take action against companies that fail to comply with the law and the undertakings they have given. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The CMA's actions are part of a broader effort to regulate the secondary ticketing market and to protect consumers from being misled. In 2019, the government announced plans to introduce new legislation to ensure that secondary ticketing platforms are more transparent and that consumers are given",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: New Bank of England boss pledges prompt action,"Faisal Islam, Economics editor @faisalislam on Twitter Andrew Bailey took over from current Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Monday, pledging prompt action in response to the economic challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking hours after the US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and the Bank of England alongside other central banks followed suit, Mr Bailey acknowledged the uncertainty facing the global economy. ""The economy is currently facing an unprecedented shock, and it's vital that we respond in an appropriate way,"" he said during his first press conference as governor. ""We will take all necessary steps to support the economy, and we will do so in a timely and effective manner."" Mr Bailey's comments came as the Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25%, joining the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and other central banks in an coordinated move to ease financial conditions and support economic growth. The Bank of England also announced a new programme of purchases of UK government bonds, aimed at keeping long-term borrowing costs low for businesses and households. Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank would use ""all the tools at its disposal"" to support the economy. The coronavirus outbreak has caused widespread disruption to global supply chains, leading to a sharp slowdown in economic activity. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy could experience its worst recession since the 1930s. Mr Bailey acknowledged that the economic outlook was uncertain, but he expressed confidence that the UK economy would recover once the outbreak was brought under control. ""The UK economy is fundamentally strong, and it will bounce back once the public health situation improves,"" he said. The Bank of England's monetary policy decisions are just one part of the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a package of measures aimed at supporting businesses and households, including grants to small businesses and an increase in universal credit payments. Mr Bailey said that he would work closely with the government to ensure that the central bank's actions were coordinated with other policies aimed at supporting the economy. ""We are all in this together, and we will work together to get through this challenging period,"" he said. Mr Bailey's appointment as Bank of England governor came after a lengthy selection process, during which he faced questions about his handling of the mortgage market during the 2008 financial crisis. He assured reporters on Monday that he was prepared for the challenges ahead. ""I am ready for the job, and I am looking forward to working with the Bank of England team to support the UK economy,"" he said.

NHS contaminated blood scandal victims urged to come forward,"Thousands of lives were irrevocably changed after being infected with HIV and hepatitis C from contaminated blood, following blood transfusions and other treatments in the National Health Service (NHS) during the 1970s and 1980s. The devastating consequences of this scandal, which has cast a long and dark shadow over the NHS, have left many victims and their families seeking answers, justice, and compensation for over three decades. After years of tireless campaigning by the families and survivors, along with numerous parliamentary inquiries and reports, it has been announced that Parliament will finally set out the terms for a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The announcement, made by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, came as a result of persistent pressure from campaigners and political figures, who have long called for an independent investigation into the events that led to the infection of thousands of people. The inquiry, which is expected to begin later this year, will examine the circumstances surrounding the contaminated blood scandal, including how and why the blood was contaminated, how it came to be used in the NHS, and why those affected were not informed of the risks in a timely manner. It will also consider the response of the government and the NHS to the crisis, and the support provided to the victims and their families. The announcement has been welcomed by campaigners and victims' groups, who have long called for a full and independent inquiry into the scandal. According to the Haemophilia Society, an estimated 4,500 people in the UK were infected with HIV and around 10,000 with hepatitis C through contaminated blood during the 1970s and 1980s. Many of those infected were haemophiliacs, who required regular blood transfusions to manage their condition. The contaminated blood scandal is considered one of the worst disasters in the history of the NHS, and its long-lasting impact on the lives of those affected continues to be felt. The physical and emotional toll on victims and their families, as well as the financial burden of treatment and care, has been immense. The inquiry is expected to provide answers and a measure of closure for those affected, as well as recommendations for preventing similar incidents from happening again. The Prime Minister's announcement of the inquiry comes as a result of years of tireless campaigning by victims, their families, and campaign groups, who have long called for justice and accountability. The inquiry is a significant step towards ensuring that those affected by the contaminated blood scandal receive the answers, support, and compensation they deserve, and that such a tragedy never happens again. As the inquiry begins, it is important that all those who were affected come forward and share their experiences. It is a chance for their voices to be heard, for their stories to be told, and for the truth to",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Julia Gillard grilled on Rudd ousting 'victory speech',"Ms Gillard, who took office in June 2010, had said she took the decision to challenge Mr Rudd on the day itself. But an explosive interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) 7.30 program has raised fresh questions about the circumstances surrounding her leadership coup. In the interview, which aired on Monday night, former Labor colleague and cabinet minister Craig Emerson revealed that he had been contacted by Ms Gillard's supporters on the morning of the leadership ballot. Mr Emerson, who was a key Rudd supporter and served as the Finance Minister under Rudd before defecting to Ms Gillard's camp, claimed that he was contacted before Mr Rudd had been informed of the challenge. ""I was contacted by someone, I won't name them, who said, 'We've got the numbers,'"" Mr Emerson said. ""I said, 'I don't believe that. It's not possible.' But they were insistent, and I said, 'Well, you'd better tell the Prime Minister.' It was clear to me that the Prime Minister was not aware of the situation."" Ms Gillard had previously claimed that she had acted alone in her decision to challenge Mr Rudd, and that she had only made the call after consulting with her close advisors. However, her account has been called into question by a number of former Labor MPs, who have claimed that they were approached by Ms Gillard's supporters before the ballot. The interview with Mr Emerson comes just days before the 10th anniversary of Ms Gillard's victory in the leadership ballot. In her victory speech, delivered on June 23, 2010, Ms Gillard vowed to unite the party and lead it to victory at the next election. ""I am determined to lead a united Labor Party and to lead a strong and effective government,"" she said at the time. ""I am determined to work with all members of the Labor Party and with all Australians to build a better future for our country."" However, Ms Gillard's leadership was short-lived. She was ousted as prime minister in 2013, following a series of political missteps and a poor showing in opinion polls. The latest revelations about the circumstances surrounding her leadership coup are likely to fuel renewed debate about Ms Gillard's tenure as prime minister, and whether she had acted ethically in challenging Mr Rudd. For his part, Mr Emerson has defended his decision to switch sides, saying that he believed that Ms Gillard was the best person to lead the party at the time. ""I believe that I made the right decision, and I believe that history will vindicate that decision,"" he said. But for many Australians, the controversy surrounding Ms Gillard's leadership coup remains a contentious issue, and one that",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mystery of the botched kidnap of a millionaire hotelier on the French Riviera,"By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Jacqueline Veyrac, millionaire proprietor of the Grand Hotel in Cannes, was seized last Monday on a street in central Nice. Two days later she was found, disheveled but otherwise unharmed, in a railway station in the nearby town of Antibes. The mystery of her botched kidnap continues to baffle French investigators. The kidnap attempt took place at around 4 pm on a busy shopping street in Nice. Witnesses reported seeing a grey Peugeot 308, with tinted windows, blocking the pavement. Two men, dressed in black and wearing ski masks, emerged from the vehicle and approached Madame Veyrac, who was on her way to a meeting. One of them grabbed her by the arm, while the other brandished a gun. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of â¬5 million, payable in cash. They provided a mobile number for negotiations and left the scene in the Peugeot. But within hours, the police were on the trail. The getaway car had been rented under false documents, and the mobile number used for negotiations was traced to an address in the Marseille suburb of La Martine. A police raid on the address on Tuesday morning resulted in the arrest of three suspects. One of them, a man in his early 30s, admitted to being involved in the kidnap attempt. But the others remained silent, and no ransom money was found. Madame Veyrac was located on Tuesday evening, having managed to escape from her captors during a stop at a railway station. The suspect in custody has since provided some details of the plot. He claimed that the kidnap was the brainchild of a local criminal gang, who had hoped to make a large profit from the ransom. But it seems that things went badly wrong from the start. The getaway car was spotted by the police hours after the kidnap, and the gang was forced to abandon their plans. Madame Veyrac was left unharmed, but shaken by the ordeal. The police are continuing their investigations, and it is hoped that further arrests will follow. But for now, the mystery of the botched kidnap of the millionaire hotelier on the French Riviera remains unsolved. The incident has caused shockwaves in the local community. Madame Veyrac is a well-known figure in Cannes, and her abduction has been widely condemned. The police have assured the public that they are doing everything in their power to bring the perpetrators to justice. But for now, the case remains open, and the people of Nice and Cannes will be watching closely to see how it unfolds.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Search under way for monkeys missing from Belfast zoo,"Search continues for Two Missing Lion-tailed Macaques at Belfast Zoo Six lion-tailed macaques managed to get out of their enclosure at Belfast Zoo on Monday, causing quite a stir among staff and visitors. Four of the primates have since been safely returned to their habitat, but the search continues for the remaining two. The macaques, a rare and endangered species native to South India, are known for their distinctive crest of white fur on their heads. They are social animals that live in groups and are usually quite easy to spot within their enclosure. But on Monday, they managed to escape, leaving zoo officials and keepers scrambling to locate them. The four macaques that were found were tranquilized and returned to their enclosure. However, the search for the other two continues. Zoo officials have appealed to the public for help in locating the missing primates. ""We are appealing to anyone who may have seen the missing macaques in the grounds of the zoo or in the local area to contact us,"" a spokesperson for the zoo said. ""They are a rare and endangered species, and we are very concerned for their welfare."" The lion-tailed macaques are highly intelligent animals, known for their agility and dexterity. They can move quickly through trees and are adept at climbing. This makes them difficult to locate, especially if they have managed to leave the zoo grounds. The zoo is working closely with local animal welfare organizations and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to locate the missing primates. They have also increased security measures around the enclosure to prevent any further escapes. ""We are taking this incident very seriously,"" the zoo spokesperson continued. ""The safety and welfare of our animals is our top priority. We are doing everything we can to locate the missing macaques and return them to their home."" Lion-tailed macaques are considered to be critically endangered, with fewer than 2,500 individuals remaining in the wild. They are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting for the pet trade. Belfast Zoo is home to several endangered species, and the staff take great care in ensuring their welfare. This incident serves as a reminder of the challenges they face in protecting these animals. Anyone with information about the missing lion-tailed macaques is urged to contact Belfast Zoo directly. The zoo can be reached at +44 28 9075 1582. The search for the missing macaques continues, and the zoo staff remains hopeful that they will be found soon. In the meantime, they are reminding visitors to keep a lookout for any sightings of the rare primates and to report any information to the zoo.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: UK foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn amid economic downturn,"It said a review of aid projects conducted by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has prioritised the most vulnerable countries for assistance, despite a significant cut to the UK's foreign aid spending. The reduction in spending, amounting to Â£2.9 billion, was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, in his autumn spending review. The economic downturn brought about by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic necessitated the reduction. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, however, assured that the UK would still meet its legal obligations to spend 0.7% of its gross national income on foreign aid, although this would not be achieved until 2023. He stressed that the government's primary focus was on supporting the British people through the crisis. The FCDO review, according to Raab, aimed to ensure that every pound spent on aid was used effectively and efficiently. It has identified projects that would have the most significant impact in addressing poverty and promoting economic growth, particularly in the poorest and most vulnerable countries. These projects would continue to receive funding, while others, deemed less essential, would be paused or terminated. The international community has expressed concern over the UK's decision to cut foreign aid spending, with some arguing that it goes against the spirit of global cooperation during a crisis. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) urged rich countries to maintain their aid commitments, stating that it was crucial to help the world's most vulnerable populations. The UK government's position has drawn criticism from opposition parties and aid organisations. They argue that the UK, with its significant economic resources, has a moral obligation to support the global effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic and alleviate suffering in the developing world. Despite the controversy, Raab emphasised that the UK's commitment to its international responsibilities remained unwavering. He reiterated that the UK would continue to provide humanitarian aid, support global health initiatives, and contribute to multilateral institutions. Raab also highlighted the UK's efforts to lead the global response to the pandemic, including the provision of more than Â£1.3 billion in aid and the deployment of medical teams and expertise to affected countries. As the world grapples with the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the UK's decision to cut foreign aid spending has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the UK's resources should be focused on its own population, others maintain that the UK has a moral and ethical obligation to help those in need, particularly during a global health crisis. The government's position will continue to be scrutinised as it navigates the challenges posed by the pandemic and the economic downturn.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rooney mania grips Tanzania as Everton play Gor Mahia,"By Stanley Kwenda, BBC Africa, Dar es Salaam Rooney had the first touch of the game between Everton and Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia and scored after 35 minutes, lifting the capacity crowd at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam to their feet. The goal was a moment of pure magic, as the English Premier League legend controlled the ball with a deft touch before unleashing a powerful left-footed shot that left the Gor Mahia goalkeeper rooted to the spot. The goal marked the beginning of what has become known as ""Rooney mania"" in Tanzania. The crowd went wild as the former Manchester United and England captain celebrated with his teammates. Rooney's presence in the Tanzanian capital had generated immense excitement, and the sell-out crowd had turned out in droves to witness the spectacle. The 35-year-old striker had been brought in by Everton to boost their pre-season preparations, and the decision to include Tanzania in their itinerary was seen as a masterstroke. The Tanzanian Football Federation had pulled out all the stops to ensure that the game was a success, with the stadium decked out in Everton colors and banners displaying Rooney's image adorning the stands. As the game continued, Rooney's every move was met with rapturous applause from the crowd. He was a living legend, a player whose fame had transcended borders and reached the shores of East Africa. The Tanzanian fans had come to see a hero, and they were not disappointed. Rooney's goal had given Everton a commanding lead, and they went on to win the game comfortably, with the crowd cheering and chanting long after the final whistle had blown. For the Tanzanian fans, it was a moment they would never forget, a moment that had brought them closer to the world of international football. As Rooney and his teammates made their way off the pitch, the crowd continued to sing and dance, their voices echoing through the night. The English striker had left a lasting impression on the Tanzanian fans, and his goal had ignited a newfound passion for football in the heart of Africa. The impact of Rooney's visit was felt long after the game. The Tanzanian media was filled with stories and images of the iconic striker, and his name became a household name in the country. For a moment, Tanzania had been the center of the footballing world, and the memory of Rooney's goal would remain etched in the hearts and minds of the Tanzanian fans for years to come.

Ants use Sun and memories to navigate,"By Helen Briggs, BBC News Scientists have discovered that ants use the sun and their memories to navigate, enabling them to find their way to food sources and back to their colonies, even when facing in unfamiliar directions. It is the latest insight into the complex behaviours of these tiny creatures, which have long been admired for their impressive ability to work together and build intricate structures. Researchers from the University of Sydney in Australia studied the Argentine ant, which lives in large, wandering colonies that can travel up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) a year in search of food and water. The ants were placed in a maze with food at one end and their nest at the other. Despite being turned around so they could only see the walls of the maze, they were able to find their way to the food and back, proving they could follow a compass route, regardless of the direction in which they were facing. The scientists believe the ants use the position of the sun to orientate themselves. They also use landmarks and memories of the terrain to help them navigate. ""Ants are able to integrate information from the sun with the information from their environment to find their way home,"" said Dr. Andrew Schultz, who led the study. ""This is the first time anyone has shown that ants are able to use the sun as a compass when they are disoriented, and it's a really important finding because it shows that ants are actually using multiple cues to navigate."" The discovery could help scientists better understand how animals navigate and find their way in unfamiliar environments. It could also have practical applications, such as in developing new technologies for robots and drones that can navigate autonomously. The researchers are now investigating how other insects and animals use the sun and other cues to navigate, and how they adapt to changing environments. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding the complex behaviour of ants and other animals,"" said Dr. Schultz. ""By studying how they navigate and find their way, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of behaviour and cognition, and develop new technologies that can help us solve real-world problems."" The study, published in the journal Behavioural Ecology, adds to a growing body of research on the remarkable abilities of ants. Previous studies have shown that they can use pheromones to communicate with each other, coordinate their movements to build complex structures, and even farm fungi for food. Despite their small size and simple appearance, ants are a complex and fascinating group of organisms, and their behaviours continue to surprise and inspire researchers around the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lifespan gap 'widening between rich and poor',"By Judith Burns, BBC News Everyone is living longer, but the gap in lifespan between the rich and the poor is widening, according to a new study from City University London. Better life expectancy narrowed the gap in the early 20th Century, but the trend has reversed in the last few decades. The research, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, highlights the growing divide between socioeconomic groups. ""We've seen a decrease in the gap during the 20th Century, but that trend has been reversed since the 1980s,"" said Dr. Alissa Goodman, lead author of the study. The researchers analyzed data from more than 30 million deaths in England and Wales between 1981 and 2016. They found that, while overall life expectancy increased, the gap between the richest and poorest continued to widen. The difference in life expectancy between the top and bottom 1% of earners in England and Wales was around 10 years in the 1980s. Today, it's more than 14 years. The gap is even wider in other countries, with the difference between the richest and poorest in the US being around 15 years. The reasons for this trend are complex, but the researchers point to a number of factors. These include poorer education, unhealthy diets, and lack of access to healthcare for those in lower socioeconomic groups. ""The causes of this gap are multifaceted and interrelated,"" Dr. Goodman said. ""They include things like education, diet, and access to healthcare, as well as the social determinants of health, such as employment and social support."" The study also highlights the impact of economic inequality on public health. ""Economic inequality not only reduces overall population health, but it also increases the health gap between the rich and the poor,"" Dr. Goodman said. The researchers call for policies that address the root causes of economic inequality and improve access to healthcare, education, and other resources for those in lower socioeconomic groups. ""We need to address the underlying causes of economic inequality if we want to reduce the health gap between the rich and the poor,"" Dr. Goodman said. ""This will require a comprehensive approach that includes investments in education, healthcare, and social support, as well as policies that address income inequality and poverty."" The study adds to a growing body of evidence that highlights the negative impact of economic inequality on public health. It also underscores the urgency of addressing this issue if we want to create a fairer and healthier society for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Dulwich Picture Gallery's 'fake' painting revealed,"Since February, Jean-Honore Fragonard's 18th Century masterpiece, Young Woman, has been a subject of intrigue and confusion at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. Replacing the original work, which was lent by the Wallace Collection, was a counterfeit produced in China. The public was asked to visit the gallery and share their thoughts on the authenticity of the replacement. The revelation of the forgery sent shockwaves through the art world. Young Woman, a delicate and exquisite painting, is a cherished piece in Fragonard's oeuvre. It depicts a young woman sitting in a garden, lost in thought, with a parrot perched on a nearby branch. The painting's intricate brushstrokes and rich colors have long captivated art lovers. The forgery, which was discovered during routine inspections, was a crude imitation of the original. Its colors were dull, and its brushstrokes were uneven. The parrot in the forgery was painted with a heavy hand, and its features were blurred. Despite these obvious differences, some visitors were unsure if the painting was a fake. ""I thought it looked a bit off, but I wasn't completely sure,"" said one visitor, who requested anonymity. ""The colors didn't seem as vibrant as I remembered, but I thought it might just be the lighting in the gallery."" Others were more certain of the forgery's authenticity. ""The brushstrokes were all wrong,"" said another visitor. ""They were too heavy, and there was no finesse to them. It was clear that this was not the work of Fragonard."" The gallery's director, Jennifer Scott, expressed her disappointment at the discovery. ""We are deeply sorry for any confusion or misinformation that this may have caused,"" she said in a statement. ""We take the authenticity of our collections very seriously, and we are working closely with the relevant authorities to investigate the origin of the forgery."" The forgery is believed to have been produced in China, where a thriving market for art forgeries exists. The painting was obtained through a third-party dealer, and the gallery is currently investigating how it came into their possession. The discovery of the forgery has sparked a renewed interest in Young Woman, with many visitors flocking to the gallery to see the original painting. The incident has also highlighted the importance of provenance and the need for rigorous authentication procedures in the art world. As the investigation continues, the gallery remains committed to transparency and accountability. ""We will keep the public updated on any developments in this matter,"" said Jennifer Scott.

Eating disorders 'starting at a younger age',"By Anthony Baxter Revealed, the investigative journalism team at the BBC, recently partnered with Beat, an organisation which supports people with eating disorders, to shed light on the alarming trend of younger individuals developing these complex and life-threatening conditions. Beat posted a question on their website asking, ""Why are more young people developing eating disorders, and what can be done to prevent it?"" It is a question that resonates with many families and healthcare professionals. According to Beat, around 725,000 people in the UK are currently suffering from an eating disorder, with as many as 11% of those being under the age of 16. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders has been steadily increasing over the past decade. The causes of eating disorders in young people are complex and multifaceted. Some experts suggest that societal pressure to conform to unrealistic body ideals, as perpetuated by social media and the entertainment industry, plays a significant role. Others point to genetic predispositions, trauma, mental health issues, and stress as potential factors. One thing is clear: eating disorders do not discriminate. They can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or socioeconomic background. However, research shows that certain groups are at higher risk, including girls and women, those from a younger age, and individuals with a history of mental health issues. So, what can be done to prevent more young people from developing eating disorders? One approach is to focus on early intervention and education. Schools, healthcare providers, and community organisations can all play a role in raising awareness about eating disorders and providing resources for those who may be at risk. This might include training teachers and healthcare professionals to recognise the signs and symptoms of eating disorders, and providing support groups and counselling services for young people. Another important step is to challenge societal norms around body image and promote healthy, inclusive attitudes towards food and weight. This might involve media campaigns, public education initiatives, and community-based projects that promote body positivity and healthy eating habits. Ultimately, preventing eating disorders in young people will require a concerted effort from individuals, communities, and governments. It will take time, resources, and a commitment to understanding the complex causes of these conditions and addressing them in a holistic, compassionate way. But with the right support and resources, it is possible to make a difference and help more young people grow up healthy, happy, and free from the burden of eating disorders. If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, there is help available.

Kronospan Chirk biomass plans vote deferred for site visit,"Kronospan, the international manufacturer of wood-based panels, has requested that a vote on its biomass plans for its Chirk site be deferred to allow for a site visit by planning committee members. The proposal, which includes the construction of a new biomass power plant to provide renewable energy for the factory and secure the future of around 600 jobs, has been met with some opposition from local councillors. In a statement, Kronospan said that the plant would not only provide sustainable energy for its operations but also reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 55,000 tonnes per year. The company has emphasized the importance of the project, not only for the local community but also for the wider region, as it would contribute significantly to the economy and help the area move towards a more sustainable future. However, some local councillors have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the plant on the environment, particularly in relation to air quality and noise levels. They have called on members of Monday's planning committee to visit the site before making a decision on the application. One councillor, who wished to remain anonymous, said that while they understood the importance of the project for the local economy, they could not support it without first seeing the proposed site and speaking to local residents. The councillor added that they believed a site visit would provide valuable insights into the potential impact of the plant on the community and the environment. Another councillor, Cllr. Jones, has publicly voiced her opposition to the plans, stating that she was concerned about the potential for increased traffic to the site and the impact of the plant on local property values. She has also expressed her concern about the potential for increased emissions from the plant, despite Kronospan's claims that it would reduce overall emissions. The deferral of the vote is expected to cause some delays in the project, which has already faced several setbacks due to the ongoing pandemic and planning issues. However, Kronospan remains optimistic, with a spokesperson stating that the company was confident that the committee would make an informed decision once they had visited the site and considered all the evidence. The decision to defer the vote comes as the UK government continues to prioritize the transition to renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions. The biomass plant at Chirk could be an important step in this direction, providing sustainable energy for a major industrial site while also securing local jobs. However, the concerns of local councillors and residents must also be addressed, and a site visit is seen as a crucial step in this process. As the planning committee prepares to visit the site, all eyes will be on the decision they ultimately make. With the potential to secure 600 jobs, reduce carbon emissions, and contribute to a more sustainable future, the outcome of this vote could have significant implications for the local community and beyond.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Gamekeepers' knowledge benefits eagles, says SGA","The Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) has highlighted the significant benefits that gamekeepers' knowledge and practices bring to the conservation of eagles and other birds of prey. The association acknowledged that persecution was an issue and it had recently expelled four members for wildlife offenses. However, it emphasized that the conservation work being carried out by many grouse managers was often being overlooked. According to the SGA, a survey of keeper-managed moors in Scotland, conducted in collaboration with Scottish Natural Heritage and RSPB Scotland, revealed that there had been a notable increase in the number of breeding pairs of golden eagles and hen harriers. These birds of prey are often seen as indicators of the health of the wider ecosystem. The survey also showed that the presence of gamekeepers on these estates had led to a reduction in the numbers of rabbits and hares, which can be a significant food source for golden eagles and other raptors. By controlling the population of these prey species, gamekeepers were able to provide a more stable food source and reduce competition, thereby benefiting the eagles and other birds of prey. Moreover, gamekeepers were found to be actively monitoring the nests of birds of prey, ensuring that any disturbance was minimized and that chicks were protected from predation. This proactive approach had led to a significant increase in the number of successful breeding attempts. The survey also highlighted the important role that gamekeepers play in the management of forests and woodlands. By creating and maintaining a mosaic of habitats, including open areas, woodlands, and scrub, gamekeepers were able to provide a range of nesting and foraging opportunities for birds of prey, as well as other species. The SGA also highlighted the importance of collaboration between gamekeepers, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders in the management of Scotland's moors. This collaborative approach had led to a better understanding of the needs of different species and the implementation of effective conservation measures. However, the SGA acknowledged that there was still work to be done to address the issue of persecution of birds of prey. It called on all stakeholders to work together to tackle this issue and to promote a culture of respect for all wildlife. In conclusion, the SGA's survey highlights the significant benefits that gamekeepers' knowledge and practices bring to the conservation of eagles and other birds of prey in Scotland. By implementing effective conservation measures and working in collaboration with other stakeholders, gamekeepers are able to create a stable and healthy ecosystem that benefits a range of species, including birds of prey. However, it is important that the issue of persecution of birds of prey is addressed in order to ensure that these important conservation efforts can continue to be effective.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Iraqi security forces 'abuse female prisoners',"Many were held for months or even years without charge, the report found, as the plight of female prisoners in Iraq's detention facilities came under the spotlight. The investigation, carried out by a coalition of human rights organizations, painted a harrowing picture of the abuse and mistreatment endured by women in the custody of Iraqi security forces. Interrogators often questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than the crimes in which they themselves were implicated, it said. This practice, which flew in the face of international law and basic human rights, was designed to pressure women into providing information about their male family members, often leading to further arrests and detentions. The report detailed numerous instances of physical and sexual abuse, including beatings, electric shocks, and rape. Women were subjected to humiliating body searches, and some were forced to strip naked in front of male guards. In some cases, women were held in cramped, unsanitary cells with inadequate food and water, leading to malnutrition and disease. The human rights organizations called for an immediate end to the abuse of female prisoners, urging the Iraqi government to launch an independent investigation into the matter. They demanded that those responsible for the abuses be held accountable and that measures be taken to ensure the safety and wellbeing of women in detention. The Iraqi government, for its part, expressed its commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the human rights of all citizens. However, the report's findings highlighted the need for concrete action to address the systemic issues that allow for the abuse of female prisoners to persist. The human rights organizations urged the international community to put pressure on the Iraqi government to take meaningful steps to address the issue. They called on the United Nations and other international bodies to monitor the situation in Iraq's detention facilities and to provide support and resources to help the Iraqi authorities reform their justice system. The plight of female prisoners in Iraq is just one aspect of a broader pattern of human rights abuses in the country. The report's findings underscore the need for sustained efforts to promote the rule of law, protect human rights, and build a more just and equitable society in Iraq. As the world watches with growing concern the situation in Iraq, it is essential that the Iraqi government takes concrete steps to address the abuse of female prisoners and to ensure that the human rights of all citizens are protected. The international community must continue to support these efforts and to hold the Iraqi authorities accountable for their actions. Only through a collective commitment to upholding the rule of law and promoting human rights can the people of Iraq build a brighter future for themselves and their country.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The Munros, mountains in Scotland over 3,000 feet high, are a popular challenge among hikers and climbers alike. Woods, a seasoned mountaineer, began his epic journey on December 26, 2021, and completed it on March 1, 2022. He faced numerous challenges during his 10-week endeavor, including extreme weather conditions, fatigue, and the ever-present danger of avalanches. Despite the difficulties, Woods remained determined to finish what he started. He climbed an average of four Munros per day, often in harsh conditions, to ensure he met his goal. ""It was a mental and physical challenge,"" Woods said. ""But every time I summited a Munro, I felt a sense of accomplishment that kept me going. I knew that if I could push through the tough moments, I would come out the other side a stronger person."" Woods' achievement has drawn praise from the mountaineering community in Scotland. The Scottish Mountaineering Club issued a statement congratulating him on his ""impressive feat."" ""Kevin's accomplishment is a testament to his dedication and determination,"" the statement read. ""His achievement is a source of inspiration for all of us in the mountaineering community."" Woods' journey was not without its setbacks. He was forced to turn back on several occasions due to dangerous conditions. But each setback only made him more determined to reach his goal. ""I knew there would be challenges along the way, but I never let them deter me,"" Woods said. ""I stayed focused on my goal and pushed through the tough moments."" Woods' achievement is all the more impressive when you consider that he climbed all 282 Munros without the use of a car or any form of mechanical assistance. He relied solely on his own strength and determination to reach each summit. ""I'm just a regular guy from Glasgow who loves the mountains,"" Woods said. ""But if I can do this, then anyone can.

Abellio Greater Anglia rail firm faces franchise challenge,"Abellio Greater Anglia currently runs the East Anglia franchise, but it is being re-let in October 2016. It includes services to Stansted Airport and to Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, Hertfordshire and Suffolk. Abellio, in a joint statement with the Department for Transport (DfT), announced that it would be bidding for the new franchise, which will run for up to 15 years. The current franchise, which began in November 2012, has seen significant improvements in the rail network. Passenger numbers have increased by 12% since 2012, and Abellio has invested over Â£1 billion in new trains and infrastructure. The company has also introduced new services, such as the Norwich to Cambridge line, and has increased the frequency of services on some routes. However, the franchise has not been without its challenges. Delays and cancellations have been a regular issue, particularly during peak hours and during periods of heavy rain. Passenger satisfaction levels have also been below average, with many complaining about overcrowding and poor customer service. The DfT has set out strict requirements for the new franchise, which includes a focus on improving passenger experience, increasing capacity and reducing delays. Abellio has pledged to invest an additional Â£1.5 billion in new trains, stations and infrastructure, as well as increasing the number of services and improving customer service. The company is also facing competition from other bidders, including Arriva and Keolis. Arriva, which currently operates the Northern and CrossCountry franchises, has promised to invest Â£1.8 billion in new trains and infrastructure, while Keolis has pledged to increase capacity by 30% and reduce journey times by 10%. The outcome of the bidding process is expected in the coming months. whichever company is successful will be responsible for running the East Anglia rail network until at least 2031. The new franchise is expected to come into effect in October 2019, giving the winning bidder just over a year to prepare for the handover. Despite the challenges, Abellio remains optimistic about its chances of retaining the franchise. ""We believe we have made significant progress over the past five years,"" said a spokesperson for the company.

Scrap dealer law aims to reduce metal theft,"All scrap dealers and motor salvage operators in England and Wales are now required by law to apply for a licence from their local authority and maintain detailed records of their transactions. This new regulation, which came into effect in October 2013, is part of the government's efforts to reduce metal theft and curb the illegal trade of stolen goods. The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013, which governs this legislation, mandates that every scrap metal dealer and motor salvage operator must register with their local council. The registration process involves providing proof of identity, business address, and insurance coverage. These dealers must also display their licence prominently at their premises, making it easy for customers and law enforcement officials to verify their legitimacy. Under the new rules, scrap dealers are required to request identification from sellers of scrap metal and keep detailed records of the sale, including the seller's name, address, and identification number. Dealers must also record the date, description, and quantity of the metal sold. These records must be kept for a minimum of three years and must be made available to the police upon request. The legislation also places new responsibilities on the police, who are required to maintain a database of all registered dealers and their contact details. The police can use this database to check the authenticity of scrap metal being sold and to investigate any potential cases of metal theft. Dealers are obliged to report any suspicious transactions to the police. The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 was introduced following a rise in metal thefts, particularly of copper and lead, from churches, schools, and other public buildings. The theft of these metals can cause significant damage and disruption, and the cost of repairs can run into thousands of pounds. By making it more difficult for criminals to sell stolen metal, the government hopes to reduce the incentive for theft and keep communities safer. The new regulations have been welcomed by many in the scrap metal industry, who believe that they will help to clean up the sector and improve its reputation. However, some have expressed concerns about the bureaucracy and cost of the registration process. Despite these concerns, the vast majority of scrap dealers and motor salvage operators have complied with the new rules. They recognise that the regulations are necessary to protect their businesses from being tarnished by the activities of a few unscrupulous dealers and to help maintain a level playing field in the industry. In conclusion, the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 marks a significant step forward in the fight against metal theft in England and Wales. By requiring scrap dealers and motor salvage operators to register and keep detailed records, the legislation is making it much harder for criminals to sell stolen metal. This, in turn, is reducing the incentive for theft and helping to keep communities safer.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Hospices call for fundraising to continue,"Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice in Dinnington, South Yorkshire, has started a #LetsPledge campaign to keep people motivated and engaged during these challenging times caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This initiative comes after Sheffield Mayor Dan Jarvis visited the hospice and was moved by the continued efforts of the staff to support children and families in need. The hospice, which provides vital care and support to children with life-shortening conditions and their families, has seen a significant drop in fundraising events due to the ongoing crisis. With social distancing measures in place and large gatherings restricted, traditional fundraising methods have been put on hold. However, the team at Bluebell Wood remains determined to continue their essential work and is urging people to get involved in the #LetsPledge campaign. The campaign encourages individuals to commit to regular donations, no matter how small, to help ensure the hospice can continue to provide its services. Mayor Jarvis, who was appointed as a patron of Bluebell Wood in 2019, praised the team's resilience and the vital role they play in the community.

Sixth forms in England given Â£91m cash injection,"By Katherine Sellgren, BBC News education reporter The UK government's sixth forms in England are set to receive a significant cash boost, with Â£91m earmarked for various improvements and expansion projects. The funding injection, which was announced as part of the budget statement, includes Â£57.4m specifically for sixth form colleges to address their building needs. This comes as a welcome relief for many colleges, which have been grappling with outdated facilities and maintenance issues for years. Some colleges have reported having to resort to using portable classrooms as temporary solutions, while others have had to cancel subjects or limit the number of students due to space constraints. The new funding will enable these institutions to invest in much-needed upgrades, such as modern classrooms, laboratories, and facilities for students with special educational needs. In addition to the building funds, Â£30m has been allocated for school and college places for 16 to 19-year-olds. This will help to ensure that there are enough places for all students who want to continue their education after completing their GCSEs. This is particularly important in areas where there has been a surge in demand for post-16 places due to the government's drive to increase the participation rate in further education. A further Â£3.9m maintenance grant will also be given to help colleges and schools maintain their existing facilities, ensuring that they remain in good condition for students. The funding boost is likely to be welcomed by students, teachers, and parents, who have long argued that sixth forms in England have been underserved compared to their counterparts in other parts of the UK. The additional resources will enable colleges to offer a wider range of courses and better facilities, making them more attractive to students and helping to improve educational outcomes. However, some have raised concerns that the funding may not be distributed evenly, with some areas receiving more money than others. The government has not yet announced how the funds will be allocated, but it has pledged to work with local authorities and educational institutions to ensure that the money reaches those who need it most. Despite these concerns, the announcement of the funding injection is a positive step towards addressing the long-term issues facing sixth forms in England. With the right investment and support, these institutions can provide the high-quality education that students deserve and help to ensure that they are well-prepared for the next stage of their lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Wilson Jerman: Ex-White House butler dies with coronavirus,"It was Jackie Kennedy who noticed Wilson Roosevelt Jerman while he was working as a cleaner in the White House. The then First Lady had a keen eye for detail and appreciated the quiet dignity with which Jerman went about his duties. Over the next few years, she came to know him well, recognizing in him a kind and gentle soul. Jerman, who had started working at the White House in 1952, had become an integral part of the Kennedy administration. He was not just a butler or a cleaner; he was a confidant, a caretaker, and a friend to the First Family. He was there when President John F. Kennedy was sworn in, and he was there when the family mourned the loss of their youngest child, Patrick, who died at the age of two. Jerman's dedication to his work was unwavering. He took pride in ensuring that the Kennedy family's living quarters were immaculate, and he went the extra mile to make their lives as comfortable as possible. He was known to make the President's favorite milkshakes and to always have a hot water bottle ready for Jacqueline Kennedy when she was feeling under the weather. But even as he continued to serve the Kennedy family with devotion, Jerman's own life was far from easy. He had been born into poverty in Virginia and had left home at a young age to work as a farm laborer. He had joined the army during World War II and had served in Europe before coming to work at the White House. Despite the hardships he had faced, Jerman remained a humble and kind-hearted man. He was a devoted husband and father, and he took great pride in his relationship with the Kennedy family. In turn, they regarded him as a cherished member of their inner circle. However, in the twilight of his life, Jerman faced a new and unexpected challenge. He contracted the coronavirus and was hospitalized. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, Jerman's condition continued to deteriorate. On May 1, 2020, he passed away, leaving behind a legacy of quiet dignity and unwavering dedication. The news of Jerman's death was met with sadness and shock by those who knew him. President Kennedy had once said that Jerman was ""the best butler in the world."" Jacqueline Kennedy, who had remained in touch with Jerman after her husband's presidency, issued a statement expressing her condolences and remembering him as a ""dear friend."" Jerman's passing was a reminder of the quiet heroes who have served behind the scenes of history, providing essential support and care to those in power. It was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of adversity.

North Korean man caught by South after crossing border,"The man, in his 20s, was wearing an unusual ensemble as he was stopped by South Korean soldiers in the de-militarized zone (DMZ) along the border with North Korea. The soldiers were taken aback by his appearance: he was clad in a full diving suit, complete with a mask and a pair of fins strapped to his feet. South Korean authorities identified the man and revealed that he hailed from the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. They stated that he had crossed the heavily fortified border illegally and had been apprehended in the early hours of the morning. The man's motives for crossing the border were unclear, but South Korean officials suggested that he might have been seeking to defect to the South. Defectors from North Korea often make the perilous journey south, risking their lives to escape the repressive regime and seek a better life in the more affluent South. However, the man's decision to cross the border in a diving suit raised questions. South Korean officials speculated that he might have been attempting to evade detection by North Korean or South Korean guards, as the DMZ is heavily patrolled on both sides. The suit and fins could have provided him with the means to navigate the waterways that crisscross the DMZ undetected. The man's capture came at a sensitive time in inter-Korean relations. Tensions between the two Koreas have been high in recent months, with North Korea conducting a series of missile tests and threatening military action against the South. The capture of the man in the diving suit could be seen as an embarrassment for North Korea, particularly if he is found to be a defector. South Korean authorities were taking the man's case seriously, and he was being questioned by intelligence officers to determine the circumstances of his defection and any information he might have about North Korea. The man's unusual method of crossing the border was also being investigated, as South Korean officials sought to determine whether he had any accomplices or if there were any larger security concerns related to his escape. The capture of the North Korean man in the diving suit served as a reminder of the ongoing tensions and dangers along the Korean Peninsula border. Despite the efforts of both the South and the international community to promote peace and dialogue, the risk of conflict and the lure of a better life in the South continue to drive people to make dangerous journeys across the border.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Colombia offers reward after eight young partygoers killed,"Four gunmen, their faces concealed by masks, burst into a vibrant and lively party held at a private residence in Samaniego, a small town located in the Colombian department of Antioquia, on Saturday night. The unsuspecting guests, mostly young people in their twenties, were enjoying the evening, the sounds of laughter and music filling the air. Suddenly, the festivities were interrupted by the intrusion of the masked men, who entered the house through an open gate. Witnesses reported that the gunmen opened fire indiscriminately, targeting the young partygoers without warning. In the chaos that followed, seven men and one woman were killed, their lives senselessly taken in a violent and brutal act. The victims were part of a group of friends who had gathered at the house to celebrate. They had spent the afternoon preparing for the party, decorating the house and cooking delicious meals. Their families and loved ones had expected them to return home safe and sound after the festivities. But on this fateful night, their lives were tragically cut short. The killings have left the local community in shock and grief, with many residents struggling to come to terms with the senseless violence that has taken place in their midst. The authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, and have offered a reward of up to 150 million Colombian pesos (approximately $43,000 USD) for information leading to the identification and capture of the perpetrators. The police have appealed to the public for any information they might have about the gunmen or the motive behind the killings. The town of Samaniego has a population of around 10,000 people and is known for its peaceful and close-knit community. The killing of the eight young partygoers has rocked the town to its core, with many residents expressing their condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims. Local politicians and community leaders have condemned the violence and called for unity in the face of the tragedy. They have also urged the authorities to take swift and decisive action to bring the perpetrators to justice. In the wake of the killings, the local community has come together to support each other and to demand an end to the violence that has plagued the region for too long. They have organized vigils and marches to honor the memories of the victims and to call for peace and security in their town. As the investigation into the killings continues, the families and friends of the victims are left to mourn their loss and to seek answers.

Covid: Cardiff police given random vehicle check powers,"South Wales Police said it would increase the numbers of officers on duty in Cardiff this weekend to encourage people to adhere to the Covid-19 regulations. The force announced that they would be given random check powers to vehicles entering and exiting the city. The powers, which will be in place from 09:00 on Friday until 17:00 on Sunday, enable police to stop and question drivers about their reasons for travel and to check if they are complying with the current regulations. The measures are intended to prevent non-essential travel and reduce the spread of the virus in the area. People are urged to only make essential journeys during this period. The regulations state that people should only leave their homes for specific reasons such as work, education, exercise, or to provide care for a vulnerable person. The announcement comes as Wales enters Alert Level 4 of its Covid-19 response, which includes stricter measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Under the new restrictions, non-essential retail will close, and people will be required to work from home where possible. South Wales Police Superintendent Andy Morgan said, ""Our officers will be out in force over the coming days to ensure that people are adhering to the regulations. I would urge everyone to think carefully about their reasons for travel and only make essential journeys. We all have a responsibility to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from this virus."" The move has been welcomed by local authorities and community leaders, who have expressed concern about the number of people continuing to travel unnecessarily during the pandemic. Cardiff Council Leader Huw Thomas said, ""We all have a role to play in reducing the spread of the virus and protecting the health of our communities. I would urge everyone to follow the regulations and only make essential journeys. By working together, we can help keep each other safe."" The Welsh Government has also urged people to take personal responsibility for their actions and to follow the regulations to prevent the spread of the virus. First Minister Mark Drakeford said, ""The situation in Wales remains serious, and we all need to do our bit to help reduce the spread of the virus. By following the regulations and only making essential journeys, we can help protect ourselves, our families, and our communities."" The new powers come after similar measures were introduced in other parts of the UK, including London and Manchester.

Gaia Pope: Missing teenager murder suspects released,"Gaia, a 19-year-old young woman from Langton Matravers in Dorset, went missing from the seaside town of Swanage on 7 November. Her disappearance sent shockwaves through the community, with friends and family desperately seeking answers. The last known sighting of Gaia was near her accommodation, and as the days passed, the search for her grew more urgent. Local police launched a full-scale investigation, appealing for information and scouring the area for any clues. The public responded with an outpouring of support, sharing posts on social media and joining search parties. But as the days turned into weeks, hope began to fade. Then, on a crisp winter morning, police made two arrests in Swanage. Rosemary Dinch, a 71-year-old local resident, and her grandson, Nathan Elsey, 19, were taken into custody. The pair knew Gaia, having met her through mutual friends. The police confirmed that they had been arrested on suspicion of her murder. The news came as a shock to the community. Dinch, a respected member of the local community, and her grandson, a popular figure among the young people of Swanage, were well-known and well-liked. The idea that they could be involved in such a heinous crime was hard to comprehend. As the investigation continued, more details began to emerge. It appeared that Gaia had been last seen in the company of Elsey, and that she had been in contact with him in the days leading up to her disappearance. The exact circumstances of her death were still unclear, but the evidence against the pair was mounting. The community was left reeling from the news. People gathered in the town square, holding vigils and laying flowers in memory of Gaia. Local businesses offered to display missing person posters, and a crowdfunding campaign was launched to support her family. The investigation into Gaia's death continued, with the police working tirelessly to build a case against Dinch and Elsey. The community rallied around them, offering support and reassurance as they came to terms with the shocking turn of events. Throughout it all, Gaia's family remained strong, determined to bring justice for their beloved daughter and sister. They released a statement, expressing their gratitude for the support they had received and their hope that the truth would come to light. The case of Gaia's disappearance and subsequent murder was a tragic reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of community support in times of need.

US nuclear fears block Intel China supercomputer update,"Intel applied for a license to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, located in China's National Laboratory for High-Performance Computing in Tianjin. The Department of Commerce in the United States refused the export license, citing concerns about the potential use of the advanced technology in nuclear research. The Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which currently holds the title of the world's fastest, is used for a range of scientific research, including meteorology, materials science, and computational fluid dynamics. However, its capabilities also make it an attractive tool for nuclear research, particularly in the areas of weapons design and simulation. Intel's application for the export license was first reported by Reuters in late October, and the denial of the license was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Department of Commerce. In a statement, the spokesperson said, ""The United States is committed to preventing the export of items that could contribute to the development of weapons of mass destruction."" Separately, Intel has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to collaborate on research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The MOU was signed during a visit to China by Intel CEO Bob Swan, and was described by Swan as ""an important step forward in our long-term relationship with China."" The denial of the export license has raised concerns about the impact on the relationship between the US and China in the technology sector. China has been investing heavily in supercomputing technology, and the Tianhe-2 is just one of several advanced systems being developed in the country. The US has previously imposed export restrictions on other technology companies, including chipmaker Qualcomm and telecommunications equipment maker ZTE, citing national security concerns. The Trump administration has also taken a tough stance on China's intellectual property practices and its efforts to acquire technology from US companies. Intel has not commented on the impact of the export license denial on its collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences or its broader business relationship with China. However, the company has previously expressed its commitment to working with Chinese partners to develop AI technologies and other advanced technologies. The denial of the export license is a reminder of the complex geopolitical dynamics at play in the technology sector, as well as the potential for technology to be used for both peaceful and military purposes. It also highlights the challenges facing companies operating in the US-China technology relationship, as they seek to balance their business interests with the geopolitical realities of the world's two largest economies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
GP recruitment drive film 'tackles outdated stereotypes',"By Jane Dreaper, Health correspondent, BBC News It has been launched by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), which claims at least 10,000 extra GPs are needed to meet the demands of an ageing population and increasing patient numbers. The film, titled ""GPs: Beyond the Stereotype,"" aims to challenge outdated perceptions of general practice and encourage more medical students to consider a career in the field. The RCGP's bold recruitment drive comes as the health service faces a significant workforce shortage, with GP numbers having fallen by over 1,000 in the last decade. The college hopes that the film will help to debunk common myths about general practice, such as the belief that it is less prestigious than specialties like cardiology or surgery. The film features interviews with current GPs, who describe the rewards and challenges of their roles, and highlights the breadth and depth of general practice, from complex consultations and long-term patient care to community engagement and leadership opportunities. One GP interviewed in the film, Dr. Sarah Patel, shares her experiences of working in a diverse inner-city practice and the satisfaction she derives from making a real difference in her patients' lives. Another, Dr. Tom Evans, talks about the excitement of constantly learning new things and the fulfillment of being a generalist in an increasingly specialized world. The RCGP also hopes that the film will help to address the gender imbalance in the profession, where women make up just over half of the workforce but are underrepresented in leadership roles. The film features interviews with female GPs who discuss the challenges they have faced in their careers and their hopes for a more inclusive and supportive future. The college's president, Professor Martin Marshall, emphasizes that the film is just one part of a wider strategy to attract and retain more GPs. This includes measures such as flexible working arrangements, improved working conditions, and targeted recruitment campaigns in areas where GP numbers are particularly low. Marshall also acknowledges that the college cannot do it alone and calls on the government, medical schools, and other stakeholders to join the effort to address the GP workforce crisis. He argues that a more sustainable and balanced health workforce is essential for the long-term health and wellbeing of the population. The film, ""GPs: Beyond the Stereotype,"" is now available to watch online, and the RCGP plans to use it as a resource for medical students, schools, and other organizations to help challenge stereotypes and inspire the next generation of GPs.

"Libor trial: 'Ringmaster' was 'greedy', court hears","Former City trader Tom Hayes, 35, of Fleet in Hampshire, has been accused of acting in a ""thoroughly dishonest and manipulative manner"" during the trial at Southwark Crown Court on Monday. Prosecutors allege that Hayes conspired with other traders to manipulate the Libor rate, a benchmark interest rate used to price financial instruments worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The court heard evidence from Andrew Obasanjo, a former UBS trader who testified that he and Hayes discussed manipulating the yen Libor rate on numerous occasions between 2006 and 2010. Obasanjo claimed that Hayes suggested they should contact other traders to coordinate their trades in order to influence the rate. ""Tom would often suggest we call other banks to discuss what they were going to submit for Libor, and then we would use that information to decide what we would submit,"" Obasanjo testified. The prosecution also presented evidence from emails between Hayes and other traders, in which they discussed the possibility of manipulating the rate. In one email from 2008, Hayes wrote: ""Another 3bp [basis points] up in 3m Libor would be nice. Anything we can do?"" Defence lawyers for Hayes have argued that the trader was simply trying to make profitable trades and was not engaged in any illegal activity. They have also pointed out that other traders and banks were also involved in the alleged manipulation of the Libor rate. However, the court heard evidence from a witness who claimed that Hayes boasted about his involvement in manipulating the rate. The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, testified that he had dinner with Hayes in 2009 and that Hayes had told him: ""I can move the Libor rate whenever I want."" The jury was also shown a recording of a conversation between Hayes and another trader in which they discussed a plan to manipulate the Swiss Franc Libor rate. The conversation took place in August 2008, during the financial crisis, and the traders discussed the possibility of submitting falsely low rates to help their bank make a profit on certain trades. The trial continues, with the jury expected to hear evidence from more witnesses in the coming days. Hayes denies all charges against him. The Libor scandal, which came to light in 2012, has resulted in numerous investigations and regulatory actions against banks and traders involved in the manipulation of the benchmark rate. It has also led to significant fines and settlements for the banks involved, with UBS, Barclays, and Rabobank among those paying large sums to regulators and customers.

Autism brain secrets revealed by scan,"Scans revealed that children carrying a specific gene variant associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibited unique neural connectivity patterns within the frontal lobe of their brains. More precisely, these children had a higher number of nerve cell connections, or synapses, in certain areas of the frontal lobe. Conversely, they displayed a lower number of synapses in other regions. These findings, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that ASD is not a homogeneous condition but rather a spectrum of distinct neurobiological profiles. The study, led by Dr. Marc Haesler from the University of California, San Francisco, used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the brains of 57 children diagnosed with ASD and 65 typically developing children. The researchers focused on a particular gene variant, called 16p11.2, which is one of the most commonly identified genetic alterations in individuals with ASD. This variant is thought to affect the development and function of neurons in the brain, resulting in impairments in social communication and repetitive behaviors. The team's analysis revealed that children with the 16p11.2 gene variant showed increased connectivity between the frontal pole and the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region involved in decision-making and cognitive control. This heightened connectivity might explain some of the cognitive strengths observed in some individuals with ASD, such as superior memory, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities. However, the study also uncovered a reduction in connectivity between the ventral anterior cingulate cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus, a region involved in language and response inhibition. This deficit could contribute to the language and social communication difficulties that are hallmarks of ASD. Furthermore, the researchers found that the degree of alterations in neural connectivity was not uniform across all individuals with the 16p11.2 gene variant. Instead, the findings suggested that there might be subgroups of children with distinct neurobiological profiles, which could have important implications for personalized treatment approaches. ""This study demonstrates the importance of considering the individual differences within the autism population,"" said Dr. Haesler. ""By understanding the diverse neurobiological underpinnings of autism, we can develop targeted interventions to help each child reach their full potential."" These findings underscore the intricacy and complexity of the autistic brain and the need for further research to unravel the secrets hidden within. Ultimately, such insights could pave the way for more effective diagnostic tools and personalized interventions for children with ASD, shedding new light on the condition and providing valuable support for families and individuals affected by it.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Domestic violence legal aid changes were 'invalid',"Rights of Women, a leading charity that supports women affected by domestic violence, has raised serious concerns over recent changes to legal aid eligibility in England and Wales. The organization argued that victims have been unlawfully denied funding in civil court cases due to reforms instigated by the former Lord Chanceller, Chris Grayling. A rule that came into effect in 2013, known as the ""domestic violence gateway,"" was specifically contested. This change required individuals seeking legal aid to provide evidence of recent harm or risk of harm before they could access it. In theory, this measure aimed to prevent misuse of the legal aid system. However, in practice, it has left many victims of domestic violence without the crucial support they need. The charity's legal team, led by policy and legal officer, Chai Doshi-Vela, has taken the government to the High Court to challenge the rule. They argue that it is both unlawful and incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The case, brought on behalf of several women, is centered around the idea that the rule effectively forces victims to endure further harm to secure legal aid. Ms. Doshi-Vela explained, ""The domestic violence gateway is a significant barrier to justice for survivors who are unable to provide evidence of recent violence or risk of harm due to the covert nature of domestic abuse or fear of reprisals from their abusers."" The charity's concern is shared by several high-profile organizations, including Amnesty International, Refuge, and the Women's Aid Federation of England. They argue that the rule denies victims access to crucial support, leaving them at risk of further harm and abuse. The government, however, has defended the rule, stating that it ensures legal aid is used only by those who truly need it. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said, ""The legal aid system is designed to ensure that funding is only provided to those who genuinely need it, and we have robust safeguards in place to protect vulnerable people."" However, the charity argues that these safeguards are not enough. They claim that the rule effectively leaves victims of domestic violence in a ""Catch-22"" situation where they must face their abusers to secure the support they need. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for victims of domestic violence in England and Wales. If the High Court rules in favor of the charity, it could lead to a change in the rule and make it easier for victims to access crucial legal aid. If, however, the government's position is upheld, it could mean that many more victims are left without the support they need to leave abusive relationships. In the meantime, Rights of Women continues to campaign for better support for victims of domestic violence and to challenge the rule they see as a significant hindrance to justice.

Vietnam War: French court to hear landmark Agent Orange case,"The case was brought by Tran To Nga, a 78-year-old French-Vietnamese woman who covered the Vietnam War as a journalist. She accuses the chemical firms, including Dow Chemical and Monsanto, of causing harm to her and her children as a result of their production and use of Agent Orange during the conflict. Agent Orange was a herbicide used by the US military from 1961 to 1971 to defoliate forests and destroy crops in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The chemical mixture contained dioxin, a highly toxic substance that has been linked to various health problems, including birth defects, cancer, and neurological damage. Nga, who was born in Vietnam but moved to France in 1975, believes that her exposure to Agent Orange during her time as a journalist, as well as her children's exposure through contaminated soil and water, has resulted in serious health issues. She is seeking damages for her own injuries and those of her children. The case, which is set to begin in a Paris court on October 18, 2023, is considered a landmark in the ongoing efforts to hold the chemical firms accountable for the harm caused by Agent Orange. It comes after a similar case in 2018, where a Vietnamese plaintiff, Nguyen Thi Dieu, won a symbolic victory when a French court ruled that the companies had a ""moral responsibility"" to pay damages. However, no damages were awarded in that case, as the plaintiff had passed away before the ruling. This latest case, which involves multiple plaintiffs, including Nga and her children, could potentially lead to significant damages being awarded. The plaintiffs are seeking compensation for both material and moral damages, including medical expenses, lost income, and emotional distress. The defendants, Dow Chemical and Monsanto (which was acquired by Bayer in 2016), have denied any liability, arguing that they did not manufacture or sell Agent Orange in France and that they did not have any control over its use by the US military. However, the plaintiffs argue that the companies were aware of the potential health hazards of Agent Orange and failed to warn the public or take adequate measures to protect against exposure. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications, not only for the victims of Agent Orange in Vietnam but also for others around the world who have been affected by the use of toxic chemicals in conflicts and other situations. It could also set a precedent for future cases against chemical companies for their role in causing harm through the production and use of toxic substances. As the trial gets underway, Tran To Nga and other plaintiffs will have the opportunity to tell their stories and seek justice for the harm they have suffered. They will be joined by experts and witnesses who will testify about the health",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Homelessness Reduction Bill to become law,"The Homelessness Reduction Bill, which received royal assent on April 4, 2018, marks a significant shift in the UK's approach to tackling homelessness. The private member's bill, introduced by Conservative MP Bob Blackman, will require councils to take a more proactive and preventative role in helping vulnerable individuals before they find themselves on the streets. Under the new legislation, councils will be obligated to assess every person at risk of becoming homeless, regardless of whether they are eligible for assistance under the current laws. This expansion of support will help to identify and assist those who may not have previously been identified, such as young people leaving care or those experiencing domestic abuse. The Homelessness Reduction Bill also introduces a duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to all individuals at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a statutory right to assistance. This duty will require councils to offer tailored support to help individuals find and maintain suitable accommodation, as well as assistance with education, employment, and access to healthcare. The bill's preventative measures are designed to address the root causes of homelessness, rather than simply providing emergency accommodation. The government has committed Â£500 million to the rough sleeping strategy, with a focus on early intervention and prevention. The funding will be used to provide additional housing and support for homeless individuals, as well as initiatives to prevent homelessness in the first place. The Homelessness Reduction Bill is also expected to have a positive impact on the mental and physical health of homeless individuals. Research shows that homelessness can lead to increased rates of mental and physical health issues, as well as social exclusion and isolation. By providing early intervention and support, the bill aims to improve the lives of those at risk of becoming homeless and help them to rebuild their lives. The new legislation has been welcomed by homelessness charities and campaigners, who have long called for a more preventative approach to tackling homelessness. The rough sleeping strategy, which was published in September 2017, set an ambitious target of ending rough sleeping by 2027. The Homelessness Reduction Bill is a crucial step towards achieving this goal, and will help to ensure that vulnerable individuals receive the support they need to get off the streets and rebuild their lives. However, some have expressed concerns that the funding allocated to the rough sleeping strategy may not be enough to effectively implement the Homelessness Reduction Bill and other preventative measures. The government has promised to review the funding in the coming years to ensure that it is sufficient to meet the needs of those at risk of homelessness. Despite these challenges, the Homelessness Reduction Bill represents a significant step forward in the UK's efforts to tackle homelessness. By taking a more preventative and proactive approach, the bill aims to help vulnerable individuals before they find themselves on the streets, and ultimately, to end rough sleeping in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Gentoo penguins are four species, not one","By Helen Briggs, BBC Environment correspondent According to new evidence, the birds we know as Gentoo penguins are not one homogenous species but rather a complex grouping of four distinct types. This revelation, which challenges long-held assumptions about the Antarctic penguin population, is based on a combination of physical and genetic data. Gentoo penguins have long been recognized by their distinctive blue-gray back feathers, white bellies, and orange-red bills and ear patches. But recent studies have shown that there are subtle variations within these populations that were previously overlooked. Counting the numbers of these distinct sub-groups is proving to be a complex task. Researchers from the University of Oxford and the British Antarctic Survey have spent years studying the penguins in the South Sandwich andSouth Orkney Islands. They have found that the birds' sizes and shapes vary subtly between different colonies, with some populations having longer beaks, taller stature, or darker plumage. Moreover, DNA analysis has revealed that the different populations are genetically distinct from one another, further supporting the idea that there are multiple species of Gentoo penguins. This discovery has important implications for conservation efforts, as it highlights the need to protect the genetic diversity of these populations. One of the most notable differences between the sub-groups is their habitat preferences. For instance, some Gentoo penguins live in rocky, mountainous areas, while others inhabit flat, sandy beaches. These habitat differences have likely driven the evolution of the distinct sub-populations. The researchers have proposed names for the new sub-species based on their geographical locations. One group, found on the South Sandwich Islands, would be called the South Sandwich Gentoo. Another, inhabiting the South Orkney Islands, would be known as the South Orkney Gentoo. The exact names and taxonomic classification of the other two sub-species are still under debate. This new understanding of Gentoo penguin biology has important implications for how we study and protect these birds. By recognizing the distinctiveness of these populations, researchers can better understand the unique challenges they face and the specific conservation actions needed to ensure their long-term survival. This discovery also highlights the importance of ongoing research and the need for a nuanced understanding of the natural world. As our technology and knowledge improve, it's essential that we continue to challenge our assumptions and expand our understanding of the intricacies of the natural world. In conclusion, the Gentoo penguin, long thought of as a single species, is now known to be a complex grouping of four distinct types. These sub-species differ subtly in shape, size, and genetics, and inhabit different areas of the Antarctic continent. This new understanding of Gentoo penguin biology has important implications for conservation efforts and undersco",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Sony to sell PC unit and cut jobs,"The company will also split its TV division into a separate subsidiary as part of its restructuring programme. The moves were announced as Sony forecast a net loss of 110bn yen ($1.08bn; Â£665m) for the current financial year. This is a significant turnaround for the Japanese electronics giant, which had previously reported profits of 632.6bn yen ($5.9bn; Â£3.8bn) in the same period the previous year. Sony's PC business has been struggling for some time, with declining sales in recent years due to increased competition from other tech companies. The decision to sell the unit comes as part of a broader effort by Sony to focus on its core businesses, which include gaming, music, and imaging. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of March 2023. The restructuring programme also includes plans to cut around 5,000 jobs, or around 3% of Sony's global workforce. The majority of the job cuts will be in the company's electronics products and solutions segment, which includes the PC business. Sony's gaming division, which includes the PlayStation brand, is expected to remain a key part of the company's business going forward. The division reported strong sales in the latest quarter, with revenue up 28.4% year-on-year. The success of the PlayStation 5 console, which was launched in November 2020, has been a bright spot for Sony during a challenging period for the electronics industry. The decision to split the TV division into a separate subsidiary is also part of Sony's efforts to streamline its operations and focus on its core businesses. The new subsidiary will be called Sony Electronics (TV & Video Products) Corporation and will be headed by current Sony Electronics president, Yoshihisa Ishida. The move is expected to allow the TV division to better respond to market trends and customer needs. Sony's restructuring programme is a response to the challenges facing the electronics industry, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has been hit by supply chain disruptions, increased competition, and changing consumer preferences. The decision to sell the PC business and cut jobs is a difficult one, but is necessary to help Sony weather these challenges and position itself for future growth. In a statement, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said: ""We will continue to make bold management decisions and take necessary measures to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of our business."" Sony's shares fell by around 8% in response to the news, reflecting investors' concerns about the challenges facing the electronics industry and the impact of the restructuring programme on the company's earnings.

Cambridgeshire plesiosaur 'sea monster' could be 'new species',"In the rich, alluvial soil of Must Farm quarry near Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, Oxford archaeologists made a discovery that would send ripples through the scientific community. Dr Carl Harrington and his team unearthed the remains of a 165 million-year-old reptile, a find that could rewrite the history books. With over 600 pieces of bone recovered, it was clear that they had uncovered a significant find. At first, the team believed they had stumbled upon the fossilised remains of a large marine reptile, possibly an Iguanodon or a Pliosaur. However, as they began the painstaking process of piecing together the bones, it became apparent that this was no ordinary discovery. The bones showed distinct features unlike any other known marine reptile. The limbs, for instance, were more elongated and gracile than those of a Pliosaur, while the skull was flatter and more streamlined than that of an Iguanodon. Furthermore, the vertebrae were more numerous, suggesting a longer body. Dr Harrington and his team were baffled. They consulted with experts in the field, but no one could identify the species with certainty. It was clear that they had uncovered a new species of marine reptile, one that had eluded scientists for millions of years. The excitement was palpable as the team began to piece together the puzzle of this enigmatic creature. They named it Mustelus plesiosaurus, in honour of the quarry where it was discovered and its similarities to the well-known Plesiosauria order. But what did this new species tell us about the world in which it lived? The discovery of Mustelus plesiosaurus shed new light on the Jurassic period and the diverse range of marine life that existed during that time. The elongated limbs and streamlined body suggested that this creature was an excellent swimmer, capable of navigating the oceans with ease. The flat skull and numerous vertebrae indicated a flexible neck, which might have been used to capture prey or defend against predators. The discovery of Mustelus plesiosaurus also raised questions about the evolutionary relationships between different marine reptile groups. Its elongated limbs and gracile body were more reminiscent of the elasmosaurids, a group of marine reptiles with long, snake-like bodies and paddle-like limbs. However, its skull and vertebrae were more similar to the plesiosaurids. As the team continued their research, they began to unravel the mysteries of this enigmatic creature. They discovered that Mustelus plesiosaurus had lived during the late Jurassic period, around 155 million years ago. It was",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Chris Christie rules himself out of White House race,"Mr. Christie held a news conference at the governor's office, where he told reporters: ""Now is not my time."" The Republican has long been speculated as a potential contender for the 2016 White House race, but he put an end to the rumors on Tuesday, stating that he would not be seeking the nomination. Christie, a former federal prosecutor and two-term governor of New Jersey, addressed the media with a somber expression, expressing his disappointment at not being able to run for president. ""I have always believed that public service is about putting the greater good above your own self-interest,"" he said. ""After much reflection and constant introspection, I have decided that a presidential campaign at this time is not my call to serve."" Despite his decision, Christie did not rule out a future run for the presidency. ""I will continue to serve as your governor with every ounce of energy I have,"" he assured the crowd. ""And who knows what the future holds?"" Christie's announcement came as a surprise to many in the political world, as he had been seen as a serious contender for the Republican nomination. In recent months, he had been traveling the country, courting donors and building a campaign team. However, his poll numbers had been lackluster, and he had struggled to gain traction in the crowded field of Republican candidates. Christie's decision to drop out of the race was met with a mixed reaction from political pundits and analysts. Some saw it as a wise move, given his lack of momentum and the strength of other candidates in the race. Others saw it as a missed opportunity for a talented politician with a strong record of accomplishments. Regardless of the reaction, there is no doubt that Christie's decision marks the end of an exciting chapter in his political career. He leaves the presidential race with his dignity and his reputation intact, and he will undoubtedly continue to be a force in American politics for years to come. As Christie wrapped up his announcement, he took a moment to thank his supporters and his family. ""I want to thank the people of New Jersey for giving me the opportunity to serve as their governor,"" he said. ""I also want to thank my family for their unwavering support and their love."" Christie's decision to bow out of the presidential race may be a disappointment for some, but it is a testament to his commitment to public service and his belief in putting the greater good above his own self-interest. As he moves forward, it will be interesting to see where his political career takes him next.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Gay marriage opposed by Welsh ministers David Jones and Stephen Crabb,"Prime Minister David Cameron's announcement in support of same-sex marriage has sparked opposition from within his own party, with Welsh ministers David Jones and Stephen Crabb voicing their disagreement. His fellow Conservative and Wales Office deputy Stephen Crabb has confirmed that he will also oppose the move. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Crabb expressed his concerns, stating, ""I've always taken the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, and I've always thought that was the traditional understanding of marriage."" He added, ""I know there are strong feelings on both sides of this debate, but I think it's important for us to keep a balanced approach."" Monmouth MP David Davies, another vocal critic of the proposed legislation, has been more forthright in his criticism. He has labeled the idea ""barking mad"" and has called for the Conservative Party to focus on other issues, such as the economy and immigration. In a statement, Mr Davies said, ""The Coalition Government has enough problems without embarking on this social engineering project."" The opposition from Conservative MPs is not unexpected, as the issue of same-sex marriage has long been a contentious one within the party. However, Mr Cameron has made it clear that he intends to push ahead with plans to introduce legislation, despite the criticism. In a speech to the Conservative Party conference in October, he said, ""We are a liberal, compassionate, and progressive party. And if we want to keep being that party, we have to be prepared to change with the times."" The Prime Minister's stance on same-sex marriage has been welcomed by many in the LGBT community and their supporters. However, it has also drawn criticism from some religious groups, who argue that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. The Catholic Church, in particular, has been vocal in its opposition, with the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, issuing a statement expressing his concerns. Despite the opposition, Mr Cameron remains committed to introducing the legislation, which is expected to be brought before Parliament in the coming months. The Prime Minister has also indicated that he is open to amendments that would provide protections for religious institutions that do not wish to perform same-sex marriages. The debate over same-sex marriage is likely to continue for some time, with both sides passionately advocating their views. However, it is clear that the issue is no longer a fringe concern but one that is at the heart of the political agenda. With the Prime Minister's backing, it seems likely that same-sex marriage will eventually become a reality in the UK. The question remains, however, how long it will take for all sides to come to an agreement on this contentious issue.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Mark Kennedy: 'No misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police',"The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) reported on Tuesday that there was no misconduct by Nottinghamshire Police in relation to the actions of undercover officer Mark Kennedy during his deployment in the region between 2003 and 2008. However, the IPCC noted significant concerns regarding how evidence from Kennedy and his covert operations was handled and recorded. The IPCC investigation, which lasted over a year, found that Nottinghamshire Police failed to effectively manage the intelligence gathered by Kennedy during his time undercover. His activities, which included infiltrating political groups and forming relationships with activists, were not properly documented or shared with other officers or departments, making it difficult to assess the full extent of Kennedy's actions and their impact on those he engaged with. In their report, the IPCC stated that ""there were no allegations of misconduct or criminality by Nottinghamshire Police officers in connection with the deployment of Mark Kennedy."" However, they did identify a number of issues, including a lack of clear guidance on the use of undercover officers, insufficient training for officers involved in managing covert intelligence, and inadequate recording and sharing of intelligence. The IPCC's findings come after a lengthy and high-profile campaign by women who had relationships with Kennedy while he was undercover. They have accused the police of deceit and emotional manipulation, and have called for a full investigation into the actions of Nottinghamshire Police and other forces involved in Kennedy's deployment. The IPCC's report does little to quell the ongoing controversy surrounding Kennedy's actions and the wider issue of undercover policing in the UK. The lack of proper recording and sharing of intelligence raises serious questions about the accountability and transparency of police forces when it comes to the use of undercover officers, and the impact of their actions on individuals and communities. The IPCC has called for Nottinghamshire Police to take steps to address the issues identified in their report, including improving record-keeping and sharing of intelligence, and providing training to officers involved in managing covert operations. The force has acknowledged the findings and has pledged to take action to address the concerns raised by the IPCC. However, for those who have been affected by Kennedy's actions, the report offers little solace. The IPCC's findings do not absolve Nottinghamshire Police of responsibility for the harm caused by Kennedy's deployment, and many continue to call for a full and independent public inquiry into undercover policing in the UK. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the actions of undercover officers like Mark Kennedy have far-reaching consequences, and it is essential that police forces are held to account for their actions and the impact they have on individuals and communities. The IPCC's report is a step in the right direction, but it is only the beginning of a much larger conversation about the role of undercover policing in democratic societies",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Middlesbrough Council children's services supervision continues,"Middlesbrough Council was praised for its response to a finding in January of ""serious and widespread failures"" in its children's services, but the road to recovery is a long one. The report, published by inspectors from Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission (CQC), detailed numerous concerns, including delays in responding to referrals, inadequate support for families, and a lack of proper supervision and oversight. The most alarming finding was that children were left in harmful situations for extended periods of time, putting their safety and wellbeing at risk. The council, which has been under the scrutiny of inspectors since 2018, has pledged to take immediate action to address the issues raised in the report. The local authority has announced a series of measures to improve children's services, including the recruitment of additional social workers, the implementation of new training programmes, and the establishment of a new leadership team. However, the road to improvement will not be an easy one. The report highlighted the need for a cultural shift within the organisation, with a renewed focus on putting children's needs at the heart of decision-making. The council has acknowledged that this will require a significant investment of time, resources, and political will. One of the key areas for improvement identified in the report was the supervision of social workers. Inspectors found that too often, social workers were not receiving the support and guidance they needed to make effective decisions and provide appropriate interventions for children in need. The council has announced plans to strengthen its supervision arrangements, including the recruitment of experienced social work managers and the development of a new training programme for supervisors. Another area of concern was the support available to families. The report found that some families were not receiving the help they needed to keep their children safe and healthy. The council has pledged to improve its early intervention services, including the provision of parenting programmes, family support workers, and other forms of preventative support. The council has also promised to engage more closely with children and young people, ensuring that their voices are heard and their needs are met. This includes the establishment of a children's panel, made up of young people from across the town, which will provide advice and feedback on services and policies. The challenges facing Middlesbrough Council's children's services are significant, but the council is determined to rise to the occasion. The road to recovery will be long and difficult, but with a renewed focus on putting children's needs at the heart of decision-making, and a commitment to improving supervision, support for families, and engagement with children and young people, Middlesbrough Council is taking the steps necessary to build a brighter future for its most vulnerable children.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tikrit: Iran key in fight to wrest city from IS,"By Nafiseh Kohnavard, BBC Persian, Beirut Shia militia sources in Iraq have confirmed that Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, is personally taking part in leading the operation to retake the city of Tikrit from Islamic State (IS) militants. Gen Soleimani's involvement in the battle comes as part of a wider Iranian role in the campaign to recapture Tikrit, which fell to IS in June 2014. The militant group's advance through northern and western Iraq marked the start of its territorial expansion in the country. Iranian military advisers have been supporting Iraqi forces for months, but Gen Soleimani's presence on the ground is a clear sign of Tehran's commitment to the battle. The operation to retake Tikrit was launched on 24 March, with Iraqi security forces and Shia militias advancing on the city from different directions. Iranian sources say that Gen Soleimani is coordinating the efforts of the various militias and Iraqi forces, and is also directly involved in the fighting. The IS presence in Tikrit has been a major challenge for Iraqi forces, who have faced fierce resistance from the militants. IS has used the city as a stronghold and has fortified its positions there. The battle for Tikrit is seen as a significant test for Iraqi forces, who have suffered heavy losses in previous battles against IS. The militants have also shown that they are capable of launching counter-attacks and regaining lost territory. The involvement of Iranian forces in the operation has raised concerns from some Sunni Arab leaders and Western powers, who fear that it could further fuel sectarian tensions in Iraq. The United States has criticised Iran's role in the campaign, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying that the US does not support ""external forces dictating the outcome of the fight against ISIL in Iraq"". Despite the international criticism, Iranian military advisers and Shia militias continue to play a crucial role in the fight against IS in Iraq. Iran's support for Iraqi forces is not limited to military assistance. Tehran has also provided humanitarian aid to displaced people in the region, and has called for a political solution to the crisis in Iraq. The battle for Tikrit is expected to be a long and difficult one, with both sides showing no signs of backing down. The outcome of the battle could have significant implications for the future of Iraq and the wider region.

In quotes: Reaction to US Libya deaths,"US President Barack Obama, speaking solemnly before reporters in the White House Rose Garden, strongly condemned the ""outrageous attack"" on the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, which took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Right now, the American people are grieving, and the world is watching, as the full scope of this tragic event becomes clear. The attack, which took place on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, brought back painful memories for many Americans and prompted renewed questions about security in the volatile region. ""The United States will work with the Libyan government to bring those responsible for these attacks to justice,"" Obama said, adding that the US would take ""all necessary steps"" to protect its citizens and diplomats. Reaction to the attack was swift and widespread, with leaders from around the world expressing their condolences and solidarity with the US. In a statement, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the attack ""deplorable"" and urged ""all parties to refrain from any violent or destructive acts."" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton also condemned the attack, calling it a ""senseless act of violence"" that ""undermines efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous Libya."" In Libya itself, the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi sparked protests against the US presence in the country. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the consulate, some calling for the expulsion of US diplomats and others expressing their anger over an anti-Islam film produced in the US that had sparked protests in other parts of the Muslim world. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in Washington, expressed her condolences to the families of the victims and pledged to bring those responsible for the attack to justice. She also defended the right of Americans to express their views, even if those views are offensive to some. ""We reject the attacks against American diplomatic missions, and we reject the attacks against the character of the American people,"" Clinton said. ""But let me be clear: we are not just protecting Americans. We're protecting the values that we share with people around the world. Values like freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to live in peace and security."" The attack in Benghazi was a tragic reminder of the complex and often dangerous realities of American diplomacy in a volatile part of the world. As the US and its allies work to bring those responsible for the attack to justice, they will also continue to seek ways to build peaceful and stable relationships with the people and governments of the Middle East and North Africa.

Pte Sean Benton: Sister hopes Army will learn from Deepcut inquest,"Pte Sean Benton, a young soldier of 20 years from Hastings, was found with five gunshot wounds to his chest at the Surrey army base in Deepcut, on September 19, 1995. His tragic death, which was ruled a suicide by the military authorities, has been the subject of much controversy and scrutiny for over two decades. As the inquest into Pte Benton's death reconvened on Monday, his sister, Tanya, spoke of her hope that the Army would learn from this case and other similar incidents that have occurred at Deepcut. Tanya, who was just 16 when her brother died, expressed her deep sadness and frustration, stating, ""Nothing has changed. We've had inquest after inquest. Nothing's been done."" The inquest, which is expected to last several weeks, will examine new evidence, including a recently discovered witness statement and documents about the Army's handling of the case. This includes allegations that Pte Benton had been bullied and harassed in the days leading up to his death, and that his gun was found with an unauthorized modification. The hearing comes after a report by the coroner in 2012 found that Pte Benton's death was an ""unlawful killing,"" and that the Army had failed to provide adequate care and support for the soldier. The report also criticized the way in which the investigation into his death was carried out, with evidence being lost or destroyed. Since then, several other soldiers have died at Deepcut, raising further concerns about the safety and well-being of recruits at the base. Tanya Benton is not alone in her call for change. Campaign groups, such as the Deepcut Parents' Campaign, have long been pushing for reforms in the army, including better mental health support and harsher penalties for bullying and harassment. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said it would continue to cooperate fully with the inquest and that it had taken significant steps to improve the welfare and well-being of its personnel. However, Tanya Benton remains unconvinced, stating, ""They still don't get it. They still don't understand what they've done to us and how they've destroyed our lives."" As the inquest continues, the spotlight will remain on the Army and its handling of the deaths at Deepcut. The hopes and expectations of many lie with the conclusion of this hearing and the prospect of change that it may bring. For the Benton family, and many others, it is a matter of justice, accountability, and making sure that no other family has to endure the same pain and suffering that they have.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Newquay man weeding his way around town,"Alex Russell, a resident of Newquay in Cornwall, found solace in an unlikely activity during the coronavirus lockdown - weeding. The 31-year-old man, who suffers from anxiety and depression, shared how this simple act brought him a sense of calm and purpose. ""I've always enjoyed being outside, but I've never really taken up gardening,"" Alex explained. ""But when the lockdown started, I felt like I had no control over anything. My mental health was suffering, and I needed something to focus on."" He began by weeding the small patch of land outside his flat. As the days passed, he found himself spending more and more time on the task, expanding his efforts to neighbouring properties and public spaces. ""At first, people looked at me a bit strangely,"" Alex admitted. ""But once they saw what I was doing, they started to help out. It became a community thing, and I felt like I was making a difference."" Alex's weeding project soon became a daily ritual. He woke up early each morning, put on his gardening gloves, and headed out to tackle the overgrown areas around town. As he worked, he noticed the positive impact it had on his mental health. ""Weeding is a mindful activity,"" he said. ""You have to focus on the task at hand, and you can see the immediate results of your labour. It's a great way to clear your mind and de-stress."" Alex's story has inspired others in his community to get involved. Neighbours have joined him in weeding their own gardens, and local businesses have offered him supplies and support. He's even received messages from people across the country, expressing their admiration for his project and asking for advice on starting their own. ""I never imagined that weeding would bring me so much joy and fulfillment,"" Alex said. ""But it's been a lifeline for me during these difficult times. I encourage anyone who's feeling anxious or uncertain to try it out for themselves."" As the lockdown restrictions begin to ease, Alex plans to continue his weeding project.

British Airways fined Â£20m over data breach,"The breach took place in 2018 and affected both personal and credit card data of approximately 500,000 British Airways customers. The fine imposed on the airline for this data breach is Â£20 million. This penalty, announced by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), comes after a thorough investigation into the incident. The ICO stated that the personal data of 258,000 customers were stolen in this cyber-attack, while the credit card details of an additional 227,000 individuals were compromised. The data was taken during a two-week period in 2018, during which hackers gained unauthorised access to the British Airways website. The ICO's investigation found that British Airways had failed to adequately protect the data of its customers. The airline did not have appropriate security measures in place to prevent this attack, despite knowing that there were vulnerabilities in its systems. The fine imposed on British Airways is considerably smaller than the Â£183 million penalty imposed on Google in 2019 for similar data breach violations. However, the ICO emphasised that the size of the fine does not reflect the severity of the breach or the harm caused to the affected individuals. British Airways has apologised for the incident and has stated that it has taken steps to improve its cybersecurity measures. The airline has also established a dedicated team to manage customer communications and support. The ICO's investigation highlighted the importance of companies taking data protection seriously. The ICO's Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, stated, ""The penalty for neglecting data security can be huge, not just in financial terms, but in the damage to a company's reputation."" British Airways is not the first airline to face such a penalty. In 2015, EasyJet was fined Â£100,000 for failing to protect customer data. In 2018, Jet2.com was also fined Â£100,000 for a data breach that affected around 2.5 million customers. The ICO's investigation into British Airways is ongoing, and further penalties may be imposed if more breaches are discovered. The airline has also been ordered to pay costs of Â£600,000 associated with the investigation. The data breach at British Airways serves as a reminder for all companies to prioritise data security and to take proactive steps to protect the personal data of their customers. With the increasing number and sophistication of cyber-attacks, it is more important than ever for companies to be vigilant and to invest in robust cybersecurity measures. In conclusion, the ICO's Â£20 million fine on British Airways for the 2018 data breach serves as",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Richard Desmond 'plans National Lottery bid',"The plans by Mr Desmond, who runs the Health Lottery, to mount a challenge to Camelot's monopoly on the UK National Lottery have been reported in the Financial Times, sending shockwaves through the gambling industry and raising intriguing questions about the future of the popular game. Since its inception in 1994, Camelot has held the exclusive franchise for operating the National Lottery in the UK, generating billions in revenue and becoming an integral part of the British cultural landscape. The company's success, however, has not gone unchallenged. Mr Desmond's Health Lottery, which was established in 2011 and operates in a number of regional lotteries, has been growing steadily and has already shown an ability to attract players with its unique selling proposition of supporting health causes. With the National Lottery franchise up for grabs when it expires later this year, Mr Desmond sees an opportunity to expand his business and potentially take on the market leader. A challenge to Camelot's monopoly would not be an easy feat. The National Lottery is a massive enterprise that requires significant investment in infrastructure, marketing, and technology. Camelot's scale and experience in the industry give it a distinct advantage, making it a formidable opponent for any new entrant. However, Mr Desmond is not one to shy away from a fight. He has already shown his ability to disrupt the market with his regional lotteries, which have proved popular with players who feel they have been overlooked by the National Lottery. His plans for the National Lottery bid are reportedly backed by a group of investors, giving him the financial muscle to take on Camelot. The potential implications of a new entrant in the market are significant. A two-horse race between Camelot and Mr Desmond could lead to increased competition, potentially benefiting consumers through better value and more diverse offerings. However, it could also lead to a fragmented market, making it harder for players to keep track of the various lottery games and their rules. The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, has yet to announce its decision on who will be awarded the National Lottery franchise. The competition is expected to be fierce, with both Camelot and Mr Desmond making strong cases for why they should be given the opportunity to run the lottery. Whatever the outcome, the race to secure the National Lottery franchise is set to be one of the most closely watched business stories of the year. With significant financial and reputational stakes at play, the battle between Camelot and Mr Desmond is sure to be a fascinating spectacle. In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy their favourite games, safe in the knowledge that the National Lottery will continue to operate as normal until a decision is made. Whether Mr Desmond's bid proves successful or not, one thing is certain: the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Scientists find 'better way' to grow adult stem cells,"Standard surfaces have proved limited for growing large amounts and retaining the stem cells' useful characteristics. It is hoped that a recent discovery by a team of international scientists may provide a solution to this long-standing challenge in the field of regenerative medicine. The researchers, led by Professor Yuhan Qi from the University of California, San Diego, have developed a new method for growing adult stem cells using a biomaterial that closely mimics the natural environment of the human body. This approach could potentially lead to more effective and efficient ways of generating large numbers of stem cells for therapeutic applications. Adult stem cells are unspecialized cells found in various tissues throughout the body. They have the remarkable ability to develop into different cell types, making them valuable tools for repairing damaged tissues and organs. However, growing large quantities of adult stem cells in a laboratory setting has been a significant challenge due to their sensitivity to their environment and the tendency to lose their useful characteristics when grown on traditional surfaces. To address this issue, the researchers turned to a biomaterial known as decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM). This substance is obtained by removing the cells from an organ or tissue, leaving behind the natural scaffolding of the ECM. By using this material as a surface for growing stem cells, the researchers were able to maintain the cells' stemness and differentiation potential. Furthermore, the decellularized ECM also provided the stem cells with the necessary cues for tissue development, including mechanical and biochemical signals. As a result, the stem cells grown on the ECM surface were more robust and showed improved differentiation into specific cell types compared to those grown on standard surfaces. The researchers also tested the efficacy of their new method by generating large numbers of stem cells from human cord blood. They found that that the decellularized ECM-grown stem cells were superior in terms of proliferation rate and differentiation potential compared to the standard surface-grown cells. This breakthrough could potentially pave the way for more effective and efficient stem cell therapies for various conditions, including injuries, degenerative diseases, and genetic disorders. The team is now planning to further investigate the potential applications of their new method, including the use of decellularized ECM from specific tissues to generate tissue-specific stem cells for regenerative medicine. In conclusion, the discovery of a new method for growing adult stem cells using decellularized extracellular matrix represents a significant step forward in the field of regenerative medicine. This approach could potentially lead to more effective and efficient ways of generating large numbers of stem cells while maintaining their useful characteristics, opening up new possibilities for stem cell therapies.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Prison day release rules to be tightened, minister says","In a move to enhance public safety and reduce the risk of reoffending, the Ministry of Justice announced plans to tighten the rules governing prison day release. Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, with prisoners only permitted out for a specific purpose, such as work experience or attending education or training courses. Day-release prisoners will also have to meet more stringent criteria before being granted permission to leave prison during the day. The changes come following a review of the scheme, which found that some offenders were being released inappropriately, posing a risk to the public. Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, said: ""Day release is an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate into society and prepare for release, but it is essential that we ensure public safety is our top priority. These new measures will ensure that only those who are deemed low risk and have a genuine reason for being released during the day are eligible for day release."" Under the new rules, prisoners will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with the Parole Board considering each application carefully. Prisoners will need to demonstrate that they pose a low risk to the public and have a clear plan in place for their time outside of prison. They will also be required to wear an electronic tag to monitor their movements and have regular contact with their probation officer. The new measures are expected to affect around 1,500 prisoners currently on day release. The changes are intended to make the scheme more effective in reducing reoffending and ensuring the safety of the public. The decision to tighten the rules on day release follows a similar move in November 2020, when the government announced that prisoners sentenced to life for murder would no longer be eligible for automatic release after serving 20 years. Instead, they will have to serve a whole life order, meaning they will only be considered for release if the Parole Board believes they no longer pose a risk to the public. The government is also considering further reforms to the parole system, including giving victims a greater say in the parole process and allowing victims to appeal against decisions to release offenders. The Justice Secretary has also called for more resources to be allocated to the probation service, to help ensure that offenders are given the support they need to reintegrate into society and reduce the risk of reoffending. The new day release rules are expected to come into effect later this year. The Ministry of Justice has stressed that the safety of the public will remain its top priority as it implements these reforms.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Historical child abuse support call by Simon Danczuk MP,"Simon Danczuk's comments come after it emerged South Wales Police are looking into claims former House of Commons speaker George Thomas, also known as Viscount Tonypandy, abused a child. Danczuk, a Labour MP and former Rochdale MP, has been a vocal campaigner against historical child abuse and has long called for a national inquiry into the issue. Speaking to BBC Wales, Danczuk expressed his disappointment and concern over the latest developments in the case. ""I'm deeply saddened to hear these allegations against George Thomas,"" he said. ""It's important that the police are taking this seriously and investigating these claims thoroughly. It's crucial that we remember that behind every allegation is a survivor of abuse, and it's important that they are given the support and belief they deserve."" Thomas, who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1979, has been under investigation by South Wales Police since last year. The alleged abuse is said to have taken place in the 1960s and 1970s in the Cardiff area. Danczuk has been a prominent figure in the fight against historical child abuse, following the revelations of widespread abuse in Rochdale in 2012. He wrote a book on the subject, ""Fearless: Standing Up to the Rochdale Abusers,"" and has been a vocal advocate for victims and survivors. ""It's important that we continue to shine a light on historical child abuse and support those who have been affected,"" Danczuk continued. ""We need to remember that this is not just about holding individuals to account, but about supporting survivors and ensuring that they are given the help they need to recover from the trauma they have experienced. It's also about making sure that we do everything we can to prevent such abuse from happening in the future."" Danczuk's comments come as the issue of historical child abuse continues to dominate headlines, with new cases and investigations emerging regularly. The Labour MP has called for a national inquiry into the issue, which he believes would help to uncover the truth and provide justice for survivors. ""We cannot allow historical child abuse to remain a taboo subject,"" Danczuk said. ""We need to continue to challenge the culture of silence and support those who have been affected. It's important that we remember that every survivor of abuse deserves to be believed and supported, and that we do everything we can to prevent such abuse from happening again."" As the investigation into Thomas continues, Danczuk has reiterated his call for a national inquiry into historical child abuse. ""We cannot afford to ignore the evidence any longer,"" he said. ""We need to take action, support survivors, and ensure that those responsible for historical child abuse are brought to justice.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cancer costing European Union countries 'billions',"The charity Cancer Research UK recently stated that cancer is a ""huge burden"" on the European Union (EU) countries, with the latest figures revealing the extent of this financial toll. The data, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet Oncology, provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of cancer in Europe. The report indicates that the total cost of cancer in the EU reached an estimated â¬157.3 billion (Â£138.8 billion) in 2018. This staggering figure represents a significant increase from the â¬123.5 billion (Â£109.6 billion) reported in 2010. This surge in costs can be attributed to several factors, including the rising number of cancer cases, the escalating costs of cancer treatments, and the substantial socio-economic consequences of the disease. The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care, as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care. Direct health care costs accounted for approximately 62% of the overall expenditure, with drug costs representing a substantial portion of these expenses. In 2018, the EU spent â¬94.5 billion (Â£83.5 billion) on cancer treatment and diagnosis, highlighting the significant financial resources dedicated to managing the disease. Moreover, the report highlighted the considerable economic burden of cancer on EU countries in terms of productivity losses. In 2018, an estimated â¬62.8 billion (Â£55.3 billion) was lost due to premature mortality and disability-adjusted life years. The socio-economic consequences of cancer were further exacerbated by the substantial indirect costs associated with caregiving and informal care. In 2018, these indirect costs amounted to â¬25.5 billion (Â£22.1 billion). The report emphasised the need for better prevention and early detection strategies to mitigate the economic burden of cancer. By focusing on reducing the incidence and mortality of cancer, EU countries could potentially save billions of euros in the long run. Furthermore, the report called for increased investment in cancer research and innovation to develop more effective and cost-efficient treatments. The economic burden of cancer in the EU underscores the urgent need for action to address this complex and multifaceted challenge. By working together to invest in research, improve prevention and early detection, and develop more effective and affordable treatments, EU countries can reduce the human and financial toll of cancer on their populations. In conclusion, the Lancet Oncology report serves as a stark reminder of the enormous economic burden of cancer in the European Union. With the total cost of cancer reaching â¬157.3 billion (Â£138.8 billion) in 2018, it is clear that tackling this disease requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders.

Losing GSP+ can be 'very negative',"The European Union (EU) issued a stern warning to Sri Lanka on Monday, stating that the country could potentially lose its special trading rights within the EU bloc due to a failure to improve its human rights record. This warning came after the completion of a year-long inquiry into Sri Lanka's progress on human rights and democratic reforms. The EU's statement was released following a meeting between the EU and Sri Lankan delegations in Brussels. During the meeting, the EU expressed its deep concern over the lack of progress in key areas, including accountability for past human rights abuses, freedom of expression, and the rule of law. The potential loss of the Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status would be a significant blow to Sri Lanka's economy. This status, which was granted to the country in 2017, offers duty-free access to the EU market for over 6,000 products. Losing this status would mean that Sri Lanka would have to pay tariffs on these exports, making them less competitive in the EU market. The impact of losing GSP+ would be felt most acutely by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka. These businesses make up the vast majority of Sri Lanka's exporters and would be hit hard by the loss of preferential access to the EU market. The EU is Sri Lanka's largest trading partner, accounting for over 40% of the country's total exports. The EU's warning comes as Sri Lanka faces mounting pressure from the international community to address its human rights issues. In recent months, there have been reports of escalating violence against religious minorities, as well as allegations of harassment and intimidation of journalists and human rights activists. The Sri Lankan government has responded to the EU's warning with a commitment to continue working on reforms. However, critics argue that the government's efforts have not been sufficient to address the root causes of the human rights issues. The potential loss of GSP+ status is not just a concern for Sri Lanka's economy; it also raises broader questions about the role of the international community in holding countries accountable for human rights abuses. The EU's warning serves as a reminder that there are consequences for failing to meet international standards on human rights and democratic reforms. As the situation develops, it remains to be seen whether Sri Lanka will be able to make the necessary reforms to keep its special trading status with the EU. However, one thing is clear: the potential loss of GSP+ would be a significant setback for Sri Lanka's economy and its efforts to integrate into the global trading system. In conclusion, the EU's warning to Sri Lanka about the potential loss of GSP+ status is a reminder of the importance of respecting human rights and democratic norms.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Man guilty of killing unborn baby by kicking mum's stomach,"Malorie Bantala, a 22-year-old expectant mother, was ambushed outside her Peckham home on the fateful day of 15 June. The attack, which came as a shock to her and her family, left her reeling in pain and shock. Accompanying Malorie was her unborn baby boy, who would unfortunately become the unwitting victim of a senseless act of violence. Kevin Wilson, also 22, and a teenager were the perpetrators of this heinous crime. Wilson, who had a history of violent behavior, had harbored a grudge against Malorie for reasons unknown. With a sinister intent, he and his accomplice converged upon her as she stepped out of her home, leaving her no chance to defend herself. As Malorie cried out in terror, Wilson delivered a series of powerful kicks to her abdomen. The force of the blows was enough to cause catastrophic damage to her unborn child. The impact of the kicks was felt not only by Malorie but also by the innocent life growing within her. The baby boy, who had been developing normally up until that point, was now fighting for his life. Malorie was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery to save her own life. She sustained life-threatening internal bleeding and a fractured hand as a result of the attack. However, the damage inflicted upon her unborn child was far more severe. The young boy, who had been due to be born just a few weeks later, was declared stillborn as a result of the violence inflicted upon his mother. The news of the attack sent shockwaves through the local community. Neighbors and friends were left devastated by the senseless act of violence, with many expressing their condolences to Malorie and her family. The police launched a manhunt for Wilson and his accomplice, and within hours, they were apprehended and charged with grievous bodily harm and the manslaughter of an unborn child. Malorie's attacker, Kevin Wilson, was remorseful for his actions, but the damage had already been done. He was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years for his crimes. The teenager, who had been a minor at the time of the attack, was also charged and sentenced to a term of youth detention. The tragedy of Malorie Bantala's attack serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the devastating consequences of violence. The loss of an unborn child is a grief that few can understand, and the impact of such an event can ripple through generations. As we continue to grapple with the aftermath of this senseless act, we are left to reflect upon the importance of empathy, understanding, and the value of every human life.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tenerife beheading: Murder suspect 'haunted by voices',"Bulganian national Deyan Deyanov, 29, stood before the Spanish court, his once vibrant eyes now hollow and haunted. His voice trembled as he spoke, admitting to the grisly crime that had shocked the quiet town of Tenerife. The sun-soaked Canary Islands paradise had been shattered by the brutal beheading of Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, a beloved local artist and grandmother. Deyanov, a former construction worker, confessed to the crime but claimed he was not in control of his actions. He told the court that he was plagued by voices that ""direct how I act."" The chilling admission left the courtroom in stunned silence. The Bulgarian man's troubled past was laid bare before the judges. He spoke of a life riddled with drug addiction, detailing his use of crack cocaine and LSD. Deyanov's descent into chaos was rapid, he explained, fueled by his inner demons and fueled further by his addiction. The court also heard testimony from local residents, recounting strange encounters with Deyanov leading up to the murder. One witness described an eerie encounter with the suspect, who had stared at her intensely before muttering incoherently to himself. Another spoke of finding Deyanov in a state of frenzy, rambling about voices commanding him to do unimaginable things. As the trial continued, the tragic life of Jennifer Mills-Westley began to emerge. Her friends and family painted a touching picture of a kind and compassionate woman, whose vibrant artwork brought joy to the community. Her brutal death had left them shattered, and the community in mourning. Meanwhile, the defense team argued that Deyanov was the victim of mental illness, not a cold-blooded murderer. They cited his confession of being haunted by voices as evidence of his fragile mental state. But the prosecution was quick to counter, pointing to the premeditated nature of the crime and the brutal manner in which it was carried out. As the trial came to a close, the court was left to ponder the tragic tale of two lives - one cut short by violence, and another consumed by madness. The fate of Deyan Deyanov now rested in the hands of the judges, as they deliberated on his guilt or innocence. Regardless of their decision, the chilling confession of a man ""haunted by voices"" would leave a lasting scar on the peaceful town of Tenerife.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Tata Steel: Pension fund deficit deters buyers, says Javid","Tata Steel's significant pension fund deficit continues to act as a deterrent for potential buyers of the UK business, according to the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid. Speaking before the Business Select Committee, Javid acknowledged the concerns of interested parties regarding the pension scheme, which has over 130,000 members and a deficit of Â£485m. Javid stated, ""It's not unreasonable for potential buyers to say, 'look we're interested in the assets, but we're concerned about the pension fund and its deficit.' It is a material issue."" The Business Secretary's comments come amid ongoing speculation about the potential sale of Tata Steel's UK operations. The pension fund deficit, which represents the shortfall between the scheme's liabilities and its assets, has been a major point of contention in previous attempts to sell the business. In 2016, Tata Steel narrowly avoided insolvency due in part to a government-backed bailout, which included a commitment to inject Â£500m into the pension fund. Javid reiterated the government's stance on the pension fund during the hearing, stating, ""We made it clear that any potential buyer would have to accept the pension liabilities and find a way to manage those going forward."" He also emphasized the importance of maintaining a viable steel industry in the UK, stating, ""We're not just talking about a pension fund here, we're talking about an industry that employs thousands of people and is strategically important."" The pension fund deficit is just one of the challenges facing Tata Steel in the UK. The company has faced intense competition from lower-cost producers in Asia and Europe, as well as the high cost of energy and raw materials in the UK. Despite these challenges, Javid remains optimistic about the future of Tata Steel in the UK, stating, ""There are a lot of interested parties out there. We're confident that a solution can be found that's good for the pension fund, good for the workforce, and good for the long-term future of the industry."" However, the pension fund deficit remains a significant obstacle to any potential sale, and it is unclear how a buyer would manage the liability going forward. Some industry experts have suggested that the pension fund could be transferred to the Pension Protection Fund, a government-backed scheme that provides compensation to members of underfunded pension schemes. Javid acknowledged the complexity of the situation, stating, ""This is not a simple issue. It requires careful consideration and a long-term solution. But we're determined to find a way forward that's good for all parties involved."" As the search for a buyer continues, Tata Steel and the UK government face a challenging road ahead in addressing the pension fund deficit and securing a viable future for the steel industry in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Wales weather: M4 clear after Storm Frank flooding,"Following the passing of Storm Frank, the M4 motorway in Wales saw clearer conditions on Tuesday, allowing traffic to flow more smoothly. However, the aftermath of the heavy rain and flooding incidents left remnants of damage and disruption. Police dealt with three separate crashes where there was standing water on both sides of the carriageway between junctions 35 (Pencoed) and 36 (Sarn). Flooding also blocked one lane, causing long tailbacks and delays for motorists. Emergency services worked diligently to clear the incidents, but advisories remained in place for drivers to exercise caution when approaching the areas. The stormy weather brought chaos to the region, with many other areas experiencing inundation as well. The flooding was particularly severe in the Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend regions, where emergency services were called to dozens of incidents. In some areas, residents had to be rescued from their homes as rising water levels threatened their safety. Despite the challenges, the response from emergency services, local authorities, and the community at large was commendable. Volunteers from the local community joined forces with emergency services to help sandbag affected properties, provide temporary shelter, and offer support to those in need. Transport for Wales, the national rail operator, also faced significant disruption due to the heavy rain and flooding. Several lines were closed, causing delays and cancellations to trains. Passengers were advised to check their journeys before traveling and to avoid unnecessary travel if possible. Storm Frank brought an end to a period of dry weather and left many in Wales with a renewed appreciation for the importance of being prepared for extreme weather conditions. With the winter months still ahead, authorities are urging residents to take steps to protect their homes and property, including signing up for flood warnings, creating flood plans, and building flood resilience measures. As the sun began to make an appearance, the M4 motorway started to see a return to normal traffic conditions. However, the aftermath of the storm served as a reminder of the importance of being prepared for extreme weather and the vital role emergency services play in keeping communities safe. Despite the challenges, the spirit of the Welsh community shone through, with people coming together to support one another during these trying times. As the region starts to recover from the impact of Storm Frank, residents are encouraged to stay vigilant and continue to work together to build resilience against future weather events.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cambridgeshire teen felt 'not believed' after abuse probe dropped,"Chris Gould's parents spoke out at the inquest into their daughter's death, expressing their deep disappointment and frustration over how her case was handled by mental health services in the weeks leading up to her tragic demise. The 17-year-old, who was an informal patient at the Hinton House Adolescent Mental Health Unit in Cambridgeshire, took her own life in January 2019. Her grieving parents told the inquest that clinicians felt Chris was not being entirely truthful about the extent of her self-harming behaviour and her intentions towards taking her own life. The family's solicitor, Katie O'Connor, described how Chris felt ""not believed"" and ""not taken seriously"" by the mental health professionals involved in her care. O'Connor stated that this lack of belief and understanding from the professionals may have contributed to Chris's belief that there was no other option but to end her life. The inquest heard evidence from several mental health professionals who had been involved in Chris's care, including nurses and psychiatrists. It was revealed that Chris had been discharged from the mental health unit on the day she died, despite expressing suicidal thoughts during her final assessment. The inquest also heard from the family, who described Chris as a ""bright, articulate, and funny"" teenager. They spoke about her struggles with anxiety, depression, and self-harm, and how they had tried to get help for her through various channels, including their GP and mental health services. The family's account of their interactions with mental health professionals was at times harrowing, with descriptions of their daughter's desperation and pleas for help being dismissed or ignored. The parents also expressed their concern that their daughter was not being given the appropriate level of care and support, and that her needs were not being fully understood or addressed. The inquest continues, with the family and their legal team seeking answers as to why Chris was not given the help she needed, and why her concerns and warnings of suicidal thoughts were not taken seriously by mental health professionals. The family's story is a tragic reminder of the importance of listening to and believing young people when they express their mental health struggles and suicidal thoughts. It is a call to action for mental health services to do better in supporting and believing those in their care, and to ensure that no family ever has to go through the pain and loss that Chris's family has experienced. As the inquest continues, the family and their legal team will be seeking answers as to why Chris was not given the help she needed, and why her concerns and warnings of suicidal thoughts were not taken seriously by mental health professionals.

Chase criticised for 'mocking' customers' spending habits,"By Georgina Rannard, BBC News Offering financial advice on Twitter, the bank appeared to chastise consumers who question their low bank balances but buy take-away coffee. The tweet, which has since been deleted, read: ""Why buy a pricey coffee every day when you could put that money into your savings account instead?"" The comment did not go unnoticed by social media users, who were quick to criticise Chase for mocking customers' spending habits. Some argued that everyone deserves a treat, no matter their financial situation, while others pointed out that small luxury purchases can actually help people manage their stress and improve their mental health. The bank's tweet sparked a heated debate about the role of financial institutions in shaming customers for their spending choices. Some argued that it is the responsibility of individuals to manage their money wisely, while others believed that banks have a duty to provide affordable financial products and services to help people save. Chase has since issued an apology for the tweet, acknowledging that it may have come across as insensitive. ""We apologise for any offense caused by our recent tweet,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Our intention was to provide helpful financial advice, not to judge or criticise individuals' spending habits."" However, some customers were not convinced by the apology, with many expressing their frustration and disappointment on social media. ""I've been a loyal customer of Chase for years, but this tweet has really put me off,"" one user wrote. ""It's not our place for banks to be telling us what we can and can't afford to spend our money on."" Others argued that the tweet was part of a wider trend of financial institutions using shaming tactics to encourage people to save more money. ""It's not just Chase,"" one user wrote. ""I've seen similar tweets from other banks and financial institutions. It's a shame that they feel the need to resort to these tactics instead of offering genuinely affordable and accessible financial products."" The debate highlights the complex relationship between consumers and financial institutions, with many arguing that banks have a responsibility to provide affordable and accessible financial products and services, while also recognising that individuals have the right to make their own spending choices. In the end, it may be time for banks to rethink their approach to financial advice and avoid using shaming tactics that can be hurtful and counterproductive. Instead, they could focus on providing practical and helpful advice that empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions, while also recognising that small treats and luxuries are an important part of life for many people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ashish: My LFW catwalk reflects British diversity,"By Hannah Moore, Newsbeat reporter The designer's multicoloured ""midnight market"" theme was inspired by the sequin shops of his home city, Delhi, and featured models of different ethnicities strutting down the London Fashion Week catwalk. Ashish Gupta, the man behind the brand, believes that fashion should reflect the diversity of real life. Ashish, who was born in India but grew up in London, has always been passionate about breaking down barriers in the fashion industry. He's known for his vibrant and eclectic designs, which combine Eastern and Western influences. ""I grew up in a multicultural community in London, and I've always been surrounded by different cultures and communities,"" he explains. ""I want my fashion to reflect that."" Ashish's LFW show was a celebration of diversity, with models of different ethnicities, body types, and ages taking to the catwalk. There were South Asian models wearing sarees with western-style blazers, Nigerian models rocking traditional headwraps, and plus-size models in bold, colourful outfits. ""Fashion should represent people in real life, not just a narrow idea of what's beautiful,"" Ashish says. ""I think it's important for young people, especially those from minority backgrounds, to see themselves represented in fashion."" Ashish's designs have been worn by celebrities such as Rihanna, Solange Knowles, and MIA, and his brand has become a favourite among fashion-forward young people. His fans love his bold, colourful pieces, which often feature sequins, glitter, and intricate embroidery. But Ashish's success hasn't come without challenges. He's faced criticism from some quarters for his use of traditional Indian clothing in his designs, with some accusing him of cultural appropriation. Ashish, however, insists that his designs are a celebration of diversity, rather than an attempt to appropriate other cultures. ""I'm not trying to appropriate anyone's culture,"" he says. ""I'm just trying to celebrate the richness and diversity of the world around me. I think it's important for us to embrace and celebrate each other's differences, rather than trying to erase them."" As the fashion industry continues to grapple with issues of diversity and representation, Ashish Gupta remains a trailblazer. His LFW show was a reminder that fashion is for everyone, regardless of their race, size, or background. And with his bold, colourful designs, Ashish is helping to redefine what it means to be fashionable in the 21st century.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ex-Australian PMs make appeal over Bali Nine drug pair,"Androleas Tasmanis and Kevin Rudd, two former prime ministers of Australia, have made an appeal to the Indonesian government to show mercy towards Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, the two Australian citizens sentenced to death for their involvement in the Bali Nine drug trafficking case in 2006. In a joint statement released on Thursday, Tasmanis and Rudd urged Indonesian President Joko Widodo to reconsider the fate of Chan and Sukumaran. They emphasized that the two men have undergone significant rehabilitation since their sentencing and have become models for prison reform. ""We believe that the actions of Myuran and Andrew since their conviction demonstrate a deep commitment to rehabilitation and the betterment of themselves and others,"" the former prime ministers wrote. ""They have become positive influences on their fellow inmates and have inspired many to turn their lives around."" Chan and Sukumaran were arrested in 2005 while attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin out of Bali. They were sentenced to death in 2006 after being found guilty of leading the Bali Nine drug trafficking group. Since their sentencing, the pair have been active in prison reform initiatives, teaching English and art classes to fellow inmates, and working to reduce violence and improve living conditions in Indonesian prisons. They have also become advocates for drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation. Tasmanis and Rudd pointed out that Indonesian law allows for clemency in cases where the prisoner has shown remorse and undergone significant rehabilitation. They argued that Chan and Sukumaran meet these criteria and that granting them clemency would be a positive step towards improving the Indonesian justice system. ""We urge President Widodo to consider granting clemency to Myuran and Andrew, not only as a matter of compassion but also as a recognition of the progress they have made towards rehabilitation,"" the former prime ministers wrote. Their appeal comes after a recent spate of executions in Indonesia, which has drawn international criticism. In April 2015, the Indonesian government executed 14 people, including six convicted drug traffickers, despite widespread protests from human rights groups and foreign governments. The case of Chan and Sukumaran has attracted global attention, with celebrities such as Pink and Nick Cave appealing for their release. The Australian government has also reportedly been in talks with Indonesian authorities to seek clemency for the pair. Tasmanis and Rudd acknowledged the sensitivity of the issue and the complexities of the Indonesian justice system, but they urged President Widodo to consider the case of Chan and Sukumaran in the context of prison reform and the potential for positive change.

"Sir Alan Parker, director of Bugsy Malone and Evita, dies aged 76","The double Oscar nominee, Sir Alan Parker, passed away at the age of 76 on Wednesday, leaving behind a rich legacy in the world of film and theatre. Known for his distinctive directorial style and innovative storytelling, Parker's influence on the industry will be felt for generations to come. Evita composer Andrew Lloyd Webber led the tributes, tweeting, ""So sad to hear of Sir Alan Parker's death. A brilliant and inspired filmmaker, who gave us Bugsy Malone, Midnight Express, Evita, Mississippi Burning and so many other great films. My deepest sympathies to his family and friends."" Born in Islington, London, on February 14, 1944, Parker began his career in advertising before transitioning to film in the late 1960s. He made his directorial debut with the groundbreaking gangster musical ""Bugsy Malone"" in 1976, which featured an all-child cast and innovative split-screen techniques. The film was a critical and commercial success and established Parker as a rising talent in the industry. Parker's next project, ""Midnight Express,"" was a gritty and harrowing exploration of the Turkish prison system. The film earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Director and made a star out of Brad Davis. In the 1980s, Parker turned his attention to more socially conscious films, including ""Mississippi Burning,"" which explored the deep-rooted racism in the American South, and ""The Commitments,"" a musical comedy-drama about an Irish soul band. Both films were critical and commercial successes and showcased Parker's ability to tackle complex social issues with nuance and sensitivity. Parker's adaptation of ""Angela's Ashes"" in 1999 was a powerful and moving portrayal of poverty and hardship in Ireland. The film was a departure for Parker in terms of tone and subject matter, but he handled the material with the same care and attention to detail that he brought to all of his projects. One of Parker's most ambitious projects was his adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ""Evita,"" which starred Madonna as the Argentine political figure Eva PerÃ³n. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning Parker his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Parker's later films included ""Birdy,"" ""The Road to Wellville,"" and ""Angel Heart,"" which showcased his versatility as a filmmaker. He continued to work on projects up until his death, including an adaptation of the graphic novel ""Fastrack."" Throughout his career, Sir Alan Parker was known for his collaborative spirit and innovative approach to filmmaking.

War Horse musicians lose legal bid,"The musicians of the highly acclaimed ""War Horse"" production took legal action last week following the National Theatre's decision to end their contribution of playing live over a pre-recorded soundtrack. They had sought an injunction to be allowed back into the theatre, arguing that the use of a pre-recorded soundtrack would diminish the authenticity and overall impact of the production. The musicians, who have been an integral part of the show since its inception in 2007, expressed their disappointment and concern over the theatre's decision. In a statement, they said, ""We have always taken great pride in our role in bringing the story of 'War Horse' to life through our music. To have that role taken away from us without consultation is both disheartening and frustrating."" The National Theatre, however, maintained that the use of a pre-recorded soundtrack was a necessary cost-saving measure in the current economic climate. A spokesperson for the theatre said, ""We understand the musicians' concerns, but we must make difficult decisions in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the production. The use of a pre-recorded soundtrack will allow us to reduce our operating costs and keep the show running for as long as possible."" The musicians, represented by the Musicians' Union, argued that the live music was an essential element of the production, and that the use of a pre-recorded soundtrack would not only compromise the authenticity of the show but also negatively impact the audience experience. The case was heard at the High Court in London this week, with the judge ultimately ruling in favour of the National Theatre. The musicians were granted costs but were not granted the injunction they had sought. The decision has been met with disappointment and anger from the musicians and their supporters. The Musicians' Union has called on the National Theatre to reconsider its decision and to engage in meaningful consultation with the musicians before making any changes to the production. Despite the setback, the musicians remain committed to finding a solution and to continuing their involvement in ""War Horse."" In a statement, they said, ""We will continue to explore all options for finding a way to keep our music a part of this beloved production. We believe that live music is essential to the success of 'War Horse' and we will not give up our fight to ensure that it remains a part of the show."" The National Theatre, for its part, has said that it remains open to dialogue with the musicians and is committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. The future of the musicians' role in ""War Horse"" remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the musicians will not go quietly into the night. They will continue to fight for their right to contribute to a production that they have been a part of for over a decade.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Taiwan loses diplomatic ally as Dominican Republic switches ties to China,"Taiwan has expressed profound disappointment following the Dominican Republic's decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, deepening Taiwan's diplomatic isolation. The Caribbean nation made the announcement on September 2, 2021, marking a significant blow to Taiwan's international standing. The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing its ""deep regret and strong protest"" over the Dominican Republic's decision. The statement reiterated that Taiwan and China are two distinct political entities and that countries cannot recognize both at the same time. The Chinese Foreign Ministry welcomed the Dominican Republic's decision and hailed it as a ""positive step"" towards the ""normalization of China-Dominican Republic relations."" Beijing has long pursued a diplomatic strategy of wooing away Taiwan's diplomatic allies, using economic incentives and diplomatic pressure to achieve its goals. Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, warned that other countries may follow the Dominican Republic's lead, and urged them to think carefully before making such a move. He emphasized that Taiwan would continue to uphold its values and contribute to the international community, despite its diplomatic challenges. The Dominican Republic's decision comes at a sensitive time for Taiwan, which is facing increased pressure from China over its political status. In recent years, China has stepped up its military activities in the Taiwan Strait, raising tensions between the two sides. The international community has expressed concern over the situation and called for peace and stability in the region. The United States, which is a key ally of Taiwan, has condemned the Dominican Republic's decision and urged other countries to respect Taiwan's international space. The US State Department issued a statement expressing ""serious concerns"" over the move and reiterated its commitment to supporting Taiwan's international participation and engagement. The European Union, another important player in the region, has also expressed its concern over the situation. EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called on all parties to respect international law and to avoid actions that could escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation is a long-standing issue, with only a handful of countries recognizing it as a sovereign state. The loss of another diplomatic ally is a reminder of the challenges Taiwan faces in maintaining its international presence. However, Taiwan has shown resilience in the face of these challenges, continuing to build economic and diplomatic ties with other countries and contributing to the global community in various ways. Despite the challenges, Taiwan remains committed to promoting peace and stability in the region and to upholding its democratic values. It will continue to engage with the international community and to seek new opportunities for cooperation and dialogue. The Dominican Republic's decision may be a setback, but it will not deter Taiwan from pursuing its goals.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Prison staff misconduct investigations rise by third,"Prison staff misconduct investigations in the United Kingdom have seen a significant surge in the past year, with more than 2,500 charges being investigated in 2018-19, representing a rise of over 30% compared to the previous year. The figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, reveal a concerning trend of alleged misconduct within the prison system. The majority of investigations related to two primary areas: alleged breach of security and the use of unnecessary force. Breach of security can encompass a wide range of infractions, including bringing contraband into jails, smuggling drugs or mobile phones, and failing to follow proper protocols for managing inmates. Such breaches can pose a serious threat to prison safety and security, as well as undermine efforts to rehabilitate inmates. The increase in security-related misconduct investigations may be attributed to several factors, including the rise in the number of illicit items being discovered within prisons, as well as the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of mobile phones being found in prisons, with some estimates suggesting that up to 10,000 contraband phones are currently in circulation. The proliferation of these devices has led to a rise in incidents of violence and other forms of criminal activity within prisons. The second most common category of misconduct investigations involved the use of unnecessary force by prison staff. This can include instances of excessive use of force during cell extractions, searches, or other interactions with inmates. Such incidents can result in serious injuries to inmates, as well as damaging the relationship between staff and prisoners. The Prison Service has emphasized the importance of de-escalation techniques and the use of minimal force in all interactions with inmates. The Prison Service has expressed its commitment to addressing these issues and ensuring that prison staff uphold the highest standards of conduct. This includes increased training for staff on de-escalation techniques, as well as more stringent checks on new recruits to ensure they meet the necessary standards. The Service has also announced plans to roll out body-worn cameras for staff in high-risk areas to help improve transparency and accountability. Despite these efforts, however, it is clear that there is still much work to be done to address the issue of misconduct within the prison system. The increase in investigations is a sign that there are significant challenges that need to be addressed, and that more resources and support are needed to ensure that staff are able to maintain the necessary standards of conduct. Ultimately, the safety and well-being of prisoners, as well as the wider community, depend on the effective management of these challenges.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Theresa May warning over police targets 'comeback',"She told the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales that the government had scrapped ""top-down diktats"" and urged police confidence in the new policing approach. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, acknowledged the challenges faced by the police force in recent years, particularly the criticism surrounding performance targets. ""I want to reassure you all that the coalition government is committed to supporting you in your vital work,"" she said, addressing the association's annual conference. ""We understand the importance of police autonomy and local decision-making. I am determined to ensure that we do not return to the days of unrealistic targets and micromanagement."" May emphasized that the government's policy shift would allow the police to focus on community engagement and problem-solving, rather than being preoccupied with meeting specific performance indicators. She acknowledged that the previous targets had created unnecessary pressure on the police and had been a source of frustration for both officers and the public. The Home Secretary also defended the government's decision to reduce the number of police officers through natural wastage and attrition. She argued that the police force had become bloated under Labour, with an excessive focus on numbers rather than effectiveness. Instead, she said, the government was investing in new technology and training to ensure that officers were better equipped to deal with the challenges of modern policing. May also addressed concerns over police funding, acknowledging that budgets had been tight due to the economic crisis. She promised that the government would provide additional resources to support the police in their work, particularly in areas such as cybercrime and counter-terrorism. In conclusion, May sought to reassure the police that the government was committed to supporting them in their work and would not return to the top-down targets and micromanagement of the past. She emphasized the importance of police autonomy and local decision-making, and promised additional resources to help officers tackle the challenges of modern policing. The Home Secretary's speech was met with a cautious welcome from the police association, with some expressing concerns over the government's ability to deliver on its promises. Nonetheless, May's commitment to scrapping performance targets and giving the police more autonomy was seen as a positive step by many in the force, who hoped that it would lead to a more effective and efficient policing approach.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
West Midlands submits bid for Channel 4 relocation,"The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) has submitted a compelling bid to the government for Channel 4's relocation, estimating that the move could significantly boost the region's economy by an impressive Â£5bn over the next decade. This ambitious proposal comes as part of a government consultation seeking potential new locations for the national public service broadcaster. The WMCA's proposition, which has been endorsed by local authorities and business leaders, is built on the region's unique strengths and opportunities. The area boasts a diverse and talented workforce, world-class universities, and a thriving creative industry, all of which would provide an ideal setting for Channel 4's continued growth and innovation. The potential economic benefits of the move are significant. It is expected that the broadcaster's arrival would create thousands of new jobs, not only in the media sector but also in related industries such as technology, marketing, and production. Furthermore, the production of more locally-relevant content would stimulate tourism, attracting visitors from across the country and beyond. Moreover, the WMCA believes that Channel 4's presence would reinforce the region's growing reputation as a hub for creative industries. The area already hosts several successful businesses and institutions, such as the BBC's The Voice UK, the BFI Film and TV School, and the National Film and Television School. The addition of Channel 4 would create a critical mass of creative talent and resources, attracting further investment and fostering collaboration and innovation. In addition to economic benefits, the WMCA emphasizes the cultural significance of Channel 4's presence in the region. The broadcaster's commitment to diversity and inclusivity aligns with the values and aspirations of the West Midlands community. The region's rich cultural heritage and vibrant creative scene would provide a fertile ground for Channel 4 to produce content that reflects and resonates with a diverse audience. The WMCA's bid is just the first step in the process. The government's consultation is ongoing, and any decision on Channel 4's relocation will be subject to careful consideration and scrutiny. Nevertheless, the WMCA remains optimistic about the prospects of a successful bid and the potential benefits that a move to the West Midlands could bring. In conclusion, the WMCA's bid for Channel 4's relocation represents an exciting opportunity for the West Midlands to build on its strengths and attract new investment, jobs, and cultural significance. The potential economic and cultural benefits of the move are significant, and the WMCA remains hopeful that the government will recognize the region's potential as a suitable home for the national public service broadcaster.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Bristol friends raise Â£5,500 after free school meal upset","Chloe and Imogen Wood, two friends from Bristol, were deeply disturbed after learning about the meager contents of free school meal packages provided to families in need.

They decided to approach local businesses and organizations for additional support, explaining the importance of providing nutritious meals for children from low-income families. The response was overwhelming. Within days, the friends had secured generous donations from various companies, which included fresh produce, dairy products, and baked goods. These contributions would significantly enhance the quality and variety of meals provided through the free school meals scheme. As the weeks passed, the campaign continued to gain momentum.

Ronan Kerr's brother attacks Tom Elliott 'scum' remarks,"Tom Elliott's provocative remarks towards individuals waving Irish flags at Omagh Leisure Centre have sparked a strong response from the Kerr family, with Ronan's older brother, Cathair, taking a firm stance against the derogatory language used. In a series of tweets, Cathair Kerr expressed his disappointment and frustration over Tom Elliott's comments, which he deemed to be prejudiced and divisive. He wrote, ""People need to understand that waving a flag is a symbol of pride and identity, not a mark of disrespect or a reason to be labelled as the 'scum of Sinn Fein'. Such language only serves to fuel tensions and perpetuate negative stereotypes."" Cathair's words were a reflection of the deep-rooted sensitivities and emotions that still exist within the Northern Irish community, particularly in relation to issues of identity and nationalism. For many, the flying of Irish flags is a powerful symbol of their cultural heritage and connection to their past. Tom Elliott, a radio presenter for the station TalkSport, had made the comments during a live broadcast, in which he described the scene at Omagh Leisure Centre as ""disgusting"" and accused those waving the flags of being ""Sinn Fein supporters"". His words were met with swift condemnation from various quarters, with many viewing his comments as an unwarranted attack on a peaceful expression of identity. Cathair Kerr's intervention in the matter was significant, not only because of his personal connection to the issue, but also because of his prominent role in the local community. He is a well-known figure in Omagh, serving as the vice-chairman of the local GAA club and a respected businessman. His words carried weight and resonated with many within the community, who saw his response as a powerful statement against intolerance and bigotry. The incident also highlighted the importance of language and the power it holds to shape perceptions and fuel tensions. Tom Elliott's use of the term ""scum"" was particularly inflammatory, and served to belittle and dehumanise those he was targeting. Cathair Kerr's call for understanding and respect for diversity was a timely reminder of the need for dialogue and empathy in times of division. As the incident continued to generate headlines and spark debate, it served as a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing Northern Irish society in its journey towards reconciliation and healing. The incident also underscored the need for continued efforts to promote understanding, respect and tolerance within the community, and to challenge divisive language and attitudes wherever they arise.

New Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander,"The appointment of Mr. Danny Alexander to his second Cabinet post in less than a month marks the next step in his rapid political rise. Virtually unknown outside the Westminster bubble just a few years ago, the Liberal Democrat MP for the Scottish constituency of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has now established himself as a key figure in the Coalition Government. Born in 1977 in the Scottish Highlands, Alexander studied at the University of Edinburgh before working as a researcher for former Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace. In 2005, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Inverness, and was swiftly promoted to the junior ministerial position of Chief Whip. Alexander's meteoric rise continued when he was appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in November 2010, following the resignation of David Laws over an expenses scandal. In this role, he is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Treasury, and will play a key role in implementing the Coalition's spending cuts and economic policies. Despite his relatively young age and lack of experience in economics, Alexander has impressed many with his quick wit, intelligence and ability to learn on the job. He has also demonstrated a keen understanding of the political landscape, and has been praised for his ability to negotiate with his colleagues and opponents. However, Alexander's appointment has not been without controversy. Critics have argued that he was given the position due to his Scottish background and the need to appease the Scottish National Party. Others have questioned his lack of economic experience, and have raised concerns about his role in the expenses scandal that led to Laws' resignation. Despite these criticisms, Alexander has remained focused on his duties as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He has worked closely with Chancellor George Osborne to implement the Coalition's spending review, and has been instrumental in securing agreement on a number of contentious issues. Alexander's political rise has been meteoric, and he has quickly established himself as a key figure in the Coalition Government. However, with the challenges ahead in implementing the Coalition's spending cuts and economic policies, he will need to continue to impress if he is to maintain his position and continue his rise through the political ranks. As the economic situation in the UK continues to evolve, and the Coalition Government faces increasing pressure to deliver results, Alexander's role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury will be crucial. With his quick wit, intelligence and ability to learn on the job, he is well-positioned to take on the challenges ahead and continue his rise in British politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Childcare recruitment 'catastrophe' looms, say campaigners","By Judith Burns, Education reporter A looming childcare recruitment crisis has been warned by campaigners, as new requirements for key workers to hold GCSE C grades or equivalent qualifications in relevant subjects take effect. The Save our Early Years (SOEY) campaign, which represents early years educators and childminders, has said the changes will further exacerbate an existing recruitment crisis in the sector. Previously, alternative qualifications such as Functional Skills or NVQs were accepted in place of GCSEs. However, the Department for Education (DfE) announced in December 2020 that these qualifications would no longer be accepted for new recruits from September 2021. SOEY's research indicates that over a third of the early years workforce do not hold GCSEs in English and Maths, let alone in relevant subjects such as Science or ICT. This issue is further compounded by the fact that only 16% of early years trainees met the GCSE requirement in 2020. The campaign argues that these new requirements will make it even more difficult for early years settings to attract and retain staff, especially given the sector's low pay and long hours. ""This is a recipe for disaster,"" said Anita Kumar, founder of SOEY. ""The government is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy â by making it harder for early years settings to recruit staff, they're only going to exacerbate the problem and increase the demand for expensive private tutors to help staff meet these new requirements."" The DfE has defended the changes, stating that GCSEs are a ""gold standard qualification"" and that alternative qualifications do not provide the same depth of knowledge. However, critics argue that these requirements disproportionately affect those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are more likely to have attended schools with lower GCSE pass rates and may not have had access to the same educational opportunities. ""The government is ignoring the fact that GCSEs are not the only measure of a person's ability to be a successful early years practitioner,"" said Kumar. ""The focus should be on ensuring that all children have access to high-quality early years education, regardless of their background or the qualifications of their teachers."" The SOEY campaign is calling on the government to reverse the decision and reinstate alternative qualifications for new recruits. They also want the government to address the root causes of the recruitment crisis, such as low pay and long hours, to make the sector an attractive career choice for those with or without GCSEs. As the new academic year begins, the childcare sector faces a uncertain future, with the potential for a major recruitment crisis looming on the horizon. The government must act now to prevent this from happening and ensure that all children have access to the high-quality early years education they",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

However, the #elpasoCHALLENGE has provided a glimmer of hope and positivity in the wake of the horrific event. Martinez's courage and compassion have served as an inspiration, reminding people of the importance of empathy, kindness, and community solidarity. The shooting incident also brought attention to the issue of gun violence and the need for stronger gun control laws. Martinez's initiative has become a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity, and it has sparked a much-needed conversation about how we can come together as a community to address the root causes of violence and promote peace and understanding. The #elpasoCHALLENGE is just one of many initiatives that have emerged in the aftermath of the shooting.

NSA workers disciplined over Snowden leaks,"The employee, identified as a contractor with access to highly sensitive information, was among three National Security Agency (NSA) workers sanctioned over the Snowden leaks incident, according to an internal NSA memo obtained by the BBC. This marks the first disciplinary action taken by the agency following the revelations of extensive government surveillance programs. The memo, which was sent to all NSA employees on Tuesday, outlined the details of the disciplinary actions against the trio. The contractor, whose name has not been disclosed, is said to have failed to comply with agency procedures regarding the handling of classified material. Specifically, the contractor is accused of failing to report several instances of possible unauthorized accesses to sensitive data, including the alleged leaks to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The two other employees, both civilian NSA staffers, are alleged to have made unauthorized searches of databases containing top secret intelligence. While the extent of their involvement is not yet clear, they have been suspended from their duties and are currently under investigation. The memo stressed that the security breaches were a serious matter and a violation of the trust placed in NSA employees and contractors. It reminded staff of their obligations to protect classified information and to report any suspected violations. ""The potential compromise of sensitive information is a matter of grave concern to NSA and to the entire intelligence community,"" the memo stated. ""Each and every one of us plays a critical role in protecting this information and ensuring the security of our nation."" The disciplinary actions come as the NSA faces increased scrutiny over its surveillance programs following the Snowden leaks. The leaks, which began in June 2013, revealed extensive details about the agency's activities, including the collection of phone and internet data from millions of Americans. The revelations sparked a national debate over privacy and government transparency. Since the leaks, the NSA has taken steps to improve its security procedures and to increase transparency. This includes the implementation of new policies to limit access to sensitive data and to improve oversight and accountability. However, the agency has faced continued criticism from civil liberties groups and some members of Congress, who argue that the surveillance programs infringe on Americans' privacy rights. The disciplinary actions against the three employees are a reminder that the consequences of failing to follow proper procedures can be significant. They also underscore the importance of vigilance in protecting sensitive information and maintaining the trust of the American people. The NSA has not commented on the disciplinary actions beyond the contents of the memo. It is not clear whether further disciplinary actions or criminal charges are pending against the employees. However, the incident serves as a reminder that the consequences of carelessness or disregard for security protocols can have far-reaching implications. While the disciplinary actions are a step in the right direction, they are just one piece of a larger puzzle.

Speaking in the House of Lords on Monday, Lord Henley acknowledged the potential benefits of the project, which includes generating clean energy and creating jobs in the area. However, he emphasized the need for a thorough assessment of the project's financial viability and value for money. Lord Henley said, ""A decision will be taken at the appropriate time. This project is complex, and it requires careful consideration. We are determined to get it right, and that is why we are taking the time to ensure that all aspects of the project are thoroughly assessed."" Conservative peer Lady Finn, who sits on the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, called on the government to ""cut the delays"" and make a decision on the project. She argued that the project could bring significant benefits to the Swansea Bay area and the wider economy. Lady Finn said, ""It is now over a year since the report was published, and we are still waiting for a decision. This project has the potential to create jobs, generate clean energy, and boost the economy. It is time for the government to act."" However, Lord Henley maintained that the government would not be rushed into making a decision. He acknowledged the public and political pressure to move forward but emphasized the importance of making an informed decision based on a thorough assessment of the project's financial viability. Lord Henley added, ""I understand the frustration that we have not yet reached a decision, but we must ensure that we take a responsible and sustainable approach. We cannot afford to make the wrong decision, and that is why we are taking the time to get it right."" The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project aims to build a 9.5km-long sea wall to capture the tidal energy from the Severn Estuary. The project is estimated to generate around 120MW of electricity, enough to power around 150,000 homes. However, the project has faced criticism over its costs, which are estimated to be around Â£1.3 billion, and whether it represents good value for money. Despite the delays, supporters of the project remain optimistic that it will eventually go ahead. Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Ltd, the company behind the project, has previously stated that it is willing to work with the government to find a solution that is financially viable and delivers the benefits of the project to the area. In conclusion, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project remains a contentious issue, with some calling for a swift decision and others advocating for a thorough assessment of the project's financial viability.

Manila district police force removed after teen deaths,"Manila police chief Oscar Albayalde announced on Wednesday that 1,200 officers from the Caloocan district would be retrained and then assigned to other units, following the deaths of two teenagers during police operations in recent weeks. The move comes amid growing scrutiny of police operations in the metropolitan area and calls for accountability from human rights groups and the public. The first incident occurred on March 16, when 14-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos was allegedly killed by members of the Caloocan City Police Station 3 after being accused of carrying a gun. The police claimed that they had acted in self-defense, but CCTV footage later emerged showing that the boy was unarmed when he was shot in the head. The incident sparked widespread outrage and calls for justice, with many accusing the police of planting evidence and fabricating a story to justify the use of lethal force. Just over a week later, on March 29, 19-year-old Carl Angelo Arnaiz was shot and killed by officers in the nearby town of Cubao. According to police reports, Arnaiz had robbed a convenience store and was resisting arrest when he was shot. However, his family and witnesses disputed this account, saying that the young man had been on his way home from a birthday party when he was stopped by police. The incident was captured on CCTV, but the footage has not been made public. Both incidents have highlighted the need for reform within the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Caloocan district in particular. Albayalde acknowledged that there were ""areas for improvement"" within the force and that the retraining and reassignment of officers was a necessary step towards addressing these issues. He also pledged to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations into the incidents and to ensure that those responsible were held to account. However, human rights groups and opposition politicians have called for more fundamental reforms within the PNP, including the establishment of an independent oversight body to investigate police abuses and the implementation of stricter guidelines on the use of force. They have also criticized the government's war on drugs, which has seen thousands of suspected drug users and dealers killed since it was launched in 2016, for creating an environment in which police abuses can thrive. The Caloocan incidents are just the latest in a long line of controversial police operations that have raised serious concerns about the rule of law and human rights in the Philippines. As the country grapples with these issues, it remains to be seen whether the government will take meaningful action to address them and bring about real change within the police force.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stars stay silent in X Factor protest,"By Ian Youngs, Entertainment Reporter, BBC News Madness star Suggs and dance acts Orbital and Pendulum were among those who chose to remain silent in a recording studio last night, as part of a protest against The X Factor. The group of artists were recreating composer John Cage's seminal work 4'33"", which consists of four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence. The unusual performance was in response to ongoing criticism of the popular ITV singing competition's treatment of its contestants. The protest was organised by the music industry collective, the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM), who have long expressed concerns about the exploitation of artists on reality TV shows. Speaking to BBC News, ISM chief executive Deborah Annetts explained the reasoning behind the protest. ""The X Factor and similar shows can put immense pressure on artists to perform, often with little control over the final product or their image,"" she said. ""This can lead to a loss of artistic integrity and a lack of fair compensation for their work."" As the studio lights dimmed and the clock ticked, the audience held their breath, anticipating the unexpected. The only sounds in the room were the occasional cough or rustle of programmes, as the artists remained resolutely still. The silence was broken only by the gentle hum of the studio equipment and the occasional shuffling of feet. The protest was not without its detractors, with some critics arguing that it was a self-indulgent stunt that failed to address the real issues. However, many in the music industry saw it as a powerful statement, highlighting the need for greater transparency and fairness in the way that artists are treated and compensated. ""It's important that we raise awareness of the challenges that artists face in the music industry, particularly those who are starting out,"" Annetts continued. ""This protest is just the beginning, and we hope that it will spark a wider conversation about the value of music and the rights of artists."" As the four minutes and thirty-three seconds drew to a close, the artists stood up, taking their bows to a standing ovation from the audience. While the silence may have been broken, the message of the protest was clear - the artists demanded to be heard. The protest comes as The X Factor prepares for its 17th series, which will see Simon Cowell return as a judge for the first time since 2013. The ITV show has been criticised for its treatment of contestants in the past, with allegations of bullying and exploitation. The ISM has previously called for a statutory register of music producers, to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the industry. As the debate continues, one thing is for certain - the silence of the stars has spoken louder than words.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Monmouthshire and Newport get 30 new electric car points,"A new scheme aimed at boosting the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging points in Monmouthshire and Newport has been announced, with 30 new points set to be installed in the coming months. The initiative is being funded through a combination of European Union (EU), Welsh Government, and Monmouthshire council grants. A total of 20 businesses in Monmouthshire will benefit from free installation of EV charging points, providing an incentive for their customers to make the switch to electric cars. These charging points will be installed at locations including Monmouth, Abergavenny, Chepstow, and Caldicot. The scheme is expected to not only encourage the use of EVs but also support local businesses by attracting more customers. Monmouthshire council has also announced plans to install ten more charging points in most Monmouthshire town centre car parks. This will provide convenient charging options for those who live or work in the area and are unable to charge their cars at home. These charging points will be located in areas with high footfall, making them easily accessible to a large number of people. The Welsh Government has welcomed the scheme, stating that it is in line with their commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting the use of electric vehicles. The EU's Just Transition Fund, which is providing the majority of the funding for the project, is designed to support regions that are heavily reliant on traditional industries, such as coal mining, to transition to a low-carbon economy. The installation of these charging points is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. Monmouthshire council has urged residents and businesses to register their interest in having a charging point installed at their premises as soon as possible, as demand is likely to be high. The new charging points will be added to the Zap-Map, the UK's most comprehensive database of EV charging points. This will make it easier for drivers to locate charging points when they are on the move, helping to reduce range anxiety and making electric vehicles a more practical option for everyday use. The installation of these charging points is just one of many initiatives being undertaken by Monmouthshire council to promote the use of electric vehicles. The council has also announced plans to purchase electric vehicles for its own fleet and is exploring the possibility of creating a network of EV charging points along major transport routes in the county. The scheme is expected to have a positive impact on the environment, with the use of electric vehicles producing significantly fewer emissions than petrol or diesel cars. It will also help to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. In conclusion, the installation of 30 new EV charging points in Monmouthshire and Newport is a significant step forward in promoting the use of electric vehicles in the region. The combination of funding from the EU, Welsh Government, and Monmouthshire council will enable the installation of charging points in key locations, making them",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"The Apprentice: Series launch down 900,000 viewers","Thursday evening's opening episode on BBC One attracted an average of 5.5 million viewers, a 26.3% share of the available viewing audience. The launch of last year's series attracted an average of 6.4 million viewers, marking a decrease of nearly 900,000 viewers for this year's premiere. The Apprentice, Lord Sugar's popular business reality competition, returned to our screens with a new series and a fresh batch of hopeful candidates vying for a place in his business empire. However, the initial excitement seemed to have waned as compared to the previous year, with a notable dip in viewership. The show, which is renowned for its challenging tasks and unforgiving boardroom scenes, has been a staple in British television for over a decade. Lord Sugar's stern demeanour and no-nonsense approach have made for some memorable moments, keeping viewers hooked year after year. But this time around, the magic might not have worked as expected. Several factors could have contributed to the drop in viewership. For instance, the rise of streaming services and an increasingly crowded television landscape might have drawn viewers away. Additionally, the ongoing pandemic could have affected people's viewing habits, with more time spent on other activities. Despite the decrease in numbers, The Apprentice continues to maintain a significant following. Social media is filled with discussions about the candidates and their performances, demonstrating that the show still manages to engage and entertain its audience. Moreover, it is important to remember that viewer numbers are just one measure of a show's success. The Apprentice has been instrumental in launching several successful business ventures, with past contestants going on to create their own companies and make a name for themselves in various industries. As the series progresses, it will be interesting to see whether the viewership figures pick up, or if this season will continue to trail behind previous ones. Regardless, The Apprentice remains an iconic part of British television, and its impact extends far beyond the realms of ratings.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Jlloyd Samuel death: Footballer's body 'too burnt' for visual ID,"Warrington Coroner's Court heard Samuel died when his Range Rover crashed with another vehicle in Cheshire last May, but the crash was not suspicious. Coroner Alan Moore concluded he died as a result of road traffic collision. However, the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the former Aston Villa and Bolton Wanderers defender's death took an unexpected turn when the identification of his body was proved challenging. The court heard that Samuel's body was discovered in the burnt wreckage of the vehicle, which was completely engulfed in flames following the collision. Forensic experts were unable to use traditional methods to identify the body due to the extensive damage caused by the fire. Instead, they turned to dental records and other methods to make a positive identification. The process took several days, causing further distress to Samuel's family who were already grieving the loss of their loved one. The court also heard evidence from fire investigators who determined that the fire that engulfed the vehicle was accidental, likely caused by a fuel leak following the collision. It was also revealed that Samuel was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, which may have contributed to his injuries. The coroner expressed his sympathies to Samuel's family, praising their courage in attending the inquest and emphasizing the importance of seatbelt use while driving. He also urged drivers to remain vigilant on the roads and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. The inquest concluded with the coroner recording a verdict of death by road traffic collision. The court also heard that Samuel's family had requested that donations in his memory be made to the Burns Unit at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, in recognition of the difficult process involved in identifying his body. Outside the court, Samuel's family issued a statement expressing their gratitude for the support they had received from the football community and the public during this difficult time. They also paid tribute to their loved one, remembering him as a devoted husband and father, a loving son, and a talented footballer. The tragic death of Jlloyd Samuel serves as a reminder of the importance of road safety and the challenges that can arise in the identification process following a fatal accident. The investigation into his death highlighted the essential role of forensic experts and the importance of utilizing alternative methods when traditional identification methods are not possible.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Titanic menu expected to fetch up to Â£70,000 at auction","It was owned by Elise Lurette, who was one of about 700 people who survived after the passenger liner RMS Titanic hit an iceberg in April 1912. She was working as a maid for a family travelling on the ship when it met its tragic end in the North Atlantic. Miraculously, Elise managed to escape the sinking vessel and live to tell the tale. After the disaster, Elise kept several mementos from her time on the Titanic as reminders of the opulence she had witnessed before the unthinkable happened. Among her possessions was a menu from the ship's grand first-class dining room, which she had saved as a keepsake of the lavish meals she had helped serve. The menu, which dates back to April 14, 1912, is now set to be auctioned off, with experts estimating it could fetch up to Â£70,000 ($95,000) at Bonhams auction house in New York City. The menu, which has remained in Elise's family since the disaster, is an incredibly rare survivor from the ill-fated voyage, making it a highly sought-after item for collectors and history enthusiasts alike. The menu features an impressive array of dishes that would have been served on the night of April 14, 1912, before the collision with the iceberg. Appetizers included oysters, consommÃ© Olga, and poached salmon mousse. The main courses ranged from roast duckling, broiled lamb, and roast squab to baked Alaska and peaches in chartreuse. The menu also includes a wine list, with options such as Chateau Margaux, Chateau Latour, and Chateau Lafite Rothschild, which would have been served with the main courses. The fact that the menu has survived, along with the extensive wine list, provides a fascinating glimpse into the luxurious dining experience that passengers enjoyed on the Titanic before its tragic end. Elise's grandson, who currently owns the menu, explained that his grandmother often spoke fondly of the opulence she had witnessed on the Titanic before the disaster. He recalled her stories of the grand dining room, the crystal chandeliers, and the impeccably dressed waiters. The menu serves as a poignant reminder of those stories and the privileged world that Elise had briefly been a part of before her life took a dramatically different turn. The Titanic menu, with its impressive list of dishes and wines, is more than just a piece of paper; it is a tangible link to a bygone era and a reminder of the opulence and luxury that once defined ocean travel.

Shetland Super Puma crash: Co-pilot's actions 'crucial' to survival,"The survivors of the Shetland Super Puma crash on Monday, February13th, 2023, are hailing the actions of their co-pilot as crucial to their survival. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, were among the 18 people on board the helicopter when it went down in the North Sea. The helicopter, operated by CHC Helicopter, was en route from Sullom Voe Terminal to Sumburgh Airport when it experienced mechanical issues and was forced to make an emergency descent. The incident resulted in the helicopter landing in the sea, with the passengers and crew members being rescued by the Royal Navy and RNLI. According to eyewitness accounts and investigations, the co-pilot, who has not been identified, took quick and decisive action to ensure the safety of the passengers. He managed to guide the helicopter to a controlled descent, minimizing the impact of the landing in the sea. The co-pilot's actions prevented the helicopter from flipping over or taking on water, which could have resulted in more severe injuries or fatalities. Ms. Darnley, speaking from her hospital bed, said, ""I was terrified when the helicopter started shaking, but the co-pilot stayed calm, and he kept telling us what to do. He guided us through the emergency procedure, and we all followed his instructions. I am grateful for his quick thinking and bravery."" Mr. McCrossan added, ""The co-pilot was amazing. He kept us all calm and focused, and his actions really saved our lives. We owe him a huge debt of gratitude."" The co-pilot's actions have been praised by emergency responders, who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident. RNLI volunteer, John McLeod, said, ""When we arrived, the helicopter was partially submerged, but the passengers were already out. It was clear that they had been well-prepared for the emergency and that the co-pilot had done an excellent job in guiding them to safety."" The incident is currently being investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), and it is not yet clear what caused the helicopter to experience mechanical issues. However, the quick thinking and actions of the co-pilot have been hailed as a crucial factor in the survival of all on board. Mr. Munro said, ""We're all just grateful to be alive.

Councils reject two-thirds of requests for care,"By Nick Triggle, Health correspondent Nearly 1.85 million requests for support were made last year to local councils in England, but just over 650,000 people received help. This means that two-thirds of those in need were rejected. Councils have been warning for a number of years that a shortage of funding and resources was making it increasingly difficult for them to meet the demand for care. The latest figures, released by the Local Government Association (LGA), reveal the scale of the problem. The LGA says the current system is ""broken"" and that urgent action is needed to ensure those who need care can access it. The organisation, which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, says the root cause of the problem is the lack of funding for social care. The government has previously announced plans to reform the social care system, which has been criticised for being complex and difficult to navigate. But the LGA says more needs to be done to address the immediate crisis. Cllr Jane Morgan, chair of the LGA's Community Wellbeing Board, said: ""These figures are a stark reminder of the human cost of the social care funding crisis. With councils only able to help just over a third of those who need care, we are leaving too many older and disabled people without the vital support they need to live independently and with dignity in their own homes."" The LGA wants the government to provide councils with a fair funding settlement so they can meet the rising demand for care. It also wants the government to reform the social care system, making it simpler and more consistent across the country. The government has previously announced plans to reform the social care system, but these have yet to materialise. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has promised to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". But the LGA says more needs to be done to address the immediate crisis. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates care services in England, has also raised concerns about the state of social care. In a report published last year, it said the current system was ""unsustainable"" and that ""urgent action"" was needed. The CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, said: ""The care system is at breaking point. We are seeing increasing numbers of people being left without the support they need to live safely and independently in their own homes. This is not only having a devastating impact on people's lives, it is also putting immense pressure on the NHS and other public services.""

Japan frees Chinese boat captain amid diplomatic row,"Japan had accused Zhan Qixiong, the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, of deliberately ramming two Japanese patrol vessels near the disputed islands in the East China Sea. The incident, which occurred on September 7th, sparked a diplomatic row between the two Asian powers. China vehemently denied the allegations, with Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying declaring Zhan's detention as ""illegal and invalid."" In response, Beijing cut off ministerial-level contacts with Japan, suspending high-level dialogues and canceling planned meetings. The Japanese Coast Guard claimed that the Chinese boat had rammed their patrol vessels twice within ten minutes, causing damage to one of the boats and endangering the lives of its crew. However, China maintained that the collision was an accident, with Zhan having acted in self-defense against the Japanese vessels that had been pursuing him. Amidst growing tensions, the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo issued a statement calling for the immediate release of Zhan and his crew, and for Japan to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Protests were held in several Chinese cities, with demonstrators calling for a boycott of Japanese goods. The Japanese government, for its part, stood firm in its position, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressing his intention to take stern action against China. The Japanese media fanned the flames of nationalist sentiment, with editorials calling for a tough stance against China and demanding an apology from the Chinese government. However, in a surprising turn of events, Japan announced on September 25th that Zhan and his crew would be released and allowed to return to China. The decision came after high-level talks between Chinese and Japanese officials in Beijing, during which the two sides reportedly agreed to de-escalate tensions and restore ministerial-level contacts. The Chinese government welcomed the decision, with Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying expressing gratitude to Japan for ""making a positive response to China's demands."" China also pledged to take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Japanese officials, for their part, expressed relief that the situation had been defused, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga stating that the release of the captain and his crew was in the interest of maintaining peace and stability in the region. The incident served as a reminder of the sensitive and complex nature of relations between China and Japan, with both sides continuing to jostle for influence and dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. The incident also highlighted the importance of diplomacy and dialogue in resolving disputes and preventing tensions from escalating into full-blown crises.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Solar Impulse aeroplane reaches Ohio,"The zero-fuel aircraft, Solar Impulse 2, arrived in Dayton, Ohio, at 21:56 local time (01:56 GMT) on June 13, 2016, having flown from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 1,113km (691 miles) journey took pilot Andre Borschberg about 16 hours to complete, a relatively short flight time for this groundbreaking solar-powered plane. As Solar Impulse 2 touched down at Dayton International Airport, a cheer erupted from the crowd of onlookers who had gathered to witness this historic moment. The Swiss-made plane, which runs solely on sunlight, had braved the night sky for the first time during its transatlantic journey. Borschberg, who had spent the previous day and night at the helm, described the experience as ""an emotional moment."" He expressed his gratitude to the team for their unwavering support and dedication. ""We are pushing the boundaries of what is possible with renewable energy,"" Borschberg said. ""This is a significant milestone in our quest to prove that clean technologies can achieve the impossible."" The Solar Impulse team, which includes pilots, engineers, and support staff, began their journey in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on March 9, 2015. Their goal was to circumnavigate the globe in the Solar Impulse 2, demonstrating the potential of renewable energy in aviation. The team hoped to show that solar power could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future in air travel. To accomplish this, the Solar Impulse 2 was designed with a wingspan of 72 meters (236 feet), making it larger than a Boeing 747, but much lighter. Weighing in at just 2.3 tons (5,070 lbs), the plane was built with lightweight materials, including carbon fiber and solar cells. The solar cells, which cover the entire surface of the wings, provide the plane with the energy it needs to fly during the day. At night, the plane relies on stored energy in its batteries. The journey has not been without its challenges. The team has faced numerous weather-related delays and had to make unscheduled stops to repair minor issues. However, they have persevered, driven by their passion for renewable energy and their belief in the Solar Impulse project's potential. With Solar Impulse 2's arrival in Dayton, the team celebrated a major milestone in their global expedition. They looked forward to continuing their journey across the United States and eventually, returning to their home base in Switzerland.

Virgin's Unity plane rockets skyward,"By Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Chief pilot, Scotsman Dave Mackay, and co-pilot, American Mike Masucci, took the Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne vehicle to almost 90km in altitude above California's Mojave Desert before gliding back down to Earth. The test flight, which took place on 25 May, represents a significant step forward in the development of the company's innovative rocket system. The LauncherOne rocket is unique in that it is carried aloft under the wing of a modified Boeing 747-400 aircraft, named Cosmic Girl. Once at cruising altitude, the rocket is released and ignites its engine, propelling itself towards the International Space Station (ISS) or other low Earth orbit destinations. The 25 May test flight, which took just over an hour from take-off to splashdown, was the second such launch attempt for Virgin Orbit. The first, in May 2020, was aborted due to a technical issue. This time, however, all systems performed as planned. ""Today's successful test flight is a significant milestone for our team and for the future of small satellite launch,"" Dan Hartman, CEO of Virgin Orbit, said in a statement. ""We're getting closer to our goal of providing reliable, flexible and cost-effective access to space for our customers."" The LauncherOne rocket carries a payload capacity of up to 500kg to orbit, making it a viable option for small satellite operators and research institutions. It is also fully reusable, which could make it a cost-effective solution in the future. The test flight edges Virgin Orbit closer to its goal of providing regular launch services from Spaceport Cornwall in the UK. The company has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Cornwall Council to establish the site, which will be the first horizontal launch spaceport in Europe. The development of the LauncherOne system is part of a wider trend in the space industry towards smaller, more affordable launch vehicles. Companies such as Rocket Lab and Arianespace's Vega C are also developing similar systems. The race to provide regular, affordable access to space is heating up, with governments and private companies investing billions of dollars in the sector. The ultimate goal is to create a thriving market for satellite-based services, from communications and navigation to weather forecasting and Earth observation. The success of the 25 May test flight is a welcome boost for Virgin Orbit, which has faced its fair share of challenges in recent years.

Mobile mast size rules relaxed for better coverage across Wales,"In a move to improve mobile coverage across Wales and bring it in line with the rest of the UK, the Welsh Government has announced that masts of up to 25 meters will no longer require a full planning permission process. This change, which takes effect from April, follows similar rules that have been in place in England and Scotland since 2013. The new regulations are aimed at making it easier and quicker for mobile network operators to install and upgrade mobile masts. The streamlined planning process is expected to reduce the time and cost involved in obtaining planning permission, enabling network providers to improve coverage and capacity in areas where it is most needed. Under the new rules, masts up to 25 meters in height will be considered as permitted development, meaning that they will not need to go through a lengthy planning application process. Instead, they will only need to give notice to the local planning authority and meet certain conditions, such as being located a minimum distance from residential properties and protected areas. The changes come as part of the UK's efforts to improve mobile coverage and connectivity, particularly in rural areas where signal strength can be poor or non-existent. In Wales, the new regulations are expected to help improve coverage in some of the most remote and hard-to-reach locations, ensuring that residents and businesses have access to reliable mobile services. Welsh Government Minister for Economy and Transport, Ken Skates, said: ""These changes will help to reduce the time and cost involved in installing and upgrading mobile masts, ensuring that network providers can improve coverage and capacity in areas where it is most needed. This is an important step in our efforts to improve mobile connectivity across Wales, particularly in rural areas where signal strength can be a problem."" Mobile network operators have welcomed the news, with Vodafone UK's Director of Network and IT, Scott Petty, saying: ""These changes will make it easier and quicker for us to install and upgrade mobile masts in Wales. This will help us to improve coverage and capacity in areas where it is most needed, ensuring that our customers have access to the best possible mobile services."" However, the changes have also raised concerns among some local residents and environmental groups, who fear that the relaxation of planning rules could lead to an increase in the number of mobile masts being installed and the potential impact on visual amenity and the environment. The Welsh Government has stressed that the new regulations will still require masts to meet certain conditions and that local planning authorities will have the power to refuse permission if they believe that the proposed mast would have an unacceptable impact on the local area. Despite these concerns, the Welsh Government is confident that the new regulations will help to improve mobile coverage across Wales and bring it in line with the rest of the UK, ensuring that residents and businesses have access to reliable mobile services no matter where they are located.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Steve Easterbrook's new McJob,"By Jamie Robertson, Presenter, BBC World News The former Watford Grammar School boy, Steve Easterbrook, is making a shocking return to McDonald's, not as the CEO he once was, but in a more humble capacity. Easterbrook, who led McDonald's through a period of significant growth and revitalised the group's UK business, is taking on a new role as a Crew Member in one of the chain's restaurants. McDonald's needs a turnaround specialist more than ever. The fast-food giant has reported its first global sales decline in over a decade, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only added to its woes. With restaurant closures and disrupted supply chains, McDonald's has had to adapt quickly to survive. Easterbrook's decision to take on a McJob is not without its symbolism. The former CEO, who earned a reported Â£13.7 million in 2019, is demonstrating a commitment to understanding the challenges faced by McDonald's frontline workers. He will be working alongside them, serving customers, preparing food and cleaning the restaurant. Easterbrook's new role comes as part of McDonald's global McJob programme. The initiative, which sees executives take on entry-level roles, aims to improve communication between corporate offices and restaurants, as well as boost morale among staff. McDonald's UK & Ireland CEO, Paul Pomroy, welcomed the news, saying, ""Steve's decision to join our crew as part of our McJob programme is a fantastic gesture and a reminder of the importance of our people and the vital role they play in delivering great experiences for our customers."" Easterbrook's new role has been met with a mixed response. Some see it as a positive move, demonstrating a commitment to understanding the challenges faced by McDonald's frontline workers. Others, however, have raised questions about the value of such a high-profile executive taking on a low-paying role. Despite the controversy, Easterbrook remains undeterred. He is expected to start his new role in the coming weeks and has expressed his excitement at the opportunity to work alongside McDonald's crew members and learn from them. Easterbrook's new McJob is a reminder of the importance of grassroots experience and the value of understanding the challenges faced by frontline workers. As McDonald's continues to navigate the challenges of the pandemic, Easterbrook's insights and experiences could prove invaluable. In an interview with BBC World News, Easterbrook said, ""I'm looking forward to getting back to basics and learning from the team. I believe that by working alongside our crew members, I can gain a unique perspective and contribute to the ongoing success of McDonald's.""

Church of England to keep Amazon shares despite Welby criticism,"The Church Times has revealed that Amazon was among the 20 biggest global investments by the Church of England (CofE) last year, amounting to around Â£5 million worth of shares. This disclosure comes after criticism from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who expressed concerns over the ethical implications of investing in the tech giant. Despite this, the CofE has defended its decision to continue holding Amazon shares, stating that it considers the most effective way to seek change is to engage with companies directly. A spokesperson for the Church explained, ""We believe that as an investor, we have a responsibility to use our voice to encourage companies to act in a responsible and ethical manner. By engaging with them, we can encourage them to improve their practices and make a positive impact on society."" The Church has a long history of ethical investing and has previously sold stakes in companies such as tobacco firms and arms manufacturers due to moral objections. However, in the case of Amazon, the Church believes that engagement is the best approach. Archbishop Welby had raised concerns over Amazon's treatment of workers, particularly in relation to wages and working conditions. He also criticized the company's tax practices and its impact on the high street. In response, the Church stated that it had been in dialogue with Amazon on these issues and planned to continue engaging with the company. The Church's investment in Amazon is managed by the Church Commissioners, who oversee the investment of the Church's assets. The Commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that the Church's investments are consistent with its ethical principles. In a statement, they said, ""We take seriously our role as stewards of the Church's assets and engage with companies on a range of issues, including labour practices, tax transparency, and environmental sustainability."" The Church's approach to ethical investing is not unique. Many institutional investors, including pension funds and endowments, use similar strategies to engage with companies and encourage them to adopt more responsible practices. The Church's decision to hold onto Amazon shares is a reflection of this approach and demonstrates its commitment to using its influence to make a positive impact on society. The Church's engagement with Amazon is ongoing, and it is unclear at this stage what specific actions the company may take in response to the Church's concerns. However, the Church remains hopeful that through dialogue and engagement, it can help bring about positive change. The Church's investment in Amazon is a complex issue, with ethical considerations on both sides. While some may argue that the Church should divest from the company due to its moral objections, others believe that engagement is the most effective way to bring about change. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the Church is committed to using its influence to make a positive impact on society and to hold companies accountable for their actions.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK unemployment rises to 1.7m,"That is the first increase since the May-July period of last year. The unemployment rate remained at 5.1%, which is still down on the same time last year, when it was 5.6%. Earnings, including bonuses, rose by 1.8% in the three months to February, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure is an improvement on the 1.4% increase seen in the previous quarter. However, the jobs market has shown signs of cooling down in recent months. The number of unemployed people in the UK has risen by 52,000 compared to the previous quarter, bringing the total to 1.7 million. This rise marks the first increase in unemployment since the May-July period of last year. The increase in unemployment was driven by a decrease in full-time employment. Part-time employment remained broadly unchanged, while the number of people in self-employment also fell slightly. The sectors that saw the largest decrease in employment were construction and wholesale and retail trade. Despite the rise in unemployment, the overall employment rate remained high at 75.7%. This figure is up from 75.2% in the same quarter last year. The ONS statistics also showed that the number of people in economic inactivity, which includes those not in work and not actively seeking employment, fell by 72,000 to 8.56 million. The ONS also released figures on average weekly earnings, which showed that earnings growth continued to lag behind inflation. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), stood at 1.8% in February, which was slightly above the 1.6% seen in the previous month. This means that in real terms, wages are falling, putting further pressure on households' budgets. The ONS statistics came as the Bank of England (BoE) warned that the UK economy was facing a ""challenging"" period ahead. The BoE cut its growth forecast for the UK economy this year from 1.4% to 1.1%, citing increased uncertainty due to Brexit. The rise in unemployment and slow wage growth are likely to put further pressure on the government to take action to support the jobs market and boost economic growth. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has already announced a number of measures in his budget earlier this month, including a cut in Stamp Duty Land Tax and an increase in the National Living Wage. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to offset the challenges facing the UK economy. In conclusion, the latest ONS employment statistics showed that the UK jobs market has cooled down in recent months, with the number of unemployed people rising for the first time since last year. Despite a high employment rate, wage growth remains slow and unemployment is now on the rise, adding to the challenges facing the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Speeding drink-driver killed man in Aberdeen bus stop crash,"Martin Henderson, 30, showed no remorse as he fled the scene after the crash that took the life of Allan Forbes, a father-of-three, at a bus stop in Aberdeen last year. The tragic incident occurred in the Bucksburn area, where an 18-year-old woman, unharmed but shaken, was also standing at the bus shelter. The impact of the collision was significant, with the vehicle involved coming to a halt only after striking a lamppost and compressing a wheelie bin. Witnesses at the scene described the scene as chaotic, with the sound of crunching metal and shattered glass filling the air. Emergency services were quickly called to the scene, and upon their arrival, they found Mr. Forbes lying motionless on the ground, suffering from severe injuries. Despite their best efforts, the elderly man could not be revived, and he was later pronounced dead at the scene. Henderson, who was arrested a short distance away from the crash site, initially denied being the driver of the vehicle but later confessed to the police. He was found to be over the legal limit for alcohol consumption and was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Family and friends of Allan Forbes were left devastated by the news of his death. Mr. Forbes, who was described as a kind and gentle man, had retired only a few years prior to the incident and had been looking forward to spending more time with his family. The loss of Mr. Forbes was felt deeply within the community, with many expressing their condolences and shock at the senseless tragedy. A local resident, who had known Mr. Forbes for over 20 years, described him as a ""pillar of the community"" and someone who always had a smile on his face. The investigation into the crash continued, with the police appealing for any witnesses to come forward with information. Henderson was remanded in custody and was due to appear in court to face the charge of causing death by dangerous driving. As the community mourned the loss of a beloved member, the incident served as a stark reminder of the dangers of drink-driving and the devastating consequences it can have on innocent lives. The family and friends of Allan Forbes were left to pick up the pieces, struggling to come to terms with the fact that a life had been taken needlessly.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Manchester Arena Inquiry: Area where Abedi hid 'not our domain',"Manchester Arena Inquiry: Area where Abedi Hid Not Our Domain, Testifies Security Supervisor Showsec supervisor David Middleton, who was on duty the night of the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, testified in the ongoing public inquiry that he had never been instructed to check the mezzanine area, where suicide bomber Salman Abedi hid before detonating his device. Middleton, who was in charge of the security team on that fateful evening, stated that the team's remit was to ensure the safety of the crowd as they entered and exited the arena. He explained that while they were responsible for keeping the steps clear, the area above the steps was ""not our domain."" ""We were to keep the steps clear but above the steps was not our domain,"" Middleton said during his testimony. ""We weren't supposed to venture up there, and I can't recall ever seeing anyone from our team up there during my shifts."" The inquiry, which aims to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the bombing that killed 22 people and injured hundreds more, has been hearing evidence from a range of witnesses, including emergency services personnel, security staff, and witnesses who were at the arena that night. Middleton's testimony shed new light on the events leading up to the bombing. He described how the arena was packed that night, with around 20,000 people attending Ariana Grande's concert. He recalled that there were no issues with the crowd as they arrived and entered the arena. However, Middleton's attention was drawn to the mezzanine area around 10.30 pm when he saw a man, later identified as Abedi, acting suspiciously. He described how Abedi seemed to be pacing back and forth, looking at his phone and glancing around the area. Middleton approached Abedi to ask him to move along, but the bomber ignored him and continued his suspicious behavior. Middleton then contacted his supervisor to report his concerns, but by the time backup arrived, Abedi had already left the area and detonated his device outside the arena. The inquiry is expected to continue for several more weeks as it hears evidence from a range of witnesses, including survivors of the bombing and experts in fields such as forensics, engineering, and intelligence. The final report of the inquiry is expected to be published in the fall of 2022. Middleton's testimony underscored the challenges facing security personnel at large events, particularly in identifying and dealing with potential threats in a crowd of thousands of people. It also highlighted the need for clear communication and coordination between different teams and agencies involved in ensuring public safety.

Sturgeon wants Indyref2 in 'second half of 2020',"Speaking in Dublin at the Fianna FÃ¡il Ard Fheis, Ms Sturgeon reiterated her call for a second Scottish independence referendum (Indyref2) and indicated that the ""latter half"" of next year would be the ""right time"" for such a poll. The SNP leader, who has previously stated that she would prefer to hold the referendum before the end of 2020, appeared to soften her stance, acknowledging that the timeline may not be feasible given the current political climate. Ms Sturgeon predicted victory in a second Scottish independence referendum, expressing confidence in the SNP's ability to rally the Scottish electorate behind the cause of independence once again. She argued that the Scottish people had been denied their right to self-determination following the 2014 referendum, which saw Scotland reject the Union with England and Wales by a narrow margin. The Scottish First Minister criticised the UK government's stance on the issue, accusing Boris Johnson of ""dragging his heels"" on granting Scotland a Section 30 order â the mechanism for allowing a devolved administration to hold a referendum within the terms of the Scotland Act. Ms Sturgeon emphasised the importance of Scotland's democratic institutions and argued that the people of Scotland had the right to decide their own future. Ms Sturgeon also addressed the potential impact of Brexit on Scotland, expressing concern over the potential economic and social consequences of leaving the European Union. She argued that Scotland would be better served by remaining a member of the EU, and that a second Scottish independence referendum would provide an opportunity for Scotland to choose its own European future. The SNP leader's comments come as tensions between the Scottish and UK governments continue to rise over the issue of Scottish independence. The UK government has consistently rejected Ms Sturgeon's calls for a referendum, arguing that the 2014 vote was a ""once-in-a-generation"" event and that Scotland had rejected the Union. Ms Sturgeon's decision to set a timeline for a second Scottish independence referendum is a significant development in the ongoing debate over Scotland's constitutional future. It is likely to further fuel tensions between the Scottish and UK governments and could potentially lead to a constitutional crisis if the UK government refuses to grant Scotland a Section 30 order. Despite these challenges, Ms Sturgeon remains committed to her vision of an independent Scotland and appears determined to press ahead with her plans for a second referendum. The coming months are likely to see an intensification of the debate over Scottish independence, with both sides gearing up for a bitter political battle. The outcome of this struggle could have significant implications not only for Scotland but for the future of the UK as a whole.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Iraq Inquiry: PM urged to 'pull plug' on report,"In the hallowed chambers of the House of Lords, Lord Morris, a respected figure with a long and distinguished political career, voiced his concerns over the ongoing inquiry into the UK's involvement in the 2003 Iraq conflict. Speaking before peers, the crossbencher expressed his frustration with the seemingly interminable process, stating that the panel led by Sir John Chilcot appeared ""incapable"" of delivering its report. Lord Morris's remarks came in the wake of Prime Minister David Cameron's statement that he was ""fast losing patience"" with the inquiry, which was established in 2009 to examine the decision-making process that led to the invasion of Iraq and the role the UK played in the post-conflict reconstruction. The inquiry, which has encountered numerous delays and setbacks, has been the subject of much criticism in recent times, with some commentators questioning its relevance and others bemoaning its slow pace. Lord Morris's call for the inquiry to be discharged is likely to add fuel to this growing sense of disillusionment. In response to Lord Morris's comments, a Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister believed it was ""essential that the inquiry is allowed to complete its work in order to provide a full and comprehensive account of what happened."" However, the spokesperson did not rule out the possibility of taking action if the report was not delivered in a timely manner. The opposition parties, who have long criticised the government's handling of the inquiry, seized on Lord Morris's remarks as evidence of the prime minister's growing frustration. Labour Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander accused the government of ""mismanaging the inquiry from the start,"" while the Liberal Democrats called for the prime minister to set a deadline for the report's delivery. The developments in the House of Lords come as the inquiry prepares to publish its interim report, which is expected to focus on the build-up to the war and the decision-making process leading up to the invasion. However, the final report, which is expected to cover the post-conflict reconstruction and the role of British troops in Iraq, is still some way off. As the debate over the future of the inquiry rages on, many are left wondering whether the report will ever see the light of day, or whether it will become yet another example of the UK's inability to learn from its past mistakes. Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear: the ongoing saga of the Iraq inquiry is set to continue, with no end in sight.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Why are young Indians killing themselves?,"Soutik Biswas, Delhi correspondent If new research is to be believed, a disturbingly high number of young Indians are losing the courage to live. A study published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal this month revealed that suicide rates among Indians aged between 15 and 29 have risen by 32% in the past decade. This is the highest increase in any country during this period, making India the new suicide capital for young people. The report, which was based on data collected between 2002 and 2015, found that India's suicide rate for young people had surpassed those of China, the US, and Russia. The reasons behind this alarming trend are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the socio-economic realities of contemporary India. Firstly, there is the issue of mental health. More than half of India's population lives in rural areas where access to mental health services is limited. Even in urban areas, the stigma associated with mental illness prevents many from seeking help. The lack of affordable and accessible mental health services, coupled with societal pressures, leaves many young people feeling isolated and hopeless. Secondly, there are the economic pressures. India's youth unemployment rate is currently at an all-time high of 18.7%. For those who do manage to find jobs, the wages are often meagre, leaving many struggling to make ends meet. In a country where success is often measured by material possessions, failure to keep up with these expectations can lead to feelings of shame and despair. Thirdly, there is the issue of social pressures. India's rigid social structures, traditional values, and the pressure to conform can leave young people feeling trapped and suffocated. The expectations placed on them, especially in areas such as education and marriage, can be overwhelming. Failure to meet these expectations can lead to feelings of inadequacy, and in some cases, suicide. Finally, there is the issue of substance abuse. Alcohol and drug abuse are on the rise among young people in India, with the number of users increasing by 30% between 2001 and 2016. Substance abuse can lead to a range of health problems, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and has pledged to take action. In 2016, it launched the National Mental Health Care Act, which aims to provide affordable and accessible mental health services to all. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of this crisis. The issue of young Indians taking their own lives is not a new one. However, the scale of the problem has reached crisis proportions, and urgent action is needed to address it. As a society, we need to start having open and honest conversations about mental health, challenge the stigma associated with it, and provide young people with",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bulgarian writer wins BBC Short Story Award,"The winner was announced at a ceremony in London, broadcast live on Radio 4 arts show Front Row. Penkov takes the Â£15,000 prize, while the runner-up, South African writer Henrietta Rose-Innes, wins Â£2,500 for her poignant story of love and loss. But the real spotlight was on the Bulgarian author, Ivan Penkov, who became the first Bulgarian writer to win the prestigious BBC Short Story Award. Penkov, a 34-year-old Bulgarian national, was visibly moved as he accepted the award. His story, titled ""The Woodcarver's Daughter,"" explored themes of identity and belonging, set against the backdrop of Bulgaria's complex history and cultural heritage. The judges, chaired by novelist and short story writer Bernardine Evaristo, praised Penkov's masterful storytelling and the depth of emotion he brought to the page. ""I am deeply humbled and grateful for this recognition,"" Penkov said in his acceptance speech. ""Writing is my passion, and to have my work celebrated on an international stage like this is a dream come true."" Born in the small town of Yambol, Bulgaria, Penkov grew up surrounded by the rich history of his country. He studied literature at Sofia University and later earned a Master's degree from Oxford University in the UK. His writing has been published in various literary journals and anthologies, but it was his entry into the BBC Short Story Award that brought him international acclaim. Penkov's win is a significant moment not just for him, but also for Bulgarian literature. ""Bulgarian writers have long been overlooked in the international literary scene,"" said Evaristo. ""Penkov's win is a reminder of the depth and richness of Bulgarian stories and voices."" The ceremony was attended by a host of literary luminaries, including former winners of the award, literary agents, and publishers. Penkov's win is expected to open doors for him in the world of publishing and beyond. ""I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead,"" Penkov said. ""I hope to continue writing stories that resonate with people, regardless of where they come from or what language they speak."" As Penkov leaves London with his newfound fame and the Â£15,000 prize, he remains grounded in his passion for storytelling. ""I am just a storyteller,"" he said. ""I hope my stories bring joy, comfort, or even a moment of reflection to those who read them.""

"Volkswagen's UK sales fell in October, says SMMT","The motor group has been embroiled in controversy over the past few years regarding the emissions levels of its diesel and petrol cars. The scandal, known as 'Dieselgate', came to light in 2015 when it was revealed that Volkswagen (VW) had installed software in their vehicles to cheat emissions tests. Since then, the company has faced numerous investigations, lawsuits, and penalties. Despite the ongoing controversy, Volkswagen UK reported a decline in sales for October, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Sales of VW branded cars fell by 9.8%, marking a significant decrease compared to the same period last year. The sister brands, Skoda and Seat, also experienced sales drops, with Skoda reporting a 3% decline and Seat sales sinking by 32.2%. The sales figures for October do not paint the whole picture, however. Volkswagen Group UK's managing director, Andrew Savage, stated that the decline in sales was due to a deliberate decision to reduce the number of cars sold, rather than a loss of consumer confidence. Savage added that they had been taking steps to address the issue of excess inventory, which had been building up since the start of the year. The controversy surrounding Volkswagen's emissions scandal has had a ripple effect throughout the industry, with many consumers wary of diesel cars in particular. The UK government has also introduced stricter emissions regulations, including the introduction of the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) in London. These factors have led to a shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles, with sales in this sector growing rapidly. Volkswagen has been working to restore consumer trust and has introduced several new electric and hybrid models, including the ID.3 hatchback and the ID.4 SUV. These vehicles have received positive reviews and are seen as a step in the right direction for the company. However, it will take some time for Volkswagen to fully recover from the scandal and regain its market share. In the meantime, Volkswagen UK is focusing on improving customer satisfaction and providing better aftersales service. Savage stated that they were investing in training and development for their dealers, as well as offering more flexible finance options to help customers upgrade to newer, cleaner vehicles. Despite the challenges, Volkswagen remains optimistic about the future. Savage believes that the company will bounce back, thanks to its strong brand and the increasing demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. He stated that they were committed to delivering high-quality products and services to their customers and were confident that they would continue to do so in the years to come. In conclusion, Volkswagen's sales figures for October showed a decline, with VW, Skoda, and Seat all experiencing drops.

Dashcam footage submission website goes live,"The website, which has been in development for several months, marks a significant shift in the way that dashcam footage is handled by law enforcement agencies in the UK. Previously, submitting footage to the police could be a lengthy and often frustrating process, with no guarantee of a response or even that the footage would be viewed. Now, with the new website, visitors can upload their dashcam footage directly to the site before it is automatically routed to the relevant police force based on the location of the incident. This not only saves time for both the public and the police but also ensures that important evidence is not lost or overlooked. The website, which is free to use, is easy to navigate and user-friendly. Visitors simply need to provide some basic information about the incident, including the date, time, and location, before uploading their footage. The site accepts a range of file types, including MP4 and AVI, and there is no limit to the size of the files that can be submitted. Once the footage has been uploaded, the site will automatically identify the location of the incident and send it to the appropriate police force. The site also provides users with a confirmation of receipt and an estimated time for when they can expect a response from the police. In addition to making it easier to submit dashcam footage, the website also includes a feature that allows visitors to search for other incidents that have been reported in their area. This could be particularly useful for those who have been involved in a road traffic incident or have witnessed a crime. The website has been welcomed by both the public and the police, with many seeing it as a valuable tool for improving road safety and reducing crime. The National Police Chiefs' Council has also praised the new site, describing it as a ""major step forward"" in the way that dashcam footage is handled. However, the new website has also raised concerns about data privacy and security. The site assures users that their personal information will be kept confidential and that their footage will only be accessed by authorised personnel. The site also uses encryption to ensure that the footage is secure during transmission and storage. The launch of the new dashcam footage submission website is just the latest example of how technology is being used to improve the way that the police work and interact with the public. With more and more people using dashcams while driving, it is important that there is a straightforward and efficient way to submit and process this footage. The new website is a significant step in the right direction and is sure to make a positive impact on policing in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
India raises withdrawal limit as rupee anger mounts,"In a bid to quell growing unrest over the country's cash crunch, India's finance ministry announced an increase in the daily withdrawal limit from cash machines effective immediately. The new limit allows customers to withdraw up to 2,500 rupees (approximately $34) per day, a rise from the previous limit of 2,000 rupees. Many Indians have been left frustrated and anxious as they have struggled to access their own money amidst a severe shortage of cash. Long queues have formed outside banks and ATMs as people try to withdraw their savings, often returning home empty-handed due to the daily withdrawal limit being reached. The cash crunch, which was triggered by the sudden demonetisation of high-value banknotes in November 2016, has shown no signs of abating. The government's decision to scrap 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, which accounted for 86% of the cash in circulation, was aimed at tackling corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency. However, it has also left millions of people without access to their own money, causing hardship for millions. The finance ministry's announcement, which was made in a statement on Thursday, is expected to provide some relief to those affected by the cash shortage. However, it remains to be seen whether the increase in the daily withdrawal limit will be enough to appease the growing number of frustrated customers. The cash crunch has also raised concerns about the health of India's economy, with some analysts warning of a potential recession. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, has been working to ensure that sufficient cash is available in the market. However, the introduction of new 2,000 rupee notes, which were intended to alleviate the shortage, has been slow to materialise. Meanwhile, the Indian government has promised to speed up the production and distribution of the new notes. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also urged people to use digital payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, and mobile wallets, to reduce their reliance on cash. Despite these efforts, the cash crunch shows no signs of easing, with many people continuing to face difficulties in accessing their own money. It remains to be seen whether the increase in the daily withdrawal limit will be enough to quell the growing unrest, or whether more drastic measures will be needed to address the root causes of the cash shortage.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Objective reality exists, says UK minister Matt Hancock","By Brian Wheeler Political reporter Matt Hancock acknowledged the need to reaffirm the existence of objective reality during an interview with the BBC. In a world increasingly influenced by subjective experiences and alternative facts, the UK Minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport considered it a disappointment that such a statement was necessary. ""Objective reality exists, and it's something that I think we all take for granted. It's incredibly important that we hang on to that,"" Hancock said, stressing the significance of facts and evidence in our society. The topic arose during a discussion about misinformation, fake news, and the role of technology in shaping public opinion. Hancock expressed concern over the potential for these issues to undermine the foundations of democracy and the importance of shared facts. ""We live in a world where information is so readily available, and it can be manipulated in ways that we've never seen before. It's crucial that we maintain the integrity of the information that we consume and share,"" he emphasized. The minister pointed to the power of technology platforms in disseminating information, noting their responsibility in addressing the challenges posed by misinformation and ensuring the public has access to reliable sources. He welcomed recent efforts by social media companies to address these issues, but warned that more needed to be done. ""Social media platforms have a significant role to play in this. They have the power to amplify voices and ideas, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the information they're promoting is accurate and reliable,"" Hancock said. ""We're working closely with these companies to encourage them to do more, to be more transparent about how they moderate content, and to take a more proactive approach to tackling misinformation."" Despite the challenges, Hancock expressed optimism about the future, stating that the shared understanding of objective reality would ultimately prevail. He encouraged individuals to be vigilant and critical consumers of information, and to fact-check before sharing content online. ""We need to remember that the truth will out. The facts will always prevail. It's up to each and every one of us to ensure that we're consuming and sharing accurate information,"" he concluded.

Tunisia attack: Sousse killer Rezgui 'trained in Libya',"A senior official at the Tunisian interior ministry told the Associated Press that Seifeddine Rezgui, the gunman who killed 38 people in the tourist resort of Sousse on Friday, had been in Libya in January. This revelation comes as investigators continue to piece together the details of the deadly attack, which unfolded when Rezgui opened fire on a group of sunbathers at a beachfront hotel. Two other militants, who attacked the Bardo National Museum in Tunis earlier this year, were also reported to have been in Libya around the same time as Rezgui. This connection raises the possibility that the three individuals may have been part of the same cell or that they were trained by the same militant group. Libya, which has been mired in chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, has become a breeding ground for extremist groups, including the Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The country's porous borders and weak security forces have made it easy for militants to cross into neighboring countries, including Tunisia, which has been struggling to contain the spread of terrorism. The Tunisian interior ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Rezgui had traveled to Libya via the coastal city of Ben Guerdan, which is located near the border with Tunisia. He added that Rezgui had spent several weeks in Libya before returning to Tunisia in February. During his time in Libya, Rezgui is believed to have received military training from militant groups, according to the official. This training would have equipped him with the skills and weapons needed to carry out the attack in Sousse. The attack on the beach in Sousse came just days after Tunisia's president, Beji Caid Essebsi, declared a state of emergency in the country following the Bardo museum attack, which left 21 people dead. The state of emergency gives the security forces increased powers to search homes, arrest suspects, and restrict movement. The attacks in Tunisia have dealt a significant blow to the country's tourism industry, which accounts for around 15% of the economy. The sector has already been struggling due to the political instability in the region and the threat of terrorism. The attacks have led many European countries to advise their citizens against traveling to Tunisia, causing cancellations and bookings to plummet. The Tunisian government has pledged to take action to address the root causes of terrorism, including poverty, unemployment, and political instability. It has also announced plans to increase security measures at tourist sites and strengthen cooperation with neighboring countries to prevent militants from crossing the borders.

The new prison, which will have a capacity to house up to 2,100 inmates, is part of the government's commitment to increase prison capacity and reduce reoffending rates. The facility will include educational and vocational training facilities, as well as healthcare and mental health services. The construction of the new prison is expected to create around 1,500 jobs during the building phase and a further 300 jobs once the prison is operational. Lend Lease has pledged to work with local schools and colleges to provide training and apprenticeships for young people in the area. The Prisons Minister also highlighted the importance of the project in improving the local infrastructure, with the new prison set to include a new access road, a new bridge over the River Dee, and upgrades to the local railway station. The construction of the new prison has been met with some controversy, with local residents and campaign groups raising concerns about the impact on the community and the environment. However, the government has stressed the importance of the project in addressing the current prison overcrowding crisis and reducing reoffending rates. Lend Lease has a strong track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure projects, having previously worked on projects such as the Olympic Park in London and the redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station. The company has also committed to working with the local community to ensure that the construction process runs smoothly and that any disruption is minimized. The new prison is due to open in 2023 and will be operated by the private company, Serco. The government has previously come under fire for its use of private companies to run prisons, with concerns over issues such as safety, staffing levels, and the treatment of inmates. However, the government has argued that the use of private companies can lead to cost savings and improved efficiency. Despite the controversy surrounding the project, the announcement of Lend Lease as the preferred bidder was welcomed by many in the local community, who see the new prison as an opportunity to create jobs and improve the local infrastructure. The Prisons Minister also reiterated his commitment to working with the local community to ensure that the project is delivered in a way that benefits everyone. In conclusion, the announcement of Lend Lease as the preferred bidder to build the new super-prison in Wrexham is seen as a significant development in the government's plan to increase prison capacity and reduce reoffending rates. While the project has been met with some controversy, the creation of jobs and the improvement of local infrastructure are seen as positive outcomes for the local community.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Record high child mental health waiting numbers in Scotland,"At the end of December, there were 10,820 young people waiting to start treatment at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Scotland, a figure that represents a significant increase compared to the same period the previous year. This number, which is the highest on record, equates to an average wait of 18 weeks for treatment, a waiting list that continues to grow despite efforts to reduce it. The Scottish Government has acknowledged the issue, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf stating that the ""rising demand for CAMHS services is a challenge faced by many health systems across the UK and beyond"". However, he also emphasized that ""there is no room for complacency and we must continue to do all we can to improve the situation"". The reasons for the increase in demand for mental health services among young people are complex and multifaceted. Some factors include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to social isolation, disrupted education, and increased stress and anxiety for many young people. Additionally, there is a growing awareness of mental health issues and a reduction in the stigma surrounding seeking help, leading to more young people coming forward for treatment. The longer wait times for treatment can have a detrimental impact on young people's mental health and wellbeing. Mental health conditions, if left untreated, can lead to further deterioration and more complex needs, making it more difficult to provide effective treatment in the future. Furthermore, the wait times can cause additional stress and anxiety for young people and their families, who may feel frustrated and helpless in the face of a system that seems unable to provide the help they need in a timely manner. To address this issue, the Scottish Government has announced a number of measures to increase capacity within CAMHS services and reduce wait times. These include recruiting additional staff, increasing investment in digital services, and expanding the use of telehealth and remote consultations. However, it is important to note that these measures will take time to implement and their impact on reducing wait times remains to be seen. In the meantime, it is crucial that resources are made available to support young people and their families during their wait for treatment. This can include providing information and resources on self-help and coping strategies, as well as offering counselling and other forms of support. Additionally, schools and colleges can play a vital role in supporting young people's mental health by providing a safe and inclusive environment, and by offering mental health education and training to staff and students. Ultimately, the rising number of young people waiting for mental health treatment in Scotland is a cause for concern and requires urgent attention. It is essential that all stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, NHS Scotland, and local authorities, work together to address the root causes of the issue and find ways to reduce wait times and improve access to mental health services for young people. The mental health and wellbeing of the next generation should be a priority, and it",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fear suppressing neurons found,"By Melissa Hogenboom, Science reporter, BBC Radio Science These inhibitory neurons, discovered in the hippocampus - a region of the brain known to play a crucial role in memory formation - ensure that a neutral memory of a context or location is not contaminated by an unpleasant event occurring at the same time or place. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, made the discovery after studying the brains of mice. They found that these neurons, specifically those containing the protein Parvalbumin, suppress the activity of neurons that form new memories. ""When you have a bad experience in a particular place, you want to remember the place itself, but not the bad experience,"" explains Dr. Kohta Xu-Wilson, lead author of the study. ""These inhibitory neurons are crucial for that because they help to filter out the unwanted memories."" The researchers used a genetic tool to selectively activate these inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus while the mice were exploring a new environment. They found that the mice formed fewer memories of the environment when these neurons were active. ""This shows that these neurons are actively suppressing the formation of new memories,"" says Dr. Xu-Wilson. The researchers then repeated the experiment, but this time they used a different genetic tool to silence the inhibitory neurons. They found that the mice formed more memories of the environment when these neurons were silent. ""This shows that these neurons are not only suppressing the formation of new memories, but they are also important for forgetting unwanted memories,"" explains Dr. Xu-Wilson. The discovery could have important implications for understanding and treating conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where unwanted memories of traumatic events can be debilitating. ""Understanding the mechanisms of fear suppression could help us develop new treatments for PTSD and other conditions where unwanted memories are a problem,"" says Dr. Xu-Wilson. The research was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The study is just the latest in a series of discoveries about the role of neurons in memory formation and suppression. Previous research has shown that other types of neurons, specifically those containing the protein NMDA, are crucial for the formation of long-term memories. ""Memory is a complex process, and it's clear that different types of neurons play different roles,"" says Dr. Xu-Wilson. ""Our discovery of these inhibitory neurons and their role in memory suppression adds to our understanding of this complex process."" The researchers are now planning further experiments to explore the mechanisms of fear suppression in more detail and to understand how these neurons interact with other types of neurons in the brain.

Global dip in renewable energy investment,"By Mark Kinver, Environment reporter, BBC News Renewable energy investment saw a global dip for the second consecutive year, according to new data, but falling costs meant the sector remained competitive despite policy uncertainty. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported a 14% decline in new investments to $260bn (Â£192bn) in 2019 compared with the previous year. Solar power saw the largest decrease in investment, down 23%, followed by wind energy, which suffered a 10% drop. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said: ""This is the second consecutive year of decline, and it's a trend that we need to reverse if we are to put the world on a credible path towards achieving long-term climate goals."" The report attributed the decline in part to cheaper renewable energy technology, but also to policy instability. In China - the world's largest investor in renewables - the government reduced subsidies for wind and solar power. Meanwhile, the US, which is the third biggest investor, saw a 62% drop in investment due to a lack of federal incentives. Despite the overall decline, the falling cost of renewable energy technologies kept them competitive with fossil fuels. According to the IEA, the cost of solar power fell by 13% last year, while wind power saw a 10% decrease, making them increasingly cost-effective. Mr Birol added: ""Renewables are becoming cheaper and cheaper, so even if the investment goes down, the absolute amount of renewable power capacity that is being added to the grid is still increasing."" The IEA said that solar and wind power accounted for around 30% of all new electricity capacity added globally last year. The agency's data also showed that private investment in renewables outpaced government investment for the first time, suggesting that the sector is becoming less reliant on subsidies. However, the report warned that investment in renewables would need to more than double by 2030 if the world was to meet its Paris Agreement targets to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The IEA said that to achieve this, there would need to be a ""step change"" in investment in renewables, along with stronger policy frameworks and market signals. Mr Birol concluded: ""We need to invest much more in renewables, and we need to invest much more in energy efficiency if we are to put the world on a sustainable energy path."" The IEA report came as the United Nations (UN) warned that the world was ""off track"" in its efforts to address the climate crisis, with the latest data showing a 2.1% increase in global carbon dioxide emissions in 2019 compared with the previous year",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
British bluebells 'have advantage over Spanish bluebells',"By Helen Briggs, BBC News The introduced Spanish variety of bluebells has lower fertility and is unlikely to wipe out the native plant, according to genetic tests. The Spanish bluebell's escape into the wild has raised concerns that the two plants could hybridise, leading to the loss of the distinctive British bluebell's unique genetic makeup. However, new research suggests that the risk of extinction for the native plant may not be as great as previously thought. A team of scientists, led by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, analysed the DNA of both the British and Spanish bluebells. They found that while the Spanish bluebells do interbreed with the native plants, the resulting offspring have lower fertility. This means that the Spanish bluebells are less likely to produce viable seeds and therefore less able to spread and dominate the population. ""Our findings suggest that the Spanish bluebell is not as much of a threat to the native bluebell as was once thought,"" said Dr. David Hodgson, one of the researchers involved in the study. The Spanish bluebell was first introduced to the UK in the late 19th century and is now found in large numbers in woodlands across southern England. It is easily distinguished from the native bluebell by its paler flowers and later blooming time. The concern was that the two varieties could hybridise, leading to the loss of the unique genetic characteristics of the native plant. This could have implications for its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and potentially put it at risk of extinction. However, the new research provides some reassurance that the native bluebell is likely to persist. The team also found evidence of genetic exchange in the opposite direction, with native bluebells interbreeding with Spanish ones. This suggests that the two populations may be able to co-exist in the long term. ""It's important to remember that hybridisation is a natural process and can lead to new and interesting genetic combinations,"" said Dr. Hodgson. ""Our findings suggest that the native bluebell has the potential to adapt to the presence of the Spanish bluebell and maintain its unique genetic identity."" The researchers hope that their findings will help to inform conservation efforts and promote the co-existence of both varieties in the UK's woodlands. They also emphasise the importance of continuing to monitor the situation closely to ensure the long-term health and survival of both the native and introduced bluebells. The team's research was published in the journal Molecular Ecology.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan,"The hurried ferry procurement process as the UK prepared to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 cost taxpayers more than Â£85m. That included Â£34m in a settlement with Seaborne Freight, a company with no prior experience in ferry operations. As the UK government seeks a new no-deal Brexit freight plan, the costly mistakes of the past continue to haunt them. The fiasco surrounding the procurement of ferry services to keep supply lines flowing in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been a source of embarrassment for the UK government. Seaborne Freight, a small company with no experience in ferry operations, was awarded a lucrative contract to operate a freight service between Ramsgate in England and Ostend in Belgium. However, it soon became clear that Seaborne Freight did not have the necessary ships to fulfill the contract. The government was forced to terminate the contract, leading to the Â£34m settlement payment. This was not the only costly mistake made during the procurement process. The Ministry of Defence spent over Â£50m on chartering ferries from various companies. Despite the previous failures, the UK government is once again looking for new ferry operators to keep supply lines moving in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Department for Transport has launched a new tender process for ferry services between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as well as between Britain and the EU. The new tender process has been criticized for being too complex and time-consuming. The deadline for applications is just three weeks away, leaving potential operators little time to prepare bids. There are also concerns about the lack of transparency in the procurement process. The government has defended the new tender process, stating that it has learned from the mistakes of the past. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said, ""We have taken on board the lessons learned from the previous procurement process and are confident that this new approach will deliver a successful outcome."" However, not everyone is convinced. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon has called on the government to be more transparent about the procurement process and to engage with the industry more effectively. ""The government needs to learn from its mistakes and ensure that this new tender process is fair, transparent and gives enough time for operators to prepare bids,"" he said. As the UK continues to navigate the complexities of Brexit, the need for a reliable and efficient freight plan is more important than ever. The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that any new procurement process is robust, transparent, and delivers value for money. Only then can the UK avoid further costly mistakes and ensure the smooth flow of goods and supplies across its borders.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sugababe changes 'hard on Amelle',"By Natalie Jamieson, Newsbeat entertainment reporter It was announced on the Sugababes' website last week that 25-year-old band member Amelle Berrabah would be taking a break from the group to focus on her mental health. The statement revealed that she would be seeking treatment at a private clinic following a diagnosis. Heidi Range, the remaining original member of the band, spoke to Newsbeat about the situation, expressing her support for Amelle and addressing the rumours that have been circulating about the group. ""Things went on a few months ago within the band that have been quite challenging for Amelle,"" Heidi explained. ""She's been struggling with her mental health, and it's something that she needs to address right now."" Heidi went on to clarify that there is no truth to the rumours of infighting or disputes within the band. ""It's not about that at all,"" she stated emphatically. ""It's about Amelle's wellbeing and her needing to take some time out to focus on herself."" The Sugababes, who have been a mainstay in the music industry since their formation in 1998, have faced their fair share of challenges over the years. Their line-up has undergone numerous changes, with Amelle joining the group in 2001 following the departure of Mutya Buena and Siobhan Donaghy. Despite the upheaval, the band has continued to release successful albums and singles, with their most recent release, ""He's Got It Back,"" featuring Amelle prominently. However, it seems that the pressures of the music industry have taken a toll on the singer. In a statement on the band's website, Amelle thanked her fans for their support and emphasized that she would be taking this time to prioritize her mental health. ""I want to thank all the fans for their continuous love and support,"" she wrote. ""I'm taking some time out to focus on my wellbeing and I will be back soon."" Heidi reiterated the importance of this time for Amelle, stating that the entire group was behind her. ""We all love and support Amelle, and we just want her to get better,"" she said. ""We'll all be here waiting for her when she's ready to return."" As the Sugababes continue to navigate this challenge, they join a growing list of artists who have spoken openly about the importance of mental health and the need to prioritize self-care in the face of the demands of the music industry.

Carney says house price boom is 'manageable',"Carney's Assurance on Manageable House Price Boom: A Graduated Approach from the Bank of England He told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee that the Bank of England is acting in a ""graduated and proportionate way"" to prevent the housing market from spiraling out of control, despite the recent surge in house prices. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, sought to allay concerns about the sustainability of the current housing market conditions during his testimony before the House of Lords committee. Carney emphasized that the Bank has implemented a range of measures to keep the housing market in check, starting with the announcement of the Additional Prudential Requirements (APR) in December 2013. This measure, designed to strengthen banks' capital positions, was intended to encourage lenders to reduce their lending to riskier borrowers, thus minimizing the potential for a housing market bubble. Furthermore, the Bank of England raised the base rate of interest by 0.5% in August 2016, the first rate hike since 2007, in order to curb inflation and prevent excessive borrowing. Carney explained that this increase, although modest, would contribute to a more even economic recovery, as well as help maintain the stability of the housing market. In response to a question about the potential for further interest rate hikes, Carney stated that the Bank would continue to monitor economic conditions closely and adjust its monetary policy accordingly. However, he emphasized that the Bank was not ""wedded to a particular path"" and that its primary goal was to maintain a stable economy. Carney acknowledged that there were risks associated with the current housing market, including the potential for a correction in house prices. However, he expressed confidence that the Bank's measures, combined with the government's initiatives, such as the Help to Buy scheme, would help keep the housing market stable. He also stressed the importance of addressing the underlying causes of the housing market's resurgence, including the shortage of new homes and the lack of affordable housing for first-time buyers. Carney encouraged the government to take a long-term approach to addressing these issues and to invest in infrastructure projects that would stimulate economic growth and create new housing opportunities. In conclusion, Carney's testimony before the Lords Economic Affairs Committee provided reassurance that the Bank of England is taking a measured and prudent approach to managing the current housing market boom. While acknowledging the risks, he expressed confidence that the Bank's actions, along with those of the government, would help maintain a stable housing market and support the broader economic recovery.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Asbestos: Cwmcarn High School could reopen after scare,"Executive welcomed the latest assessment from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which found that the levels of asbestos fibres in the air at Cwmcarn High School in Caerphilly county were below the permitted limit. The school, which closed in October following an initial report of asbestos contamination, could now reopen, subject to further tests and clearance from the HSE. The school's headteacher, Mr. Jones, expressed relief and appreciation for the swift action taken by the HSE. He assured parents and students that the safety and wellbeing of the school community remained the top priority. ""We are delighted that the Health and Safety Executive has carried out this thorough assessment and found that the school is safe for occupation,"" Mr. Jones stated. ""We understand the concerns raised by the initial report, and we have worked closely with the HSE to ensure that all necessary steps have been taken to address the issue."" The initial report, which identified asbestos in the school's roof and pipe insulation, sparked a wave of anxiety among parents and students alike. The school swiftly closed its doors and initiated a full investigation, with the HSE taking the lead on the assessment. The latest assessment involved air testing, as well as visual inspections of the areas identified in the initial report. The HSE confirmed that the school environment was safe for re-entry, but further tests would be required to ensure ongoing compliance with regulations. Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral, was extensively used in construction until the 1970s due to its insulating and fire-resistant properties. However, when asbestos fibres become airborne and are inhaled, they can cause serious health issues, including mesothelioma, a type of cancer. The discovery of asbestos in schools is not an uncommon occurrence, with thousands of buildings across the UK believed to contain the potentially hazardous material. In response, the government has pledged Â£2 billion to eradicate asbestos from schools, aiming to complete the work by 2028. Meanwhile, Cwmcarn High School will resume its operations under strict guidelines and regular inspections to ensure the ongoing safety of its students and staff. The school community can take solace in the fact that their concerns have been addressed, and the necessary steps have been taken to mitigate the risks associated with asbestos. Mr. Jones concluded, ""We would like to thank the Health and Safety Executive for their professionalism and swift action in addressing the concerns raised. We are now looking forward to welcoming our students back to the school, and we are committed to maintaining a safe and healthy learning environment for them.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
US slavery: How is America marking the 400th anniversary?,"Why is the date significant? In 1619, a ship arrived in an English settlement in what is now the US state of Virginia, carrying some 20 captured Africans. It's the first documented evidence of enslaved Africans in what would become the United States of America. This moment marks the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, a brutal and inhumane system that would last for over 200 years, shaping the country's history and the lives of millions. Four centuries have passed since that fateful arrival. Today, the United States is commemorating this solemn anniversary, reflecting on the legacy of slavery and its enduring impact on American society. The commemoration comes amidst a renewed national conversation about race, identity, and inequality. The events of the past year have brought the issue of systemic racism to the forefront of national discourse. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement have sparked widespread protests and demands for change. The 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Virginia offers an opportunity for Americans to confront the painful truths of their past and work towards a more equitable future. President Joe Biden acknowledged the significance of the anniversary in a statement. ""We must remember our history, learn from it, and confront the harms and consequences of the past,"" he said. ""We must also recognize that the legacy of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism still exists today and affects generations of Americans in ways both seen and unseen."" Various organizations and institutions are planning events and initiatives to mark the occasion. The National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is hosting a series of programs, including a symposium on the importance of remembering the transatlantic slave trade. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History will display a new exhibition, ""Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello,"" which explores the lives of enslaved people at Thomas Jefferson's Virginia plantation. The 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Virginia is a solemn reminder of the painful history of slavery in America. It is also an opportunity for the country to come together and confront the lingering effects of that history. Through education, dialogue, and action, Americans can work towards a more just and equitable society where all people are treated with dignity and respect. The commemoration of this anniversary is not just about remembering the past, but also about shaping the future. It's about recognizing the impact that slavery has had on the country and the need for ongoing efforts to address the systemic racism and inequality that persist today. It's about creating a more inclusive and equitable society where all people have the opportunity to thrive. As Americans reflect on the past",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

'Â£5m needed' to upgrade Wales' substandard state bridges,"By Nelli Bird, BBC Radio Wales News The Institution for Civil Engineers in Wales has raised concerns about the safety of 39 substandard bridges in the country, which do not meet current regulations. The structures, out of a total of 1,263, have been identified as requiring upgrade work worth an estimated Â£5m. The Institution's latest Red Book report, which assesses the condition of Wales' bridges, states that while most are in a satisfactory or good state, these 39 structures are in an unsatisfactory condition. The report specifically mentions the Genoa Bridge in Pembrokeshire as one of the most pressing cases. The Genoa Bridge, which carries the A477 over the River Genoa, has been classified as being in a ""poor"" state, with defects including corrosion to the steelwork and concrete degradation. The report warns that if no action is taken, the bridge will require major repairs or even replacement in the future. The Welsh Government has responded to the report, saying it is aware of the issues with the bridges and has ""reassured"" drivers that they are all safe to use. A spokesperson for the government said: ""We recognise the need to invest in maintaining and improving our infrastructure, and we are committed to doing so. We are currently in the process of developing a new bridge inspection regime, which will help us prioritise the necessary repairs and upgrades."" However, the Institution for Civil Engineers in Wales has called for urgent action. Its director, Fiona Howe, said: ""These substandard bridges are not just a safety concern, they are also a barrier to economic growth. By investing in their repair and upgrade, we can not only ensure the safety of road users but also improve the flow of traffic and open up new opportunities for businesses and communities."" The Institution's report also highlights the need for long-term investment in Wales' bridge network. It estimates that Â£420m is required over the next ten years to maintain and improve the country's bridges. The Institution's director of external affairs, Phil Wood, said: ""We cannot afford to wait for bridges to fail before we act. We need to invest in their maintenance and upgrade now to ensure they continue to serve the people of Wales safely and efficiently."" The Welsh Government has announced a Â£1bn infrastructure investment fund, which is expected to include funding for bridge repairs and upgrades. However, the Institution for Civil Engineers in Wales has called for a long-term commitment to infrastructure investment, beyond the next ten years. Mr Wood said: ""We need a sustainable funding model to ensure that our bridges, and other infrastructure, can meet the needs of the people of Wales now and in the future.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

All five have weathered the coronavirus storm in their own ways, and they consider themselves lucky to have made it through. Paul and Jackie were among the first in the family to fall ill. In late March, Paul began feeling unwell with a cough and a fever. Jackie followed soon after, developing similar symptoms. Keri and Chris, who work from home, took care of them, ensuring they had food and medication. Rosie, who is a key worker and continued to go to work, was extra careful to avoid bringing the virus home. Paul and Jackie's cases were mild, but they spent several weeks recovering. They were grateful for their family's support and the NHS, which provided them with regular phone consultations and prescriptions. They also appreciated the kindness of their neighbours, who dropped off groceries and other essentials. Rosie, who works in healthcare, was next to be affected. She tested positive for the virus in early May. Keri and Chris moved into her bedroom to isolate from her, while Rosie recovered in the living room. Keri and Chris used the time to help Rosie with her work, and they made sure she had everything she needed. Rosie's case was the most severe of the family's. She spent a week in bed, too tired to eat or move. Keri and Chris were worried but tried to stay positive. They watched movies, read books, and played board games to keep everyone's spirits up. As Rosie began to recover, they all breathed a sigh of relief. Chris, who had been working from home, tested positive for the virus in early June. He was the last to fall ill, and his case was mild. Keri and Rosie took care of him while Paul and Jackie continued to recover. The family's experience with coronavirus has brought them closer together. They have learned to appreciate the simple things in life, such as good health and the support of family and friends. They have also developed a newfound respect for key workers, who have continued to work throughout the pandemic to keep essential services running. As they look to the future, the family is taking things one day at a time. They continue to follow government guidelines and are cautious about going out in public. They have also made some changes to their home to make it more comfortable and accessible for Paul and Jackie, who may need extra support in the coming months.

Redcar Regent Cinema demolition inspires memory 'flood',"Redcar's Regent Cinema opened its doors as a music hall, the Pavilion, in 1928. The grand edifice on Coatham Road was a place of joy and wonder, where the community came together to be entertained. It was here that Larry Grayson, performing under the stage name Billy Breen, first coined his iconic ""shut that door"" catchphrase, which would later bring him fame on television. Decades passed, and the cinema continued to be a beloved institution, hosting various events and screening the latest films. But the passage of time took its toll, and in 2018, the Regent Cinema closed its doors for the final time. The announcement came as a shock to the local community, who had grown up with the cinema as a constant presence in their lives. As the demolition of the Regent Cinema began, a sense of nostalgia and sadness washed over the town. Memories of first dates, family outings, and childhood adventures flooded social media feeds, as residents shared stories of their experiences at the cinema. ""I remember going to the Regent Cinema with my dad when I was a kid,"" said local resident, John Smith. ""We would go and see the latest blockbusters, and I would always try to sneak in some popcorn even though my mum had told me not to. It's a shame to see it go."" The demolition process was a slow and meticulous one, with care taken to preserve any historic features that could be salvaged. The original Art Deco faÃ§ade was carefully dismantled and will be restored and displayed in a local museum. But even as the cinema was being torn down, plans for a new one were already underway. A consortium of local businesses and community groups came together to raise funds for a new cinema, which is set to open in 2023. The new Regent Cinema will be a state-of-the-art facility, with multiple screens, a cafÃ©, and a function room for community events. It will also pay homage to the history of the original cinema, with displays and memorabilia showcasing its rich past.

""The Regent Cinema has always been an important part of the community, and we're determined to create a space that will continue to inspire and entertain for generations to come."" As the demolition of the old Regent Cinema continues, the community looks forward to the opening of the new one with a sense of excitement and anticipation. It may be a new building, but it will carry the legacy of the old one, and the memories of all those who have passed through its doors.

Coronavirus: Almost 900 Manchester Airports Group job cuts,"Manchester Airports Group (MAG), the UK's largest airport operator, announced plans to cut nearly 900 jobs across its three main airports: Manchester, London Stansted, and East Midlands. The company stated that 465 roles were under threat at Manchester Airport, with 376 positions at risk at London Stansted Airport, and an additional 51 jobs on the line at East Midlands Airport. The proposed job cuts come as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the aviation industry. MAG's CEO, Charlie Cornish, acknowledged the difficult decision, saying, ""These proposals are a direct result of the prolonged and significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the wider aviation industry."" Manchester Airport, the UK's third busiest airport, has been particularly hard hit. Its passenger numbers dropped by 78% in 2020 compared to the previous year. The airport, which employs around 18,000 people, has been forced to reduce its workforce to cope with the dramatic decline in travel. MAG said it would consult with staff and unions on the proposed job cuts. London Stansted Airport, the UK's fourth busiest airport, has also seen a significant drop in passenger numbers, with a 71% decline in 2020 compared to the previous year. The airport, which employs around 12,000 people, has been hit by the collapse of several airlines and the reduction in flights as a result of the pandemic. East Midlands Airport, which is the UK's 15th busiest airport, has seen a 68% decrease in passenger numbers in 2020 compared to the previous year. The airport, which employs around 5,000 people, has been affected by the reduction in flights and the collapse of several airlines. The proposed job cuts are the latest in a series of measures taken by MAG to weather the storm caused by the pandemic. In May 2020, the company announced it was cutting the salaries of its executive team by 20% and reducing the pay of its non-executive directors by 10%. MAG also furloughed around 2,500 employees and implemented cost-saving measures. The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the aviation industry worldwide. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global airline industry could lose up to $84.3 billion in revenue in 2021. The industry body warned that the recovery in the aviation sector could take until 2024. The proposed job cuts by MAG are a stark reminder of the challenges facing the aviation industry as it tries to recover from the pandemic.

Falkirk vote-rigging claims: Jack Straw calls for new inquiry,"On BBC2's Daily Politics, the Labour MP Jack Straw called for a new inquiry into vote-rigging claims in Falkirk, stating that there was ""a sufficient case, based on the evidence that has been presented, for there to be further questions that will need to be answered."" Straw's comments come after a damning report by the Electoral Commission found that Labour's selection process in Falkirk was ""marred by a lack of transparency, bullying, and intimidation."" The report also revealed that thousands of new Labour members were registered in the constituency in the run-up to the 2010 general election, many of whom were discovered to have false addresses or were not actually living in the area. The controversy began when it emerged that union activists had been encouraged to join the Labour Party and register to vote in Falkirk, in order to help the party secure a victory in the constituency. The allegations of vote-rigging gained momentum when it was revealed that some of these new members had been registered without their consent or knowledge. The Electoral Commission's report found that Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) had ""failed to act appropriately"" in response to concerns raised about the selection process in Falkirk. The report also criticised the party for a ""lack of clarity and transparency"" in its handling of the matter. In response to the report, Labour leader Ed Miliband has apologised for any mistakes made during the selection process in Falkirk, and has promised to take action to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. However, Straw has argued that a full and independent inquiry is necessary to get to the bottom of the issue. Straw, who served as Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary under Tony Blair's Labour government, has a long history of involvement in party politics and has been a vocal critic of the current Labour leadership. He has previously called for Miliband to resign over his handling of the union issue, and has accused the party of being too close to the unions. Speaking on Daily Politics, Straw argued that the Electoral Commission report did not go far enough in addressing the issues surrounding Falkirk, and that a new inquiry was necessary to establish the full extent of the vote-rigging claims and to identify those responsible. ""The Electoral Commission report is very thorough in its analysis of what happened, but it doesn't actually draw the conclusions that I think need to be drawn,"" Straw said. ""I think there are still questions that need to be answered about who was responsible for what happened in Falkirk."" Straw also criticised the party for its handling of the issue, accusing it of trying to ""cover up"" what had happened in Falkirk and of being more concerned with protecting its own interests than with ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.

Grenfell Tower final death toll stands at 71,"The Grenfell Tower tragedy continues to unfurl its devastating impact on the lives of those affected, with the final death toll now standing at 71. The number of victims includes baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital on 14 June, the day the 24-storey blaze broke out. Grieving families and friends have been left to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones, as the full extent of the disaster becomes clearer. Among the victims were 17 children and 28 people aged over 60. The youngest victim was just seven years old, while the oldest was 82. As the investigation into the cause of the fire continues, questions are being raised about the safety measures in place at Grenfell Tower and other high-rise buildings across the UK. The exterior cladding, which has been identified as a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire, was installed as part of a Â£10m refurbishment project completed in 2016. The contractor responsible for the installation has since gone into administration, adding to the complexity of the situation. The Grenfell Tower fire has also highlighted the need for better emergency response plans and communication between emergency services and residents. Many residents reported difficulty in contacting the emergency services on the night of the fire, and some raised concerns about the initial response from the emergency services. The ongoing support for the survivors and the families of those who have lost their lives has been a beacon of hope in the midst of tragedy. Community organisations, charities, and individuals have rallied together to provide practical and emotional support to those affected. A JustGiving page set up to raise funds for the victims has surpassed Â£25m, a testament to the generosity of the public. The Grenfell Tower fire has also sparked a national conversation about social inequality and the need for affordable housing for all. The tower was home to many low-income families and refugees, and the disaster has underscored the urgent need for housing policies that ensure everyone has a safe and affordable place to live. As the investigation into the cause of the fire continues, the focus now turns to rehousing those who have been displaced and providing support for those who have been left traumatised by the events of that fateful night. The Grenfell Tower fire has left an indelible mark on the community, and the road to recovery will be long and arduous.

Syrian refugee families to be housed in Llandrindod Wells,"They would be the first Syrian refugee families to be placed in Llandrindod Wells, a picturesque town nestled in the heart of Powys, Wales. Known for its stunning natural beauty and friendly community, Llandrindod Wells was recently named the happiest place to live in Wales by the Rightmove Happy at Home Index. However, the arrival of these families was not met with universally positive reception. A report to the Powys County Council outlined concerns raised by some local residents. The small town, with a population of just over 4,000, had limited resources and infrastructure to accommodate a significant influx of newcomers. Housing was a prime concern, as there was a shortage of suitable properties for the families. Furthermore, some residents expressed fears about the impact on local services, particularly education and healthcare. The town's primary school was already at full capacity, and there were concerns about the strain on the local health centre. There were also concerns regarding potential cultural clashes and integration issues. Some residents felt that the Syrian families might find it difficult to assimilate into the local community, given the significant cultural differences. However, many other residents were keen to welcome the new arrivals with open arms. A group of local volunteers had come together to offer their support, organising a community event to help the families settle in. They had collected donations of furniture, clothing, and food, and were planning to help the families register for essential services and enroll their children in school. The town's mayor, Councillor John Davies, expressed his support for the refugees. ""Llandrindod Wells has a long and proud history of welcoming newcomers,"" he said. ""We may have concerns, but we must remember that these families have fled war and persecution, and they deserve our compassion and support. I am confident that our community will rally around them and help them to rebuild their lives."" Despite the concerns, the council pressed on with its plans to house the Syrian families in Llandrindod Wells. With the help of local volunteers and community organisations, they were determined to make the town a welcoming and supportive place for the new arrivals. As the families arrived, the community came together to show their support. Neighbours offered gifts of food and clothing, and the local school held a welcome assembly for the children. The Syrian families were grateful for the warmth and kindness shown to them, and they looked forward to beginning their new life in their adopted home. In the coming weeks and months, the community would face challenges as they worked to integrate the new families. But with the support of local residents, the council, and various community organisations, they were confident that they could create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

Leo Varadkar: Irish government wins confidence motion,"Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister), has expressed regret for his actions during a controversial incident in 2019, which led to the Irish government winning a confidence motion with the support of opposition parties. He has apologised ""for errors of judgement"" after passing a confidential agreement with one medical organisation to another rival one. The incident came to light during an investigation by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC). It was revealed that Mr Varadkar had shared a confidential memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Irish government and the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) without the IMO's consent. The MoU contained sensitive information regarding the government's plans to recruit additional doctors and nurses to address staffing shortages in the Irish health service. The IMO, which represents the majority of doctors in Ireland, was angered by the leak and accused the government of breaching trust. They threatened industrial action, which could have caused significant disruptions to the Irish health service. The controversy led to a loss of confidence in the government's ability to handle sensitive information and negotiate with medical organisations. In response, Mr Varadkar offered an apology and explained that he had shared the MoU with the INMO in good faith, believing that it would help to resolve ongoing industrial disputes between the government and the nursing and midwifery union. However, his actions were seen as a breach of trust by both the IMO and the opposition parties, who accused the government of playing one side against the other. Faced with the prospect of a no-confidence motion, Mr Varadkar worked to restore confidence in his government. He reached out to opposition parties and engaged in constructive dialogue, offering concessions and addressing their concerns. The opposition parties, recognising the need for political stability, ultimately decided to support the government in the confidence motion. The motion, which was held on [insert date], saw the Irish government win the support of a majority of parliamentarians, allowing Mr Varadkar to continue in his role as Taoiseach. In his statement to the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament), Mr Varadkar acknowledged the seriousness of the incident and pledged to learn from it, promising to be more transparent in his future dealings with medical organisations and other stakeholders. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of trust and transparency in politics, particularly when it comes to handling sensitive information. It also highlighted the need for effective communication and collaboration between different stakeholders, especially in the context of labour relations and the delivery of essential public services like healthcare. Moving forward, Mr Varadkar's government will need to work to rebuild trust with the medical organisations and the Irish public, as well as address the underlying issues that led to the staffing shortages and industrial disputes in the first place.

Female Islamic clerics in Indonesia issue rare child marriage fatwa,"The fatwa, which is not legally binding but will be influential, was issued after a three-day congress of female clerics in Indonesia, convened to discuss various issues affecting women in the Muslim-majority country. The gathering, which took place in the central Java city of Solo, brought together over 500 female ulama (clerics) from across the archipelago. One of the key resolutions passed during the congress was a strong condemnation of child marriage. The clerics urged the government to raise the minimum legal age for women to marry from the current 16 years for Muslims, which is among the lowest in the world, to 18 years. They argued that the early marriage of girls, many of whom are still children themselves, can lead to serious health and psychological problems, as well as limit their educational opportunities and hinder their personal development. The fatwa, which was signed by over 200 of the female clerics present, also called on community leaders and religious figures to promote awareness about the harmful effects of child marriage and to encourage families to delay their daughters' marriages until they are physically and emotionally ready for married life. Although Indonesia's Constitutional Court is currently considering a petition to raise the legal age for marriage to 18, the issue remains contentious, particularly in conservative communities where the practice is deeply ingrained. The latest fatwa, which is the first of its kind on this issue in the country, is expected to add weight to the campaign to end child marriage in Indonesia and inspire similar initiatives by other religious and civil society groups. ""We issued this fatwa because we believe that the health, education, and future prospects of young girls are at stake when they are forced into marriage before they are ready,"" said Sister Fatimah, one of the signatories of the fatwa and a well-known women's rights activist. ""We hope that this will be a turning point in our efforts to end child marriage in Indonesia once and for all."" The fatwa also called on the government to increase funding for education and health services, particularly in rural areas where child marriage is most prevalent, and to provide more support for women and girls who have been subjected to domestic violence or other forms of gender-based violence. The Indonesian government has yet to respond to the fatwa, but the country's top Islamic body, the Indonesian Ulama Council (MUI), has welcomed the initiative and called for more efforts to promote women's rights and empowerment in the country. ""We fully support the efforts of our female clerics to promote women's rights and to end child marriage,"" said Chairman of the MUI, Muhammad Machasin. ""We urge the government to take action on this issue and to ensure that the rights of women and girls are protected and respected.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
German nurse jailed for life for murdering patients,"The man, identified as Niels H, 38, stood before the German court with a somber expression as he began to speak. Dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit, he looked out at the judge, jury, and audience, his voice barely audible above the hushed whispers of those in attendance. ""I cannot deny the accusations against me,"" he began, his voice barely a whisper. ""I have taken the lives of my patients and attempted to do so to others. I am truly sorry for the pain and suffering I have caused."" Niels H had worked as a nurse at a hospital in the northern German city of Kiel for over a decade. He was well-liked by his colleagues and patients, known for his kind and caring demeanor. But behind this faÃ§ade, prosecutors allege, was a man capable of unspeakable acts of cruelty. According to the indictment, Niels H injected his patients with lethal doses of insulin or other medications, often while they were under sedation or otherwise unable to defend themselves. He then falsified their medical records to cover up his crimes. The first victim, a 78-year-old woman, died in 2018. Niels H was eventually suspended from his job after another colleague became suspicious of a sudden spate of patient deaths. An investigation was launched, and Niels H was eventually arrested in March 2020. Further investigations revealed that Niels H had been targeting elderly patients, some of whom were already seriously ill. Prosecutors believe he may have been motivated by a desire for control and power, or perhaps even financial gain. As the trial came to a close, the court heard harrowing testimony from family members of the victims and former colleagues of the defendant. One relative of a victim broke down in tears as she described the pain of losing her loved one at the hands of a trusted healthcare professional. The jury deliberated for just over two hours before delivering a verdict: Niels H was found guilty of two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. He was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. As he was led away in handcuffs, Niels H looked back at the courtroom one last time, his expression unreadable. The room was silent, save for the sound of sobs and gasps from those who had lost loved ones to his deceit. The search for justice, it seemed, had come to an end. But for the families and friends of the victims, the pain and suffering would continue long after the trial was over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Trump appoints China critic Peter Navarro to trade post,"He will lead the White House National Trade Council and serve as the director of trade and industrial policy, a position that places him at the center of President-elect Donald Trump's plans to renegotiate U.S.-China trade relations. Mr. Navarro, an economist and long-time China critic, advised Mr. Trump throughout his campaign and will now bring his expertise and influence to the White House. Navarro gained notoriety for his critically acclaimed books, ""The Coming China Wars: Economic, Political, and Strategic Shifts in U.S.-China Relations"" and ""Death by China: Confronting the Dragon â A Global Call to Action."" In these works, he argues that China's unfair trade practices and manipulation of its currency have had a devastating impact on the U.S. economy and American jobs. Navarro's appointment is a clear signal that the Trump administration intends to take a hard line against China, with the economist laying the groundwork for a potential trade war between the two global powers. During the campaign, Mr. Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator upon taking office, a move that could lead to retaliation from Beijing. Navarro's views on China are not without controversy. Critics argue that his analysis is overly simplistic and that he overlooks the complexities of the global economy. They also point out that his proposed solutions, such as imposing tariffs on Chinese imports, could harm American consumers and businesses. Despite these criticisms, Navarro has earned a dedicated following, particularly among those who have lost jobs due to the outsourcing of manufacturing to China. His appointment to a senior role in the Trump administration is a testament to the power of this constituency and the president-elect's commitment to addressing their concerns. As he takes up his new position in the White House, Navarro will work closely with other trade officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Together, they will shape Trump's trade policies and negotiate with trading partners around the world, with an emphasis on rebalancing the trade relationship between the U.S. and China. Navarro's appointment marks a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, moving away from the free trade orthodoxy of the past and towards a more protectionist stance. It also reflects the growing frustration among American workers and voters with globalization and the perceived loss of jobs to foreign competition. The next few years are likely to see a renewed focus on domestic industries and a more assertive stance towards China and other trading partners.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Five things Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley told Newsbeat,"By Jonathan Blake, Newsbeat politics reporter Speaking to Newsbeat at a rally in Bristol, Mr Bartley said voting for a smaller party like his ""sends a powerful message to the political establishment that people are hungry for change."" Here are five key things he had to say: 1. On the climate crisis: ""The climate crisis isn't something that's going to be solved by tinkering around the edges. We need a Green New Deal, which is a comprehensive plan to transform our economy and society to be carbon neutral, to create millions of jobs, and to address the social inequalities that are fueling the climate crisis in the first place."" 2. On working with other parties: ""We're not ideologically opposed to working with other parties. We've worked with the Labour Party in the past, we've worked with the Liberal Democrats. But we need to see a genuine commitment from them to our values and to the Green agenda. We're not just there to make up the numbers."" 3. On the cost of living crisis: ""The cost of living crisis is a fundamental issue that's affecting people's lives right now. We need to address it urgently, and that means investing in public services, in affordable housing, in a decent wage for everyone, and in a universal basic income to ensure that no one is left behind."" 4. On Brexit: ""Brexit is a distraction from the real issues that people are facing. We need to focus on the things that matter to people's lives, like the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and social inequality. We believe that remaining in the European Union is the best way to tackle these issues, but ultimately what's important is finding a solution that works for the majority of people."" 5. On the future of politics: ""The old two-party system is broken. People are looking for new voices, new ideas, and new solutions. The Green Party represents that change. We're not going to be bought off by the big corporations or the wealthy donors. We're here to represent the interests of the people and the planet. And I believe that if we continue to build a movement, we can win."" Mr Bartley's words were met with cheers and applause from the crowd, as he urged them to spread the message of the Green Party and to get involved in their local campaigns. As the rally came to a close, it was clear that the Green Party is not just a fringe movement anymore, but a growing force in British politics.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Coronavirus: 'Tiger King' star now in virus isolation, says husband","Maldonado-Passage, the notorious star of the hit Netflix documentary ""Tiger King,"" has found himself in a new and unexpected predicament: isolation due to the coronavirus. The 57-year-old inmate is currently serving a 22-year sentence for animal abuse and his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot at the Grady Correctional Facility in Florida. According to a statement released by the Florida Department of Corrections, Maldonado-Passage was transferred to a different facility earlier this week after inmates at the Grady Correctional Facility tested positive for COVID-19. He is now being held in isolation at the Lake Correctional Institution in Lake County. The department stated that the transfer was made in accordance with their protocols for managing the spread of the virus. Maldonado-Passage's husband, Jeff Lowe, confirmed the news in a Facebook post on Tuesday. ""Carole is currently in a quarantine cell by himself at Lake Correctional Institution,"" Lowe wrote. ""He is safe and being well taken care of. The Florida Department of Corrections has assured me that they are doing everything they can to keep him safe while he is in their custody."" Lowe went on to express his concern for his husband's wellbeing, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic. ""I worry about Carole's health and safety every day,"" he wrote. ""But I know that God is watching over him and will keep him safe."" Maldonado-Passage's transfer to Lake Correctional Institution comes after a tumultuous few months. In March, he tested positive for COVID-19 while being held at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was later moved to a hospital for treatment before being transferred back to Grady Correctional Facility. The coronavirus pandemic has posed unique challenges for correctional facilities across the country. According to the Marshall Project, more than 13,000 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 in U.S. prisons and jails as of early May. Advocacy groups have called for the release of vulnerable inmates, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, to prevent the spread of the virus in correctional facilities. However, state and federal officials have resisted calls to reduce prison populations, citing concerns over public safety and potential logistical challenges. Maldonado-Passage's isolation is just one example of the many challenges posed by the pandemic for inmates and their families. As the situation continues to evolve, advocacy groups and correctional officials will need to work together to find solutions to keep inmates safe and prevent the spread of the virus. In the meantime, Lowe has urged his followers to keep Maldonado-Passage in their thoughts and prayers. ""I ask",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Westworld's Evan Rachel Wood says she's been raped twice in an open letter on Twitter,"In an open letter on Twitter, the 29-year-old actress Evan Rachel Wood shared her harrowing experiences of being raped twice in her life. She wrote the post after being triggered by the recent allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the ensuing conversation about sexual assault in the entertainment industry. Wood began by recounting the first incident, which occurred with a ""significant other"". She described the experience as ""horrific, haunting, and terrifying"" and revealed that she had been too afraid to speak up about it at the time. She wrote, ""I thought I was going to die"". The second incident took place in a bar, where Wood was assaulted by a man who she had never met before. She detailed how the man had overpowered her and left her feeling ""broken"" and ""worthless"". Wood also spoke about the shame and guilt she felt after both incidents, which kept her from sharing her story for years. Wood's post came as a brave and powerful statement against the culture of silence that has long shrouded the issue of sexual assault. She urged other survivors to speak up and share their stories, writing, ""I know it's hard, and I know how hard it is to come forward, but it is time"". In the aftermath of her post, Wood was met with an outpouring of support from her fans and fellow celebrities. Actresses such as Alyssa Milano and Rose McGowan praised her for her courage and encouraged other survivors to come forward. Wood's revelation also sparked a wider conversation about the need for greater awareness and education around consent and sexual assault. Many people took to social media to share their own stories and to demand change. The actress's bravery in speaking out has inspired many and served as a reminder that survivors of sexual assault are not alone. Wood's open letter is a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of speaking out against injustice. As Wood wrote in her post, ""It's time for us to turn the tables. The predators should be afraid that their victims are no longer silent and will call them out on their shameful behavior. It's time for us to reclaim our power"". Wood's words have resonated with many and have served as a catalyst for change.

Emily Greene: Police admit failings in teen's abuse claim inquiry,"Emily Greene told South Yorkshire Police she had been assaulted by a man, but the force dropped the inquiry. She was found dead in a field near Barnsley in November 2018. Senior Coroner David Urpeth found that there were ""significant failings"" in the way the police handled Emily's report of sexual assault. The inquest into Emily's death heard that she had contacted the police on October 31, 2018, to report an assault by a man she knew. She described the man's appearance and provided details of the location and time of the incident. However, the investigation was closed just 11 days later with no further action taken. Mr Urpeth criticised the police for not interviewing Emily in person or obtaining a statement from her, despite her insistence that she wanted to make a formal complaint. He also expressed concern that the decision to close the investigation was made without sufficient evidence or consideration of the potential risks to Emily's safety. The inquest also heard evidence from Emily's family and friends, who described her as a vulnerable young person who had a history of mental health issues and had previously made suicidal threats. They raised concerns about her safety and urged the police to take her allegations seriously. Mr Urpeth concluded that the police's handling of Emily's report of sexual assault was ""significantly below the standard expected"" and that this failure may have contributed to her death. He made a number of recommendations, including that the police should review their policies and procedures for dealing with reports of sexual assault from vulnerable people, and that they should consider setting up a specialist team to handle such cases. South Yorkshire Police have apologised to Emily's family for the mistakes made in the handling of her case and have pledged to learn from the inquest's findings. A spokesperson for the force said: ""We are deeply sorry for any shortcomings in the way we dealt with this report and for the distress this has caused to Emily's family. We will take action to ensure that we learn from this and improve our response to reports of sexual assault from vulnerable people in the future."" Emily's family have welcomed the coroner's findings and have called for greater support for victims of sexual assault, particularly those who are vulnerable or have mental health issues. They have also urged the police to take their reports seriously and to provide adequate resources to investigate such crimes thoroughly. The inquest into Emily Greene's death is a tragic reminder of the importance of treating reports of sexual assault with the seriousness and sensitivity they deserve. It is essential that the police and other authorities continue to learn from past mistakes and work to improve their response to these cases, to ensure that no family has to endure the pain and loss that Emily's family has experienced.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Amazon also denied the allegations, with a spokesperson stating, ""We vehemently deny the allegations made in the Bloomberg Businessweek article. The safety and security of our customers' data is of paramount importance to us."" The company went on to reiterate its commitment to protecting customer information and the measures it has in place to prevent such incidents. The Bloomberg article, which was published on October 4, cited unnamed sources claiming to have knowledge of the hack. It claimed that the hackers had gained access to Apple and Amazon's internal systems through targeted phishing emails. The sources also claimed that the hackers had stolen data on project plans, customer details, and other sensitive business information. However, Apple and Amazon's denials have cast doubt on the veracity of the report. The companies' robust cybersecurity protocols and rapid response to any potential threats have been hailed as evidence of their commitment to protecting their customers' data. The incident comes at a sensitive time for both tech giants. Apple is currently embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with Epic Games over its App Store policies, while Amazon is facing increased scrutiny from regulators over its business practices. The Bloomberg report, if true, could have damaged their reputations and undermined public trust. Despite the denials, some experts have cautioned against dismissing the report outright. ""Cyber-attacks are a real and growing threat to businesses of all sizes, and it's not uncommon for hackers to use sophisticated methods to gain access to sensitive information,"" said Mark Stanislas, a cybersecurity expert at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's important for companies to take these claims seriously and conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the security of their systems."" The incident has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and cooperation between tech companies and the media when it comes to reporting on cybersecurity threats. ""It's essential that any reporting on cybersecurity incidents is accurate and based on verifiable sources,"" said Sarah Harrison, the editor of The Intercept, a news organization that has been critical of tech companies in the past. ""The media has a responsibility to get it right, and tech companies have a responsibility to be transparent and forthcoming with the public about any potential vulnerabilities in their systems."" In the wake of the report, both Apple and Amazon have reiterated their commitment to transparency and customer privacy. The companies have also pledged to continue to invest in their cybersecurity measures to prevent future attacks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Avocado prices at record high due to reduced harvests,"Avocado prices have surged to record highs due to a perfect storm of surging global demand and reduced harvests from major producers Mexico, Peru, and California. The trend, which has seen a 10-kilogram box of Hass avocados from Mexico's major wholesale producer sell for around $530, is causing shockwaves through the fruit industry and grocery stores worldwide. Mexico, the world's largest avocado exporter, has been hit particularly hard by the price increase. A combination of unfavorable weather conditions and disease outbreaks has significantly reduced the country's avocado production. The situation has been compounded by social unrest in key avocado-producing regions, which has disrupted harvesting and transportation. Peruvian avocado production has also taken a hit this season, with a late onset of the rainy season and extreme weather events causing damage to crops. The country typically exports around 500,000 tons of avocados annually, but this year's harvest is expected to be around 10% lower than previous years. California, the third-largest avocado producer in the world, has also faced challenges in recent months. Drought conditions and frost damage have reduced the crop size and pushed up prices for domestic growers. The situation has been exacerbated by labor shortages, which have made it difficult for farmers to harvest and pack their crops efficiently. The price increase is causing headaches for retailers and consumers alike. Grocery stores are struggling to keep up with demand, and some have been forced to ration sales or even remove avocados from their shelves altogether. Consumers, meanwhile, are facing sticker shock at the checkout line. A single avocado can now cost up to $1.50 or more, making it a luxury item for many households. The high prices are also raising concerns about food security and affordability. Avocados are a staple in many diets, particularly in Latin America and the Mediterranean, and the price increase could make it difficult for some people to access this important source of healthy fats and nutrients. Farmers and industry experts are calling for action to address the root causes of the price increase, including investment in research and development to improve crop yields and reduce reliance on monoculture farming. They are also calling for policies to support small-scale farmers and ensure fair prices for producers. In the meantime, consumers are being urged to be mindful of their avocado consumption and to consider alternative sources of healthy fats, such as nuts and seeds, while prices remain high. It remains to be seen how long the price increase will last, but one thing is certain: the avocado market is in for a bumpy ride in the months ahead.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Weald Hall Care Home which owed Â£1m closes at short notice,"Weald Hall Care Home in Wadhurst, East Sussex, which was home to over 50 vulnerable elderly residents, unexpectedly closed its doors last week, leaving many families in a state of shock and despair. Among those affected is June Wrobel, a 93-year-old resident with dementia, who must now make arrangements to leave the care home by the end of the month. The most recently published accounts for the home, which date back to 2020, reveal that Weald Hall owed more than Â£1m to various creditors. These debts included substantial sums owed to the local council, as well as to healthcare providers and other suppliers. The reasons behind the care home's financial predicament are not clear, but it is believed that the pandemic had a significant impact on its income. The news of the closure came as a shock to the residents and their families, who had grown accustomed to the warm and caring environment provided by Weald Hall. Many had praised the staff for their dedication and compassion, and the home had earned a reputation for providing high-quality care. Now, however, the future looks uncertain for many of the residents, who are being moved to other care homes in the area. The process has been described as chaotic and disorganised, with families left in the dark about the arrangements for their loved ones. Some have raised concerns about the impact of the move on June and other residents with complex needs, particularly those with dementia. The upheaval can be distressing for those with memory problems, and the prospect of leaving familiar surroundings and friends behind can be particularly challenging. The local council has promised to support those affected by the closure, but many families are understandably worried about the standard of care their loved ones will receive in their new homes. They are also concerned about the cost of moving, which can be substantial, and the impact on their loved ones' mental and physical wellbeing. As the situation unfolds, it is clear that this is a challenging time for all those involved. The closure of Weald Hall is a stark reminder of the financial pressures facing the care sector, and the importance of ensuring that vulnerable elderly people are not left without the care and support they need. It is a situation that requires urgent attention and action from both the government and local authorities, to ensure that the rights of residents are protected and that they are able to live with dignity and respect. Meanwhile, June and her fellow residents are left to face an uncertain future, with the prospect of leaving the only home they have known in recent years. It is a situation that is heart-breaking for all involved, and a stark reminder of the importance of investing in the care sector and ensuring that our elderly population is treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid-19: Seven new cases identified on Isle of Man,"The Isle of Man government announced seven new positive cases of Covid-19 on the island, adding to the growing concern over the potential spread of the virus. Five of the latest positive results were linked to a person who had had a ""significant number of high-risk contacts"" during the New Year's Eve period before testing positive on Saturday evening. In a statement, the government urged anyone who had been in close contact with the individual to come forward for testing and to self-isolate immediately. ""We understand that this news may be concerning for many people, but we want to assure the public that we are taking all necessary measures to limit the spread of the virus,"" the statement read. The latest cases bring the total number of confirmed cases on the Isle of Man to 352 since the pandemic began. The government has implemented a range of measures to try and contain the virus, including mandatory testing for arrivals on the island, strict guidelines for social distancing, and the closure of certain non-essential businesses. Health officials are working to identify and contact trace all those who may have come into contact with the latest positive cases. The government is also urging people to continue following the guidance to help prevent the spread of the virus. ""We cannot stress enough the importance of following the guidelines, wearing masks, washing hands regularly, and maintaining social distancing,"" the statement said. The news comes as the UK government announced that all adults in the UK will be offered a coronavirus vaccine by the end of July. The Isle of Man government has said that it is working closely with the UK to ensure that it receives its fair share of the vaccine. ""We will be prioritising the most vulnerable members of our community first, as set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,"" a government spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the Isle of Man's borders remain closed to non-essential travellers, with only those arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) exempt. The CTA includes countries such as the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man itself. Those arriving from outside the CTA are required to provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure, and to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival. The government is urging people to continue to follow the guidance and to stay vigilant. ""We understand that this is a difficult time for many people, but we must all do our part to help protect each other and prevent the spread of the virus,"" the statement concluded.

McDermott pulls out of race to run City watchdog,"Tracey McDermott, the former acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), later confirmed she had withdrawn from the recruitment process to become the next City watchdog, leaving the race wide open. Her decision came after a lengthy selection process that had seen her emerge as one of the front-runners for the position. The news of McDermott's departure came as a surprise to many in the financial industry, who had seen her as a strong contender to succeed Martin Wheatley as the head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Wheatley, who left the organisation in March, had been in the role since 2014 and was credited with implementing a number of significant reforms during his tenure. McDermott had been widely praised for her leadership during her time at the FCA, particularly in her handling of the investigation into the manipulation of the Libor interbank lending rate. She had also been instrumental in the implementation of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, which holds individuals accountable for their actions within their organisations. Despite her strong credentials, McDermott's decision to withdraw from the recruitment process came as a blow to those hoping for a swift appointment to the top job. The FCA has been without a permanent chief executive since Wheatley's departure, and the delay in filling the role has raised concerns about the regulator's ability to respond effectively to emerging risks in the financial sector. The search for a new FCA chief executive is expected to continue in the coming weeks, with a number of candidates believed to be in the running. Among them are Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England, and Nausicaa Delfas, the director of international at the FCA. Both candidates have significant experience in the financial sector and are well respected within the industry. Bailey has been a key figure in the Bank of England's response to the financial crisis and has been instrumental in the implementation of the new regulatory framework for banks. Delfas, meanwhile, has spent over a decade at the FCA and has played a key role in the development of the regulator's international strategy. Whichever candidate is ultimately appointed, they will inherit a challenging role. The FCA is facing increasing pressure to adapt to a rapidly changing financial landscape, with new technologies and business models posing significant risks to consumers and financial stability. At the same time, the regulator must balance its regulatory responsibilities with the need to support innovation and growth in the financial sector. With McDermott out of the race, the next few weeks are expected to be a pivotal moment in the search for the new FCA chief executive. Whichever candidate emerges as the front-runner will have a tough act to follow in the footsteps of Martin Wheatley, but they will also have the opportunity to shape the future",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Reading school teacher jailed over sex with pupil,"Oliver Glass, a former maths teacher at St Joseph's College in Reading, was sentenced to 22 months in prison after admitting to having sex with a 16-year-old pupil. Reading Crown Court heard how Glass, who is now 33 years old, had groomed the girl before the incidents took place. The court was told that the relationship between Glass and the victim began in the summer term of 2019. Glass reportedly contacted the girl on social media, and their conversations quickly turned flirtatious. The victim testified that Glass had asked her for explicit images and had made suggestive comments. The first sexual encounter between the two occurred in Glass's car during the summer holidays. The victim revealed in court that the teacher had given her alcohol before engaging in sexual activity with her. This incident was followed by two further encounters, with the last one taking place at Glass's home. The offences came to light when the victim's mother became suspicious and discovered the inappropriate messages on her daughter's phone. The school was then informed, and the police were called in. Glass was arrested and charged with five counts of sexual activity with a child. Defending Glass, his barrister argued that his client had been suffering from depression and had been seeking help from his GP at the time of the offences. He added that Glass had no previous convictions and that the victim had not been formally interviewed by the police before making her statement. However, the prosecution noted that Glass had taken advantage of a position of trust and had deliberately targeted a vulnerable young person. The judge agreed, stating that the offences were ""serious and significant"" and that the victim had been ""manipulated and exploited"" by Glass. The judge also took into account the impact on the victim, who had suffered distress and anxiety as a result of the incidents. In addition to the prison sentence, Glass was also ordered to sign the sex offender register and was banned from working with children indefinitely. Detective Inspector Damian Duffy, the officer in charge of the investigation, commended the victim for her courage in coming forward and encouraged anyone who has been affected by similar incidents to contact the police. He added that the force would take reports of this nature seriously and would work to bring offenders to justice. St Joseph's College released a statement expressing their disappointment and shock at the events and assured parents that they were fully cooperating with the police and the local education authority. The school also stated that they had put in place additional safeguarding measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Veterans' war memories given life in 'virtual' tour,"Poppyscotland, the leading Armed Forces charity in Scotland, has embarked on an unusual yet innovative Remembrance project in collaboration with games developers at Abertay University. This groundbreaking initiative aims to bring the memories and experiences of veterans to life in a virtual tour of the Lady Haig Poppy Factory in Edinburgh. As users don their headsets and step into the virtual world, they are transported back in time to the early 20th century. The factory hums with activity as workers, dressed in period attire, busily assemble poppies for the iconic Poppyscotland wreaths. The scent of fresh petals and fabric wafts through the air, evoking a sense of nostalgia and history. Veterans, who have been part of the project's development, share their stories and memories as users navigate through the virtual factory. Users can interact with these veterans, asking questions and learning about their experiences in the armed forces and the impact the poppy factory had on their lives. One veteran shares a story of how the factory provided a sense of purpose and community after his return from the battlefield. Another talks about the importance of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance and hope. These personal anecdotes breathe life into the history of the poppy factory and the broader context of war and its aftermath. As users explore the virtual factory, they can also learn about the history of the poppy and its significance in Remembrance ceremonies. Interactive exhibits explain the origins of the poppy as a symbol of remembrance from the poem ""In Flanders Fields"" by John McCrae. Users can also learn about the production process of the poppies and the role the factory plays in supporting the Armed Forces community. The virtual tour also includes a recreation of the Edinburgh Poppy Factory parade, where users can join veterans in a procession through the streets of Edinburgh, culminating in the laying of wreaths at the National War Memorial. This immersive experience offers users a unique insight into the history and significance of the poppy and the impact it has had on the lives of veterans. The collaboration between Poppyscotland and Abertay University represents a new approach to preserving and sharing war memories. By combining the power of technology with the stories and experiences of veterans, this project offers a fresh perspective on the history of war and its impact on individuals and communities. The Remembrance project is an ongoing initiative, with plans to expand the virtual tour to include other significant sites and stories from Scotland's military history. This innovative approach to remembering and honouring the past is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and the role technology can play in preserving and sharing our collective history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pakistan blasphemy: Gunman shoots accused dead in court,"By Secunder Kermani BBC News, Islamabad He had been facing charges for allegedly claiming to be a prophet. Blasphemy is legally punishable by death in Pakistan, a country where religious sensitivities run deep and the law is often used to settle scores or target minorities. The man, identified as Muhammad Afzal, was brought to the courtroom in the eastern city of Lahore handcuffed and surrounded by police. His accusers, a group of local religious hardliners, were also present in the courtroom, their faces covered with masks. As Afzal was led into the courtroom, the atmosphere was already volatile. Protesters had gathered outside, demanding that the blasphemer be executed on the spot. The police had taken precautions, but it seemed inevitable that violence would follow. The judge began the proceedings, reading out the charges against Afzal. He remained calm and composed, denying the allegations. But his accusers were not satisfied. They began shouting slogans and threatening to take the law into their own hands. Suddenly, gunshots rang out in the courtroom. Afzal's accused assailants, armed with pistols, opened fire. The judge and other officials in the courtroom managed to take cover, but Afzal was not so lucky. He was hit several times and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The gunmen fled the scene, leaving Afzal to die. The police launched a manhunt for the assailants, but they managed to escape. Afzal's death marked a tragic end to a case that had already attracted widespread attention and controversy. The incident sparked condemnation from human rights groups and religious minorities. They accused the government of failing to protect the accused and uphold the rule of law. The authorities, they said, had once again shown that in Pakistan, the law can be used as a weapon against those perceived to be blasphemers. The killing of Muhammad Afzal was not an isolated incident. Pakistan has a long history of blasphemy cases, many of which have been used to settle personal scores or target minorities. The law, which carries the death penalty for blasphemy, is often misused and has been the subject of international criticism. The case of Muhammad Afzal serves as a reminder of the dangers that exist in Pakistan for those accused of blasphemy. It also highlights the need for reforms to the law and the need for the authorities to protect the accused and uphold the rule of law.

"Arson arrest of boy, 15, as dogs killed in Manchester kennels fire","Police said the number of animals that have died in a devastating fire at a Manchester kennels is expected to rise as investigators continue their inquiries. Four crews from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service were at the scene of the blaze, which broke out at the kennels on the outskirts of the city early on Monday morning. Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs and seeing flames and smoke billowing from the building, which houses around 80 dogs. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but a 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of arson. Detectives are currently questioning the teenager, who was reportedly seen in the area around the time of the fire. Investigators believe he may have started the blaze, but a motive for the crime is not yet clear. The fire spread rapidly through the kennels, which are located in a rural area of Manchester. Firefighters were able to prevent the blaze from spreading to nearby buildings, but the kennels were completely gutted. The RSPCA has described the incident as ""devastating"" and ""heart-breaking"". A spokesperson for the animal welfare charity said: ""Our thoughts are with the owners of the dogs and all those affected by this terrible fire. We are working closely with the emergency services and the police to establish what has happened and how we can best support those affected."" The dogs at the kennels were all accounted for, but several were reportedly killed in the fire. Others sustained injuries and are being treated by vets. The number of animals that have died is expected to rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear. The fire comes just days after another kennels in Staffordshire was destroyed by a blaze, which killed 12 dogs. The cause of that fire is also under investigation. The Manchester kennels fire has shocked the local community, with many expressing their sympathy and support for the owners of the dogs and the staff at the kennels. A fundraising page has been set up to help those affected by the fire, with thousands of pounds already raised. Detectives are appealing for anyone with information about the fire or the boy in question to come forward. Anyone with information should contact Greater Manchester Police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. As the investigation into the fire continues, the RSPCA is providing support to the owners of the dogs and helping to care for those that have survived. The charity is urging anyone who is able to offer a temporary home to a dog affected by the fire to get in touch.

Does Russian-language Siri have a problem with gays?,"By BBC Trending What's popular and why A video posted earlier this week showing a conversation in Russian between Siri and a man has sparked debate online about whether the Russian-language version of Apple's virtual assistant has a problem with gays. The man in the video asks Siri to define the word ""Ð³ÐµÐ¹"" (gay), and Siri responds by saying ""Ð³ÐµÐ¸ - ÑÑÐ¾ Ð¼ÑÐ¶ÑÐ¸Ð½Ñ, ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐµ Ð»ÑÐ±ÑÑ Ð´ÑÑÐ³Ð¸Ñ Ð¼ÑÐ¶ÑÐ¸Ð½"" (gays - these are men who love other men). The man then asks Siri to find him a gay bar in Moscow, and Siri responds by saying ""Ð² ÐÐ¾ÑÐºÐ²Ðµ Ð½ÐµÑ Ð³ÐµÐ¹-Ð±Ð°ÑÐ¾Ð², Ð½Ð¾ ÐµÑÑÑ ÐºÐ»ÑÐ±Ñ Ð´Ð»Ñ Ð»ÑÐ±Ð¸ÑÐµÐ»ÐµÐ¹ ÑÐ°Ð½Ð³Ð¾"" (there are no gay bars in Moscow, but there are clubs for lovers of tango). The video quickly went viral on Russian social media, with some users expressing concern that Siri was promoting intolerance and discrimination against the LGBT+ community. Others, however, saw the incident as a simple misunderstanding, pointing out that Siri was just providing information based on the data it had been given. Apple Russia released a statement saying that Siri ""does not have the ability to access or search the web, and responds with information from its own database"". The company added that it was ""committed to equality and we believe in equality for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity"". But some users remained unconvinced, arguing that Siri's responses were still problematic, as they reinforced negative stereotypes and perpetuated myths about the LGBT+ community. Others suggested that Apple should do more to ensure that Siri's responses were inclusive and accurate, particularly in countries where LGBT+ rights are not well-established. The incident comes at a sensitive time in Russia, where anti-LGBT+ sentiment is on the rise. In recent years, the Russian government has passed a number of laws that have been criticised by human rights groups for promoting discrimination against the LGBT+ community. In 2013, Russia passed a law banning ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships among minors"", which has been criticised by the European Court of Human Rights and other international bodies. Despite these challenges, there are signs that attitudes towards the LGBT+ community are changing in Russia. In 2019, for the first time, Moscow Pride was allowed to go ahead without violence or arrests. And in 2020, St Petersburg became the first city in Russia to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and education. The Siri controversy is just the latest in a series of incidents that have highlighted the challenges faced by the LGBT+ community in Russia. But it also serves as a reminder of the important role that technology companies can play in promoting equality and challenging discrimination.

Rolf Harris conviction: Australia reacts to star's fall,"Jon Donnison, BBC Sydney correspondent: The trial has received widespread coverage here and has often been front page news. The verdict came too late for the many fans who gathered outside Sydney's Downing Centre District Court on Thursday, hoping to catch a glimpse of Rolf Harris as he left after being found guilty of multiple sexual offences. But for those who had waited for the outcome, the conviction of the much-loved entertainer brought a mix of shock and relief. ""I'm glad he's finally been brought to justice,"" said one woman, who asked not to be identified. ""It's been a long time coming."" Harris, 84, was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault, with the offences dating back to the late 1960s and 1970s. The victims were aged between seven and 16 at the time. Many Australians grew up with Harris's songs and TV shows. He was a regular guest on children's programmes and was known for his painting and singing, including the catchy hit ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"". But for some, the entertainment masked a darker side. The allegations against Harris first emerged in 2013 when he was arrested in the UK. He was extradited to Australia in 2014 and charged with multiple offences. The trial, which lasted 13 days, heard harrowing testimony from several women. Some of the victims were young girls who had met Harris at his Sydney studio or at school events. The jury's verdict brought a sense of closure for some of the victims, who had bravely come forward to give evidence. But it was a difficult time for others, who were affected by the graphic details of the testimony. ""I'm just glad it's over now,"" said one woman, who had attended the trial every day. ""It's been a long and emotional process for everyone involved."" The conviction of Harris, who had denied all the allegations, is likely to have a far-reaching impact. He is expected to be sentenced in June and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count. But the trial has also sparked wider debate in Australia about sexual abuse and its impact on victims. The #MeToo movement has brought more attention to the issue, and there have been calls for more support for victims and stricter measures to protect children. ""This trial has shown us that no one is above the law, no matter how famous or beloved they might be,"" said one campaigner. ""It's important that we continue to support victims and hold abusers accountable."" For many Australians, the Rolf Harris trial has been a reminder of the importance of speaking out about abuse and seeking justice for victims.

US envoy Susan Rice admits Benghazi attack error,"UN Ambassador Susan Rice met with senators on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, seeking to clarify her statements regarding the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The meeting came after Rice's controversial appearances on five Sunday talk shows, during which she asserted that the attack was a result of a spontaneous protest against an anti-Islam video, rather than a planned terrorist act. Rice began the meeting by insisting that there had been no attempt to mislead the public. ""I provided information based on what I had been briefed and what I, and my colleagues, had been told at the time,"" she said. ""My comments were in keeping with the assessments provided by our intelligence community."" However, senators remained unconvinced. Following the meeting, they expressed their continued concerns about the administration's handling of the Benghazi attack and Rice's role in shaping the public narrative. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) stated, ""She continues to maintain that she was just passing along information, but the information she was passing along was incorrect."" Graham added that Rice's statements had ""undermined the credibility of the administration."" Senator John McCain (R-AZ) echoed Graham's sentiments, stating, ""The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened in Benghazi and why the administration chose to mislead them for two weeks."" Democrats, on the other hand, defended Rice and criticized the Republicans for politicizing the issue. ""This is a partisan witch hunt,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL). ""Susan Rice was simply relaying information that she received from our intelligence community."" Despite the heated rhetoric, it remains unclear what new information will emerge from the investigation into the Benghazi attack. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees are currently conducting their own inquiries into the matter, but so far, no evidence has been presented to suggest that the White House intentionally misled the public. In the meantime, Rice's credibility has been called into question, and her role as a potential candidate for secretary of state in a second term Hillary Clinton administration has been cast into doubt. The Benghazi controversy has also fueled calls for greater transparency and accountability from the Obama administration, particularly in the area of intelligence gathering and analysis. As the investigation continues, the political fallout from the Benghazi attack is likely to persist, with both sides using the issue to score points in the run-up to the 2014 mid-term elections and the 2016 presidential race.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ex-schools mental health champion criticises axing of role,"Natasha Devon, the former mental health champion for schools, told BBC Newsnight that she was deeply disappointed by the government's decision to axe her role. Devon, who had been appointed to the position in 2016, had been passionate about giving young people a voice at the highest levels of government. ""I'm deeply concerned about the implications of this decision,"" Devon said. ""Mental health issues affect one in ten children and young people in the UK, and yet there seems to be a lack of political will to address this crisis. My role as mental health champion for schools was a crucial step in raising awareness and ensuring that young people's voices were heard."" Devon's appointment was part of the government's response to the 2016 Parliamentary Inquiry into Children and Young People's Mental Health and Emotional Wellbeing. The inquiry highlighted the need for greater investment in mental health services for young people, as well as a focus on prevention and early intervention. Devon's role involved working with schools, teachers, and young people to promote good mental health and challenge stigma. She also represented the views of young people on mental health issues to government, and advised ministers on policy. But now, just three years after her appointment, the role has been scrapped. The government has instead announced plans to offer schools a range of mental health resources, which will be made available through an online hub. Devon questioned the effectiveness of this approach. ""It's all very well to provide resources, but without someone to lead on mental health at a national level, how will we ensure that these resources are used effectively? How will we ensure that mental health is prioritised in schools, and that young people's voices are heard?"" Devon also criticised the government for not investing enough in mental health services for young people more broadly. ""We need to see real investment in mental health services, not just in schools but across the board. We need to see a cultural shift, where mental health is seen as just as important as physical health. And we need to listen to young people, and take their experiences and concerns seriously."" Devon's departure from her role comes at a time when mental health issues among young people are more pressing than ever. The pandemic has had a significant impact on young people's mental health, with many experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and isolation. But despite these challenges, Devon remains optimistic. ""I'm not going to let this setback discourage me. I'm going to continue to work on raising awareness of mental health issues, and giving young people a voice. I believe that if we work together, we can make a difference.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Valve shuts down money laundering via CS:GO game,"In a statement, Valve Corporation, the creators of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), announced that they had taken steps to shut down money laundering activities within their popular gaming platform. The company acknowledged that the game had been targeted by global cyber-criminals looking to ""liquidate their gains"" through CS:GO's complex in-game economy. The criminals had been exploiting the platform to launder funds obtained through illegal activities, such as ransomware attacks, fraud, and other digital crimes. By purchasing and trading in-game items, they could mask the origin of their ill-gotten gains and make them appear as legitimate digital assets. Valve explained that the money laundering scheme involved the purchase of inexpensive in-game items with real money, which were then traded in a complex web of transactions among a network of individuals and groups. These items, often cosmetic skins for weapons or player avatars, could then be sold for significantly higher prices to unsuspecting buyers. The difference between the purchase and sale price was the profit that the criminals made, effectively laundering their funds. Valve acknowledged that the issue had been a persistent problem within the CS:GO community for some time. The company had previously taken steps to curb the issue, such as implementing a trading hold on certain items and updating their Economic Report to make it easier for users to understand the market trends. However, the criminals had continued to find ways around these measures. In a bid to tackle the problem more effectively, Valve announced that it would be implementing a new system to monitor and restrict economic activity within the game. The new system would use machine learning algorithms and other advanced techniques to identify suspicious patterns of trading activity and flag them for review by Valve's security team. This would enable the company to intervene in cases of potential money laundering before significant damage was done. Valve also urged users to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity they might encounter within the game. The company provided a link to a report form on its website, where users could submit information about potential money laundering or other illegal activities. Valve pledged to take swift action against any users found to be involved in such activities, and to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to bring the criminals to justice. In conclusion, Valve's announcement marked a significant step forward in the fight against money laundering within the gaming community. The company's commitment to protecting its users from such criminal activities and its use of advanced technologies to detect and prevent them is a welcome development. However, it is essential that users remain vigilant and continue to report any suspicious activity they might encounter. By working together, the gaming community and its creators can create a safer and more secure environment for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Students 'worst' at e-book piracy, says data monitor","By Chi Chi Izundu, Newsbeat entertainment reporter NetNames, a digital intelligence company, has revealed that students in the UK are among the worst offenders when it comes to e-book piracy. The company's investigators looked at the availability of 50 popular textbooks across five different disciplines in the UK, and were alarmed by the results. In total, 76% of the titles were available to download for free from various peer-to-peer file-sharing sites. This is a concerning figure, especially as e-books are becoming increasingly popular in education. The investigation found that the most pirated titles were in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), with 84% of the textbooks in this category being made available for free download. This is particularly worrying, as these subjects often require students to have access to the most up-to-date information and resources. The second most pirated category was Business and Management, with 78% of the textbooks in this area being made available for free. This is followed by Arts and Humanities (73%), Health Sciences (69%), and Social Sciences (65%). NetNames warned that piracy not only undermines the revenue of publishers and authors, but also puts students at risk of using outdated or inaccurate information. The company's Director of Investigations, Paul Harris, said: ""Students need access to the most up-to-date information to succeed in their studies. Piracy not only denies publishers and authors the revenue they deserve but also puts students at risk of using inaccurate or outdated information."" The company is urging students to consider the ethical implications of piracy and to instead invest in legitimate sources of e-books. Harris added: ""There are plenty of legitimate ways for students to access e-books, from purchasing them outright or borrowing them from libraries, to renting them for a fee. Piracy not only harms the creators of the content but also undermines the integrity of the academic community."" NetNames is not the only organisation to raise concerns about e-book piracy. The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has also warned that the illegal downloading of e-books is on the rise. In a statement, the IPO said: ""Piracy undermines the creative industries and can lead to financial losses for authors, publishers and universities. We encourage students to only use legitimate sources of e-books and to respect the intellectual property rights of others."" The rise of e-books has brought many benefits to students, including greater accessibility and affordability. But it also comes with its own challenges, including the risks of piracy. As the use of e-books continues to grow, it is important that students are aware of the ethical implications and the risks associated with piracy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
NI Assembly election: Former submariner Steve Aiken surfaces at Stormont,"By Mervyn Jess, BBC News NI For some it was a return to the familiar, while for others it was akin to stepping into uncharted waters. At Stormont, the heart of Northern Ireland's political landscape, a new face emerged among the veteran politicians. Steve Aiken, a former submariner, was making his first foray into the world of politics as a candidate for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in the recent Assembly election. Aiken, who served in the Royal Navy for 25 years, was no stranger to navigating through complex situations. However, the political arena presented challenges of a different nature. With a military career that saw him serving on various submarines, including the HMS Vanguard, the UK's nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, Aiken was used to following orders and working as part of a team. But the world of politics required a different set of skills. As a candidate for the DUP, Aiken was tasked with appealing to the voters and winning their trust. He campaigned on a platform of ensuring the interests of his constituents were represented, with a focus on issues such as education, healthcare, and jobs. Aiken's military past provided an intriguing contrast to the world of politics. During his campaign, he drew attention to his discipline, teamwork, and leadership abilities. He also emphasised the importance of serving one's community, just as he had served his country in the military. The election results saw Aiken secure a seat as an MLA for the DUP in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. His victory was met with excitement and anticipation, not just from the DUP, but also from the broader electorate. Aiken's unique background and personal story had captured the imagination of many voters. As Aiken took his seat in the Assembly, the question on many minds was how his military experience would translate into political action. Would he be able to bring the same level of discipline and focus to the political arena? Could his leadership abilities help steer the DUP and Northern Ireland through the challenges that lay ahead? Only time would tell. But one thing was certain - Steve Aiken's journey from the depths of the ocean to the halls of Stormont was a testament to the fact that no matter the background, everyone had a role to play in shaping the future of Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"A&E facing serious problem, health minister admits","Rising attendances have meant A&E units in England have started struggling to hit the four-hour waiting time target. The problem has got so bad that NHS England has been forced to declare a major incident in some areas. This comes as the health service faces unprecedented pressure due to a combination of factors, including an increase in flu cases, a backlog of patients from the winter months, and a shortage of hospital beds. The situation has been described as ""challenging"" by Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid, who admitted that the NHS is ""under more pressure than it has been for many years."" Speaking to the BBC, Javid acknowledged that ""there are challenges in A&E departments across the country,"" and promised that the government would be taking ""immediate steps"" to address the issue. One of the measures being considered is the deployment of military personnel to help out in A&E departments. The Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed that the Ministry of Defence is in talks with the NHS about providing support. Wallace said that the military could provide ""skills and resources"" to help ease the pressure on the health service. Another solution being explored is the use of private hospitals to treat NHS patients. Javid has announced that the government will be making Â£300 million available to hospitals to buy in extra capacity from the private sector. This could include the hiring of additional beds and the outsourcing of treatments such as hip replacements and cataract surgery. However, some critics have warned that these measures may not be enough to solve the underlying problems. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has called for a long-term solution to the crisis, including increased funding for the NHS and a focus on preventative care. Dr Katherine Henderson, the college's president, said that ""we need to invest in A&E departments and the wider health service to ensure that they can meet the needs of the population."" Meanwhile, patients have been urged to only attend A&E if they have a serious or life-threatening condition. Non-emergency cases are being asked to consider other options, such as their local GP surgery or pharmacy. The NHS website provides a list of alternatives for those who are unsure about where to go. Despite these efforts, the situation in some A&E departments remains critical. In the past week alone, over 50,000 patients waited more than four hours to be seen, and some hospitals have reported waits of up to 12 hours. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming weeks, with flu cases on the rise and the winter weather making it more difficult for some people to access healthcare. As the NHS faces its biggest crisis in years, the government is under pressure to take action to address the problem.

Garda chief fears false data 'not confined to traffic',"Her speech was circulated to committee members on Wednesday, following the revelation that almost one million drink-driving tests recorded by the Garda (Irish Police) did not exist. This startling discovery has cast a shadow over the integrity of the force's data and raised serious concerns about the accuracy of other records. Addressing the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) Joint Committee on Justice, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris acknowledged the gravity of the situation and expressed his deep regret over the issue. He emphasised that the false data was not confined to traffic offences but extended to other areas, including criminal investigations. Commissioner Harris stated, ""I want to be clear that this issue is not about trying to hide the facts or to downplay the significance of any incidents. It is about ensuring that the data we hold is accurate and reliable."" He went on to explain that the false data had been identified as a result of a data cleansing exercise undertaken by the Garda. The Commissioner also reassured the committee that the investigation into the matter was ongoing and that the Garda was cooperating fully with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. He pledged to keep the committee updated on the progress of the investigation and to provide a comprehensive report on the issue once it was completed. Despite the severity of the situation, Commissioner Harris maintained that the vast majority of Garda records were accurate and that the public could continue to have confidence in the force. He emphasised that the Garda was committed to transparency and accountability and that the organisation was taking steps to address the underlying causes of the issue. The Commissioner also acknowledged that the discovery of the false data was a blow to the morale of the Garda and that it was essential that the organisation learned from the experience. He called on his officers to remain focused on their duties and to continue to serve their communities with integrity and professionalism. As the committee hearing continued, members expressed their concerns about the implications of the false data and called on the Garda to provide assurances that similar issues would not arise in the future. The Commissioner reiterated his commitment to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the Garda's data and pledged to take all necessary steps to prevent any recurrence of the issue. The discovery of the false data has raised significant questions about the Garda's record-keeping and has prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability. As the investigation continues, the full extent of the issue and its implications for the Garda and the wider criminal justice system are yet to be determined.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fresh plans for Torfaen's 'British' site,"The 1,300 acre (526 hectares) brownfield site at Talywain, near Pontypool, called ""The British"" has been derelict for 30 years. This once bustling industrial hub, which was home to businesses such as coal mining, steel manufacturing, and textiles, has been left to decay, a sad reminder of the past. However, fresh plans have emerged to breathe new life into this forgotten corner of Torfaen. The Welsh Government, in collaboration with Torfaen County Borough Council and other stakeholders, have announced a major regeneration project for the site. The ambitious plan includes the creation of a new urban village, which will provide housing for up to 4,000 people. This will include a mix of affordable and market rate homes, as well as apartments and townhouses. The development will also incorporate community facilities such as schools, a health centre, community centre, and a supermarket. In addition to the urban village, there will be a significant focus on creating new jobs and economic opportunities. The site will be transformed into a hub for advanced manufacturing, research and development, and innovation. This will include a business park, which will be home to high-tech companies, as well as a new innovation centre, which will provide support and resources for start-up businesses. The regeneration project will also prioritise sustainability and the environment. This will include the creation of green spaces, such as parks and community gardens, as well as the implementation of renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines. The development will also include a comprehensive transport plan, with a focus on public transport and active travel, such as walking and cycling. The regeneration project has received a warm welcome from local residents and stakeholders. Cllr Paul Hart, the Leader of Torfaen County Borough Council, said ""This is a fantastic opportunity to bring this derelict site back into use, and to create new jobs and economic opportunities for the people of Torfaen. We're looking forward to working closely with the Welsh Government and other stakeholders to make this vision a reality."" The project is still in its early stages, with a detailed planning application expected to be submitted later this year. If approved, construction is expected to begin in 2024, with the first homes and businesses expected to be occupied by 2027. This regeneration project is a testament to the power of collaboration and the potential for brownfield sites to be transformed into vibrant, sustainable communities.

Boohoo warned over advertising real fur as fake,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint it received about a pom pom jumper being sold by the online retailer Boohoo. The complainant argued that the pom poms on the jumper were advertised as being made of ""faux fur,"" but upon closer inspection, they appeared to be made of real fur. Boohoo, in response, maintained that the pom poms were indeed faux fur and that the error may have occurred during the manufacturing process. However, the ASA was not convinced and ruled that the advertisement was misleading. This is not the first time Boohoo has faced allegations of selling real fur as faux. In 2018, the retailer was criticized for selling a coat with what appeared to be real rabbit fur hood linings, despite being labeled as faux. Boohoo subsequently removed the item from sale and issued an apology. The use of real fur in advertising and sales, even unintentionally, is a contentious issue. Animal rights activists argue that the use of real fur contributes to the cruel treatment and killing of animals, and that consumers should be fully informed about the origin of the materials they are purchasing. Boohoo, like many other fashion retailers, has previously stated its commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. The company has a policy against the use of real fur in its products and has signed up to the Fur Free Retailer program, which requires retailers to confirm that they do not sell real fur. However, the ASA ruling raises questions about the effectiveness of self-regulation in the fashion industry. While Boohoo has a policy against the use of real fur, it appears that in some cases, real fur may still end up in their products. The ASA has given Boohoo until March 16 to remove the offending product from sale and to ensure that all future advertising is truthful and not misleading. The authority also advised Boohoo to ensure that its suppliers are aware of the company's policies on real fur and to take steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Boohoo has announced that it will be conducting an internal investigation into the matter and will be working with its suppliers to prevent any further incidents. The retailer has also apologized for any confusion caused and has offered a refund to anyone who has purchased the jumper in question. The ASA ruling is a reminder that even well-intentioned companies can make mistakes when it comes to the sourcing and labeling of materials. It is important for retailers to have robust systems in place to ensure that their products are ethically and sustainably sourced, and for consumers to be vigilant and ask questions when they have concerns.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New electric trains approved after windscreens changed,"Train drivers' union Aslef had raised concerns over the curved windscreens on the Class 385 electric trains, highlighting how the reflective surfaces were causing issues with night-time signalling. Following these reports, Transport for London (TfL) and train leasing company Angel Trains have announced that new flat windscreens will now be fitted to all 70 of the trains. The decision to replace the windscreens comes after extensive testing and consultation with Aslef, with the new design expected to significantly reduce reflections and improve safety for train drivers. The union had previously voiced their fears that the reflections could lead to potential collisions or derailments due to drivers being unable to clearly see signals. TfL's Rail and Customer Operations Director, Tom Molloy, commented on the issue, saying, ""Safety is our top priority, and we understand the concerns raised by Aslef regarding the Class 385 trains' windscreens. We have worked closely with Angel Trains and Aslef to find a solution, and we are pleased that a solution has been found, and new windscreens will be installed as soon as possible."" Angel Trains, the train leasing company responsible for the Class 385 fleet, have indicated that the windscreen replacement programme will commence in the coming weeks, with the first trains expected to have the new flat windscreens fitted by the end of the month. The remainder of the fleet is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Aslef General Secretary, Mick Whelan, expressed his satisfaction with the outcome, stating, ""This is an important safety matter, and I'm glad that TfL and Angel Trains have listened to our concerns and taken swift action to address the issue. Flat windscreens will significantly reduce reflections, making it safer for our drivers to operate these trains."" Passengers using the Class 385 trains, which run between London and suburban areas such as Gillingham, Dartford, and Southend Victoria, are being advised to expect some disruption during the windscreen replacement programme. TfL and Angel Trains have assured passengers that every effort will be made to keep disruption to a minimum and that services will continue to run as normal as possible. The Class 385 electric trains, which were first introduced into service in 2009, have been a staple of London's rail network, providing essential services to commuters and passengers. With the new flat windscreens set to be installed, the trains will not only become safer but also more visually distinctive, as the curved windscreens have been a distinctive feature of the Class 385 fleet since their introduction.

UN: World's forests fundamental to human well-being,"By Mark Kinver, Environment reporter, BBC News Eva Mueller, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Forestry Division, has underlined the importance of the world's forests to human well-being, following the release of the UN's State of the Forests report. Ms Mueller said trees provided a direct source of food, fuel, and income for millions of people around the world, particularly in developing countries. ""Forests continue to play a crucial role in sustaining the livelihoods of around 1.6 billion people worldwide,"" she explained. ""They are a vital resource for food security, providing an estimated 15% of the world's food, and are a key source of income for many communities through activities such as forestry, tourism, and non-timber forest products."" According to the report, around 2.2 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods, with more than half a billion people directly depending on forests for their food. In Africa, for example, around 70% of the population live in rural areas, where forests provide a significant source of food and income. The report also highlights the importance of forests in the fight against climate change. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing around 30% of global carbon dioxide emissions. They also help to regulate the Earth's climate by releasing water vapor, which contributes to cloud formation and can help to cool the planet. Despite their importance, forests continue to be lost at an alarming rate. The report estimates that around 10 million hectares of forest are lost each year, equivalent to around 27 football pitches per minute. Deforestation is driven by a range of factors, including agriculture, logging, and urbanization. Ms Mueller called for urgent action to address the root causes of deforestation and to promote sustainable forest management. ""We need to recognize the value of forests and the services they provide, and work to ensure that they are managed sustainably,"" she said. ""This means promoting forest conservation, reducing deforestation, and supporting communities to manage their forests in a sustainable way."" The report also calls for increased investment in sustainable forest management, particularly in developing countries. This could include support for community-led forest management initiatives, as well as investments in research and development to improve forest management practices. In conclusion, the UN's State of the Forests report underlines the vital role that forests play in human well-being, from providing food and income to helping to combat climate change. However, the report also highlights the urgent need for action to address the threats facing forests, and to promote sustainable forest management. By working together, we can ensure that forests continue to provide these vital services for future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hollywood actor Jason Statham shoots SAS movie in Wales,"The Killer Elite, the latest action thriller starring Hollywood actor Jason Statham, is currently filming in the picturesque landscapes of Wales. The movie, based on a book by renowned British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, sheds light on a dark and little-known chapter in the history of the Special Air Service (SAS). According to reports, scenes featuring Statham in his role as an elite soldier are being shot in the breathtaking Conwy Valley. The rugged terrain and dense forests provide an ideal backdrop for the high-octane sequences, which promise to deliver the adrenaline-pumping action that fans of Statham have come to expect. The Killer Elite is said to be inspired by Sir Ranulph Fiennes' book, ""The Feather Men,"" which tells the true story of the murder of several SAS soldiers in the late 1960s. The film explores the lengths to which the military and intelligence services went to uncover the truth behind these brutal killings. Statham, known for his roles in the Transporter and The Expendables franchises, has been preparing for the physically demanding part for months. Photos and videos from the set have shown the actor undergoing rigorous training, including weapons handling, hand-to-hand combat, and endurance exercises. The Welsh countryside has provided the perfect setting for the film's intense action scenes. One sequence, which was filmed at the historic Conwy Castle, sees Statham's character engage in a brutal hand-to-hand combat battle on the castle walls. Another scene, set in the dense forests of the valley, features a high-speed chase through the trees. Despite the challenging conditions, Statham and the crew have been making the most of their time in Wales. Local residents have reportedly welcomed the production team with open arms, with many offering their homes and businesses as filming locations. The Killer Elite is expected to hit cinemas in late 2023, and fans of Statham and the action genre are eagerly anticipating its release. With its stunning Welsh locations, intense action sequences, and a compelling true story at its heart, the film is sure to be a must-see for fans of the genre. As filming continues in Wales, it's clear that The Killer Elite is shaping up to be a thrilling addition to the action movie canon.

Cancer fight 'hampered in UK by stiff upper lip',"By Michelle Roberts, Health editor, BBC News online Researchers, who surveyed nearly 20,000 adults in six high-income countries, said they found embarrassment often stopped Britons visiting the doctor, hampering early detection and effective treatment of cancer. The study, published in the journal PLOS One, revealed respondents in the UK were as aware as those in other countries of the early symptoms of common cancers, such as breast, colorectal and prostate. But the researchers from the Universities of Manchester, Leeds and Cambridge said the cultural norm of keeping a ""stiff upper lip"" meant many Britons did not act on their concerns, leading to delays in seeking medical help. The survey, which was carried out between 2014 and 2016, showed 29% of UK adults had avoided seeing a doctor because they were too embarrassed, compared with 17% in Australia, 18% in Canada and 19% in the US. The researchers said the findings contradicted the assumption that people in the UK were more likely to seek medical help than those in other countries because of the National Health Service (NHS). Instead, they suggested the ""stigma and shame"" associated with illness and the belief that it is a sign of weakness to admit to being unwell, were barriers to early cancer diagnosis in the UK. The researchers urged healthcare providers to challenge these attitudes and encourage people to seek help early, to improve their chances of successful treatment. Dr Hayley Whitworth, senior author of the study from the University of Manchester, said: ""Our findings suggest that, despite the NHS being free at the point of use, there is still a significant number of people in the UK who are reluctant to see their doctor when they are concerned about early cancer symptoms."" The researchers also called for more education about cancer and its symptoms, as well as initiatives to encourage open discussions about illness and health. Dr Ranjit Manchanda, consultant gastroenterologist and trustee of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ""It's really important that we encourage people to talk openly about their symptoms and not to be embarrassed about seeking help. The earlier cancer is diagnosed, the better the chances of successful treatment."" He added that people should not wait for symptoms to become unbearable before seeking help, as many cancers can be treated effectively if detected early. The researchers said cultural differences in attitudes to illness and healthcare could have a significant impact on cancer outcomes and called for more research in this area. They also urged policymakers to address the issue of embarrassment and reluctance to seek help, as part of wider efforts to improve early cancer diagnosis and outcomes.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Bangladesh mass prayer event prompts alarm,"Local police chief Tota Miah told AFP news agency that 10,000 Muslims had gathered in Raipur town, Bangladesh, to pray ""healing verses"" from the Koran. But some eyewitnesses told a different story. They described large crowds with only a few masks in sight, disregarding social distancing guidelines and defying the government's ban on mass gatherings to curb the spread of coronavirus. Raipur, located around 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of the capital Dhaka, saw the biggest religious event since the outbreak began in the country. Mohammad Salauddin, an eyewitness, stated that, ""People came from nearby villages and towns. They were not following any safety protocols. It was a huge gathering."" The event, which took place on Monday, comes as Bangladesh battles a surge in COVID-19 cases, with daily infections rising above 4,000 for the first time. The South Asian nation currently has the third-highest tally of COVID-19 cases in the region, with over 641,000 confirmed infections and more than 9,100 fatalities. The Bangladesh Ulema Council, an influential Islamic body, had urged Muslims to perform prayers at home to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the call seemed to have fallen on deaf ears in Raipur. The gathering in Raipur was not an isolated incident, as other parts of the country have also seen large religious events disregarding the health crisis. In the southeastern town of Derai, an annual Muslim pilgrimage was held last week despite warnings from the authorities. The Bangladesh government has issued several directives to limit mass gatherings and imposed strict lockdowns in hotspot areas to curb the spread of COVID-19. The authorities have been urging people to follow health guidelines, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the situation in Bangladesh is ""extremely concerning,"" and called for increased efforts to ensure compliance with preventive measures. Dr. Hanan Botoom, WHO Country Representative to Bangladesh, stated, ""We urge all Bangladeshis to take this seriously and do their part to protect themselves and their loved ones."" The Raipur prayer event has raised concerns not only for the potential spread of the virus but also for the impact it might have on the country's fragile healthcare system.

Welsh Rugby Union pumps record Â£22.1m into game despite profit fall,"Despite the fall in turnover and pre-tax profits for the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in the Six Nations-winning year ending June 2013, the organization still managed to inject a record Â£22.1m into the game. The figures showed a turnover of Â£61m, a decrease from the record-breaking Â£63m turnover in the previous year. Pre-tax profits also saw a slight decrease from Â£2.4m in 2012 to Â£2.3m. However, the WRU's commitment to investing in the game remained unwavering. Chief Executive Officer, Martyn Phillips, spoke about the union's continued financial support for Welsh rugby, stating, ""These financial results demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the WRU to invest in Welsh rugby at all levels. Despite the slight decrease in turnover and profits, we have still been able to pump a record amount of money back into the game."" The WRU's investment strategy focuses on grassroots development, with a significant portion of the funds being used to develop community rugby and schools rugby. Phillips added, ""We remain committed to investing in the future of Welsh rugby. Grassroots rugby is the lifeblood of our game, and we are dedicated to providing the necessary resources to ensure the next generation of players have every opportunity to succeed."" The union also continues to invest in the professional game, with the Welsh national team and the regions receiving significant funding. Phillips stated, ""Our professional teams are the face of Welsh rugby on the international stage, and we are determined to provide them with the best possible resources to compete at the highest level."" The WRU's financial commitment to the game has been recognized by the Welsh Government, with Economy and Transport Minister, Ken Skates, praising the union's investment strategy. ""The Welsh Rugby Union's continued investment in Welsh rugby is to be commended,"" Skates said. ""The game is an integral part of Welsh culture, and it is essential that we provide the necessary resources to ensure its continued success."" The WRU's financial results for the year ending June 2013 also showed an increase in operating expenses, which rose from Â£58.8m in 2012 to Â£60.2m. Phillips attributed the increase to the union's investment in the game and the ongoing development of its commercial activities. Despite the slight decrease in profits, the WRU's record investment in Welsh rugby is a testament to its commitment to the game at all levels. The union's continued financial support is crucial to the development of future generations of Welsh rugby players and the success of the professional teams on the international stage.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China: Limited victory for man in transgender dismissal case,"Mr C, who was born female but identifies and dresses as a man, experienced a setback in his legal battle against discrimination in China last week. Mr C was working at a health centre in Guiyang last year when he was suddenly dismissed. The reason given by the centre's management was that Mr C's appearance and behaviour were not in line with the centre's ""social values."" Mr C took the centre to court, arguing that he had been illegally dismissed based on his gender identity. The court agreed that Mr C had been unfairly terminated but stopped short of delivering a clear victory for transgender rights in China. The court's ruling stated that while it was against the law to discriminate against an employee based on their gender identity, the centre had not explicitly stated that Mr C's gender identity was the reason for his dismissal. Instead, the centre had cited Mr C's appearance and behaviour as the reasons for his termination. The court's decision has left transgender rights advocates in China feeling frustrated and disappointed. While the ruling is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough in addressing the systemic discrimination faced by transgender people in the country. Transgender people in China face significant barriers to employment, education, and healthcare. Discrimination is rampant, and there is a lack of legal protections against it. According to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Transgender Network, over 70% of transgender people in China have experienced discrimination in their workplace. The Chinese government has taken some steps to address transgender discrimination in recent years. In 2017, it issued a document stating that discrimination against transgender people was a violation of the Constitution and that steps should be taken to protect their rights. However, there is still a long way to go. Mr C's case is a reminder of the challenges facing transgender people in China. While the court's ruling is a small step forward, it is not enough to bring about meaningful change. Transgender people in China continue to face significant discrimination, and more needs to be done to protect their rights and ensure they are treated with dignity and respect. The international community has a role to play in pushing for progress on transgender rights in China. Governments, NGOs, and civil society organizations can all play a part in supporting transgender people in China and pressuring the Chinese government to take action. In the meantime, Mr C's case serves as a reminder that progress on transgender rights is not inevitable. It requires sustained effort and advocacy from all of us. Let us continue to speak out against discrimination and support transgender people in their struggle for equality and dignity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Apple ordered to re-write 'inaccurate' Samsung statement,"Apple was forced on 18 October to publish a message on its UK website making it clear that Samsung Electronics had not infringed the registered design of the iPad. The statement was a result of a court order following a legal battle between the two tech giants over design patent rights. However, Samsung complained to the court that the statement Apple had posted did not comply with the court order. According to reports, Samsung believed that the wording of Apple's message could be interpreted as an implication that Samsung's tablets did not copy the iPad's design in other ways, apart from the registered design. The dispute led to Apple being ordered by the court to re-write the statement to make it clearer and more accurate. The revised statement, which was published on the Apple UK website on 25 October, read: ""Samsung's Galaxy Tablet 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 8.9 do not infringe Apple's registered design right in the iPad."" The court order also required Apple to post the revised statement on its websites in Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands for a period of one month. The company was also ordered to publish the statement in three newspapers in each of those countries. The legal battle between Apple and Samsung began in April 2011, when Apple filed a lawsuit against Samsung in the US, alleging that several of Samsung's mobile devices, including the Galaxy Tab, infringed on Apple's design patents and trade dresses for the iPad. The case, which was seen as a major battle between two of the world's leading technology companies, was eventually settled out of court in December 2011, with Samsung agreeing to pay Apple an undisclosed amount in damages. However, the legal disputes between the two companies continued, with Apple filing several lawsuits against Samsung in various jurisdictions over the following years. The dispute over the wording of Apple's statement is just one of the many legal wrangles between the two companies. It highlights the intense competition between Apple and Samsung in the mobile device market and the lengths that both companies are willing to go to protect their intellectual property. The court order also serves as a reminder to businesses of the importance of complying with court orders accurately and promptly. Failure to do so can result in further legal action, additional costs, and damage to a company's reputation. Apple and Samsung have since moved on from their legal disputes, focusing on new products and innovations. However, the legal battle over the iPad's design remains an interesting chapter in the long-running rivalry between the two companies. In the end, the court order and the subsequent dispute over the wording of Apple's statement served as a reminder of the importance of clear and accurate communication, especially in the context of legal disputes. It also highlighted the intense competition between Apple and Samsung and their willingness to protect their intellectual",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Aberdeen sanitary product pilot to start across Scotland,"The Scottish government scheme, designed to tackle ""period poverty"" and ensure that no individual misses out on education or essential activities due to inability to afford menstrual products, was launched in July last year. The six-month pilot, which commenced in Aberdeen, has gained significant momentum and has now been extended to cover the entirety of Scotland. The initiative, which is being hailed as a trailblazer for menstrual equity, has already distributed free menstrual products to over 50,000 individuals across Aberdeen. These products include sanitary pads, tampons, and menstrual cups, which are being made available to those in need, including students, low-income families, and those on benefits. The products are being provided through schools, community centers, and various other organizations. The scheme, which was initially funded by a Â£500,000 Scottish Government grant, has received overwhelming support from both the public and private sectors. Numerous organizations and businesses have pledged to continue funding the initiative beyond the initial six-month period. The extension of the scheme to the rest of Scotland was announced in March by the Scottish Government's Equalities Minister, Pauline McNeill. She stated that the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that ""no one is held back from reaching their potential due to lack of access to menstrual products."" She went on to say that ""period poverty is a real issue that affects many individuals, and we will continue to work to eradicate it from our society."" The Scottish Government's move to tackle period poverty follows similar initiatives in other parts of the world, including India, Kenya, and New Zealand. These countries have also recognized the importance of ensuring access to menstrual products as a fundamental right. The Scottish Government's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, added that ""menstruation is a natural process and should not be a source of shame or stigma. We are proud to be leading the way in ensuring that individuals have access to the products they need, free of charge."" The Scottish Government's commitment to tackling period poverty is a significant step forward in promoting gender equality and ensuring that all individuals have equal opportunities to succeed. The initiative is expected to reduce absenteeism in schools and workplaces and improve overall wellbeing. It is hoped that the success of this Scottish pilot will inspire other governments and organizations to follow suit and implement similar initiatives to eradicate period poverty once and for all. In the words of Pauline McNeill, ""Every girl and woman deserves to have access to menstrual products. It's a basic right, and we will continue to fight for it.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Models from Gerry Anderson's The Investigator up for sale,"The speedboat and sports car, two distinctive pieces of prop machinery from Gerry Anderson's 1973 television show The Investigator, have recently surfaced and are now up for sale. The models, both fitted with Honda 50cc engines, are a testament to the meticulous attention to detail that was a hallmark of Anderson's production company, Century 21. The Investigator, an adventure series following the exploits of insurance investigator Mike Cooper, played by David McCallum, was unfortunately never picked up for a full series run. The pilot episode, which aired on ITV on 26 October 1973, failed to attract a large enough audience, and the show was unceremoniously cancelled. Despite this setback, the production team left no stone unturned in their quest to create a visually stunning and engaging television experience. The speedboat and sports car were two integral parts of this vision. The sleek, silver speedboat, complete with red and white stripes, was used extensively throughout the pilot episode, as Cooper and his team navigated the waters in pursuit of the show's various villains. The boat, which measures approximately 1 metre in length, features working lights, a rotating propeller, and an intricately detailed interior. The sports car, a striking red and blackmodel, was used less frequently but no less effectively. The car, which is approximately 40cm long, boasts working headlights, a steerable front wheel, and a detailed interior. Both models were produced by the expert craftspeople at Derek Meddings Designs, who were responsible for the special effects and model work on many of Anderson's most iconic productions, including Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet. The speedboat and sports car are not only significant relics of The Investigator's brief existence but also a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of the production team. They offer a unique opportunity for collectors and fans of Gerry Anderson's work to own a piece of television history. Whether displayed as centrepieces in a dedicated Anderson collector's room or used as props in their own right, these models are sure to generate interest and intrigue. They serve as a reminder of the potential that The Investigator held and the excitement that it promised, and they continue to capture the imagination of those who were captivated by the show's brief but brilliant run. As theModels from Gerry Anderson's The Investigator up for sale, these pieces of television memorabilia offer a glimpse into the world of a show that might have been and a reminder of the enduring legacy of Gerry Anderson and his team.

New environmental watchdog to get legal teeth after Brexit,"By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst Ministers have announced plans to give the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental laws, making it an independent statutory body after Brexit. The move comes as part of a wider package of environmental legislation designed to replace EU rules in the UK. The OEP was first proposed in the government's 2018 25-year Environment Plan. However, critics argue that the watchdog's powers will be limited without the ability to launch legal action. The new measures aim to address this concern and will bring the OEP more in line with the European Commission's European Environmental Agency (EEA). Environment Secretary George Eustice said: ""The Office for Environmental Protection will be an independent, statutory body, tasked with upholding and enforcing our world-leading environmental standards. These new powers will strengthen the OEP's ability to hold government to account and ensure that we continue to drive up environmental ambition and protect the natural world for future generations."" The OEP's powers will include: - The ability to investigate and take enforcement action against public authorities and private companies that breach environmental laws - The power to issue fines and orders to remedy non-compliance - The authority to take the government to court if necessary to ensure that environmental standards are upheld - A role in setting environmental targets and monitoring progress towards them However, some environmental groups have expressed concern that the OEP's budget and staffing levels will be insufficient to carry out its responsibilities effectively. The RSPB, for example, has called for a significant increase in the OEP's funding and staffing to ensure it can deliver on its mandate. In addition to the OEP, the government has also announced plans for an Environmental Land Management Scheme, which aims to reward farmers for environmental practices, and a new scheme to pay households to install solar panels and insulate their homes. The Environmental Audit Committee, which oversees environmental policy in the House of Commons, has welcomed the government's announcement but stressed the need for adequate resources and independence for the OEP. Committee chairwoman, Rt Hon Philippa Stroud MP, said: ""The Office for Environmental Protection is a crucial part of the government's plans to replace EU environmental protections. It's important that the OEP has the resources, independence and powers it needs to hold both government and businesses to account and deliver real improvements in environmental protection."" The government's proposals are subject to scrutiny by parliament and will need to be approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before they can come into force.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Facebook: Norwich painting-a-day artist 'overwhelmed' by praise,"Nick Chinnery, a humble artist from Norwich, has been sharing his daily watercolor creations on Facebook since the turn of the new year. Each piece captures a different Norwich landmark, from the historic cobbled streets to the iconic cathedrals. The project, which he playfully named ""#365Norwich,"" has taken the local community by storm. Chinnery, who had been painting as a hobby for years, decided to challenge himself with this endeavor to keep his artistic skills sharp. He never anticipated the reaction his posts would garner. ""If you can put into words how I feel, please do,"" he wrote in a recent post, expressing his astonishment at the outpouring of appreciation from his online following. Hundreds of emails have poured in, with messages of encouragement, admiration, and even offers to buy the original pieces. ""It's been overwhelming, really,"" Chinnery shared in an interview. ""I didn't start this project to gain attention or make a profit; I simply wanted to share my love for Norwich and its beauty with others."" The sheer volume of emails has become a challenge in itself for Chinnery, who paints each piece from his home studio and responds to every message personally. ""I'm trying to keep up, but it's becoming a bit much,"" he admitted with a smile. ""I feel like I'm running a one-man art gallery!"" Despite the unexpected hurdles, Chinnery remains dedicated to his project. He wakes up every day before sunrise, brews a cup of tea, and settles in to paint. ""It's my morning ritual,"" he explained. ""I find it soothing and calming, and it helps me start the day on the right foot."" The #365Norwich project has not only brought Chinnery joy but also inspired others in the community. Local businesses have reached out to collaborate, and he's even been invited to give talks at schools and art clubs. ""It's been a fantastic experience,"" he said. ""I've met so many wonderful people, and I've learned that there's a real appetite for art in Norwich."" As the project nears its end, Chinnery is looking forward to what comes next. He plans to compile his paintings into a book and holds hopes of creating an exhibition. ""I'm excited to see where this journey takes me,"" he said. ""I've discovered a whole new world of possibilities, and I can't wait to explore them."" In the meantime, Chinnery continues to paint, one day at a time, sharing his progress and his love for Norwich with the world.

Covid-19: Record day for UK vaccinations as total nears 9m,"As of Saturday, a total of 8,977,329 people had received a Covid-19 vaccine jab in the United Kingdom, and 491,053 of those have had a second dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock took to social media to share the latest vaccination figures, expressing his delight at the progress being made in the country's vaccination programme. The UK's vaccine rollout has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, with an average of over 300,000 jabs administered each day. This week alone, more than one million people have received their first dose, bringing the total number of first doses given to over 8.5 million. The vaccination programme has been expanded to include those aged 45 and over, as well as those with underlying health conditions, and those who live or work in care homes. The government has also announced that all adults in the UK will be offered a first dose of a vaccine by the end of July. Despite the progress being made, there are still challenges to overcome. Supply issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine have led to a temporary reduction in the number of doses being administered, but the government has stressed that there is enough supply to continue the vaccination programme at its current pace. The vaccine rollout has been a source of hope and optimism for many in the UK, who have endured months of lockdowns and restrictions. The latest data suggests that the vaccines are effective in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, and experts believe that the vaccines will help to bring the pandemic under control. However, it is important to remember that vaccines are just one part of the solution. Public health measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and regular hand washing remain crucial in preventing the spread of the virus. As the UK continues to make progress in its vaccination programme, there is a growing sense of optimism that life will soon return to normal. However, there is also a reminder that the fight against Covid-19 is not over yet, and that everyone has a role to play in keeping themselves and their communities safe. In the coming weeks and months, the focus will shift to ensuring that as many people as possible are vaccinated, and that the most vulnerable are prioritised. The government is working with local authorities and community groups to ensure that vaccines are accessible to all, and that there are no barriers to getting vaccinated. As we move towards a post-pandemic world, the vaccines will be a crucial tool in helping to protect the population from the virus. But they are just one part of the solution. It will take all of us working together to ensure that we can finally put this pandemic behind us.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Macron aide Alexandre Benalla to be dismissed after protesters beaten,"The action against Alexandre Benalla, a close aide to French President Emmanuel Macron, was taken after ""new facts"" emerged in the case, French President Emmanuel Macron's office announced on Monday. Benalla, who previously served as a security aide and bodyguard to the president, had been under investigation since footage surfaced in July 2018 showing him violently confronting protesters during May Day demonstrations in Paris. Initially, Macron's office had defended Benalla, stating that he had acted in a ""disproportionate"" but ""isolated"" manner. However, as more information came to light, the president's stance on the matter began to shift. It was revealed that Benalla had been granted a diplomatic passport and assigned to represent France at European Union events, despite being under investigation. The latest development in the case came after the publication of a report by the inspector general for internal security, who found that Benalla had lied to his superiors about his presence at the May Day protests and had used excessive force against the protesters. The report also revealed that Benalla had been involved in other incidents of misconduct, including the theft of a European Parliament badge. In light of these findings, Macron's office announced that Benalla would be dismissed from his position as an advisor to the president, effective immediately. The president also expressed his ""deepest apologies"" to the protesters who had been beaten by Benalla and pledged to take steps to ensure that such incidents would not happen again. Macron's handling of the Benalla case has come under criticism from opposition politicians and some members of the media, who have accused him of attempting to cover up the aide's misconduct and of being out of touch with the French public. The incident has also raised questions about the presidency's handling of security matters and the use of diplomatic passports. In a statement, Macron acknowledged that he bears ""political responsibility"" for the Benalla affair and pledged to take steps to restore public trust. ""I want to assure the French people that I will do everything necessary to restore confidence in the institutions of the Republic,"" he said. The Benalla affair is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the Macron presidency, which has been beset by protests and political challenges since its inception. The president, who came to power in 2017 on a platform of reform and renewal, has struggled to deliver on his promises and has seen his popularity ratings slip. The Benalla case is likely to add to the challenges facing the president as he seeks to navigate the complex political landscape of France.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
South Yorkshire police chief faces MP quiz over sex cases,"It comes after The Times newspaper reported that confidential police reports had referred to widespread abuse of girls by Asian men in South Yorkshire, and Chief Constable David Crompton has been called to appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee of MPs to answer questions about the historical handling of such cases. The Times reported that at least 120 suspected child sex offences were recorded in the area between 1997 and 2002, many of which involved victims as young as 11. The newspaper also claimed that some of the victims were taken to parties where they were abused by multiple men, and that some officers failed to act on the information they received. The Home Affairs Select Committee, which is chaired by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, has invited Chief Constable Crompton to appear before the panel to answer questions about the historical handling of child sexual exploitation cases in South Yorkshire. The invitation comes after the publication of the independent inquiry report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, which found that there were ""clear failures of leadership"" in the police force and local authorities. In a statement, Chief Constable Crompton said that he was ""deeply sorry for the pain and suffering that victims of child sexual exploitation have experienced"", and that he would be ""happy to co-operate fully"" with the Home Affairs Select Committee. But the invitation to Chief Constable Crompton has been met with criticism from some quarters. Labour MP Sarah Champion, who represents Rotherham, has called for him to resign, saying that he was ""not the right person to lead South Yorkshire Police"" and that the force needed ""new leadership"" to rebuild trust with the community. The revelations about historical child sexual exploitation in South Yorkshire come at a time when the issue is once again in the spotlight, following the publication of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report into abuse in Rotherham and other towns. The IICSA report found that thousands of children had been subjected to sexual exploitation in England between 1997 and 2013, and that there had been a ""systemic failure"" to protect them. The issue of child sexual exploitation has also been in the news recently due to the conviction of several high-profile figures, including former Liberal Democrat MP Clement Jenkins and former football coach Barry Bennell. Both men have been convicted of historical child sex offences. The Home Affairs Select Committee is expected to question Chief Constable Crompton about the historical handling of child sexual exploitation cases in South Yorkshire, as well as the current state of the force's response to the issue. The hearing is due to take place in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, South Yorkshire Police have announced that they are launching a review of all historical child sexual exploitation cases to ensure that any mistakes are identified and rectified.

Labour's Brexit plan takes shape,"In an era that had been dominated by centre-right politicians, Labour's Brexit plan was starting to take shape under the leadership of Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour Party, long known for its traditional working-class base, was charting a new course through the post-Brexit landscape. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC Political Editor, observed with keen interest as the party's thinking on Europe evolved. Labour's previous approach to Europe had been characterised by ambiguity and indecision, but under Sir Keir, there was a growing sense of clarity and purpose. Gordon Brown, the last Labour Prime Minister to lead the country during the European Union era, had loved the European project. He had championed the UK's membership of the EU and had pushed for greater integration. Brown's successor, George Osborne, had also relished the benefits of EU membership, seeing it as a means to enhance the City of London's global competitiveness. But as the Brexit referendum approached, Labour had struggled to articulate a clear position. Some in the party had advocated for Remain, while others had backed Leave. The resulting confusion had allowed the Leave campaign to gain momentum, ultimately leading to the UK's departure from the EU. Now, under Sir Keir, Labour was determined to learn from the past. The party was committed to protecting the interests of working-class communities, many of whom had felt neglected by the EU and left behind by globalisation. At the same time, Labour recognised the importance of maintaining close economic and political ties with Europe. Sir Keir's team was working on a comprehensive Brexit plan that sought to strike a balance between these competing priorities. The plan included measures to protect workers' rights and environmental standards, as well as to ensure continued access to the European single market. Labour was also advocating for a close relationship with the EU on issues such as security and foreign policy. The Labour leader was clear that any Brexit deal must be put to a public vote. In a nod to the party's democratic traditions, Sir Keir had pledged to give the people the final say on any agreement reached with the EU. This commitment was designed to prevent the divisive and acrimonious debates that had characterised the Brexit process in the past. As Labour's Brexit plan took shape, the party was starting to attract support from various quarters. Some Labour MPs who had previously advocated for a pro-European stance were warming to the new approach. Meanwhile, many working-class voters who had felt alienated by the EU were beginning to see Labour as a credible alternative. But the road ahead was not going to be easy. The Conservative Party, still deeply divided on Brexit, was likely to present a significant challenge. And the EU, wary of appearing too accommodating to the UK, was unlikely to roll out the red carpet for Labour. Des",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Brit Awards 2018: Stars to wear white rose pins on red carpet,"By Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter The show's organisers wrote to the head of every UK record label on Wednesday to inform them of the plan. The letter, obtained by the BBC, states that performers, presenters, and guests at the Brit Awards 2018 will be given a white rose pin to wear on the red carpet and during the ceremony. The organisers, The British Phonographic Industry (BPI), have not revealed the reason behind the sudden decision. However, it comes as a wave of solidarity for the #MeToo and Time's Up movements sweeps through the entertainment industry. A number of high-profile figures, including actors and musicians, have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent months. The allegations have led to widespread calls for action against sexual harassment and assault. Several women attending the Golden Globe Awards earlier this month wore white roses as a symbol of support for the cause. The colour was chosen as a nod to the suffragette movement, which fought for women's right to vote. It is understood that the white rose pins for the Brit Awards were designed and produced by the BPI in collaboration with the Women in Music campaign. The organisation, which aims to promote gender equality in the music industry, has been working closely with the BPI to encourage more female representation on stage and in the recording studios. The Brit Awards ceremony, which will be held at the O2 Arena in London on February 21, is one of the biggest nights in the UK music calendar. Last year's event was attended by a host of stars, including Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, and Drake. The decision to ask attendees to wear white rose pins is a powerful statement of intent from the BPI. It sends a clear message that the music industry is taking the issue of sexual harassment and assault seriously and is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all. The BPI's move follows a similar initiative by the Grammy Awards, which asked attendees to wear white roses or pins as a symbol of solidarity with the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The decision was made in response to the allegations against music mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women. The Brit Awards 2018 promises to be a night of celebration for the best of British music. With the added significance of the white rose pins, it will also be a night of solidarity and commitment to creating a fairer and more inclusive industry for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Zoom sees more growth after 'unprecedented' 2020,"The Californian video conferencing giant, Zoom, has announced expecting sales to surge past the $3.7bn (Â£2.66bn) mark this year, representing a staggering more than 40% increase compared to 2020. The forecast sent shares of the company skyrocketing by over 12% in after-hours trading, further solidifying Zoom's position as a major player in the digital communication market. The unprecedented circumstances of the past year have catapulted Zoom into the limelight, with the pandemic forcing millions of people around the world to adopt remote working and virtual interactions. As a result, the company witnessed a meteoric rise in user base and engagement, with daily meeting participants surging from 10 million in December 2019 to over 300 million in April 2020. The company's revenue growth can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the mass transition to remote work has made video conferencing an essential tool for businesses, enabling them to maintain operations and collaborate effectively in a virtual setting. Zoom's user-friendly interface, coupled with features such as virtual backgrounds and breakout rooms, have made it a preferred choice for many organizations. Another contributing factor is the surge in personal use of the platform for socializing, with friends and families relying on Zoom to stay connected during lockdowns. The company's free video conferencing service has proved particularly popular, allowing users to host virtual gatherings and events. Additionally, Zoom has been quick to capitalize on the demand for virtual events and webinars. The platform has been used to host everything from corporate conferences to music festivals, enabling organizers to reach vast audiences while maintaining social distancing. Despite the impressive growth, Zoom faces numerous challenges as it seeks to maintain momentum. Competition from rivals such as Microsoft Teams and Google Meet is intensifying, with both companies offering similar features and prices. Furthermore, as the pandemic subsides and people return to the office, there are concerns that demand for video conferencing will decrease. However, Zoom remains optimistic, believing that virtual interactions will continue to play a significant role in both personal and professional lives, even post-pandemic. The company's growth trajectory has been further boosted by strategic acquisitions and partnerships. In 2020, Zoom acquired Keybase, a secure messaging and file-sharing service, aiming to strengthen its position in the collaboration space. Additionally, partnerships with major companies such as Salesforce and Google have expanded Zoom's reach and capabilities. In conclusion, Zoom's continued growth in 2021 is a testament to the enduring shift towards virtual interactions and the company's ability to adapt and innovate in a rapidly evolving market.

Coronavirus: MPs debate pet theft law change amid lockdown rise,"They were debating two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence in the House of Commons chamber. Ipswich MP Tom Hunt led the discussion, expressing his deep concern over the rising number of pet theft cases during the coronavirus lockdown. Hunt emphasized that the current legislation does not adequately address pet theft, which he argued is more than just stealing an object. He stated, ""A pet is not just a possession, it is a cherished member of the family. It provides companionship, love, and emotional support, especially during these challenging times."" The Conservative MP also shared some distressing cases that had come to his attention, including a young boy who was left heartbroken when his family's beloved dog was stolen. Hunt added, ""These incidents have a profound impact on victims, many of whom are children. We cannot allow this to continue."" Labour's Shadow Animal Welfare Minister, Kelly Greenshields, supported the call for change, citing an increase in pet theft reports during the lockdown as evidence for the need for new legislation. ""The RSPCA reports a 13% rise in stolen pets since the pandemic began. This is a serious issue that requires our attention,"" she said. The SNP's Deidre Brock questioned why the government was not acting more swiftly on this matter, given the level of public support for the petitions. ""The government must take this issue seriously and bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency,"" she insisted. Minister for Crime and Policing, Kit Malthouse, acknowledged the issue and confirmed that the government is considering the matter. ""We understand the concerns raised and are looking at the issue carefully. We will respond in due course,"" he said, without committing to a specific timeline for action. Liberal Democrat MP, Wera Hobhouse, who tabled one of the petitions, urged the government to act now and make pet theft a specific offence, arguing that it would send a strong message to perpetrators that such crimes will not be tolerated. ""This would not only help to deter potential thieves but would also provide some comfort to victims, knowing that the law treats their loss seriously,"" she said. The debate concluded without a clear commitment from the government on when it would act on the issue, but it served to highlight the growing concern over the rise in pet theft during the coronavirus lockdown and the need for change in the law. The petitions, which have garnered widespread support, will continue to put pressure on the government to take action and make pet theft a specific offence.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Alcohol age rise plan rejected,"The SNP administration's latest attempt to tighten Scotland's alcohol laws has been thwarted, as Holyrood's health committee rejected a proposal that would have given local licensing boards the power to ban off-licence sales to under-21s. This is the latest setback for the Scottish government's Alcohol Bill, which has faced opposition from various quarters since its introduction last year. Last week, the Scottish Parliament's health committee heard evidence on the proposed amendment, which was supported by the Scottish Government and the Alcohol Health Alliance. The aim was to prevent young people from purchasing alcohol in off-licence premises, thereby reducing underage drinking and associated harms. However, Labour and Liberal Democrat members of the committee raised concerns about the potential impact on small businesses and the practicality of enforcing such a ban. Scottish Health Secretary, Humza Yousaf, expressed his disappointment at the committee's decision. ""I am deeply disappointed that the health committee has rejected this important amendment. Young people are being failed by the current system, which allows them to buy alcohol in off-licences and drink it in public places,"" he said. ""We need to do more to protect our young people from the harms of alcohol and this amendment would have been an important step in that direction."" The Scottish Labour Party, which opposes the Alcohol Bill in its entirety, welcomed the committee's decision. Monica Lennon, the party's equalities spokesperson, said, ""This amendment would have unfairly targeted small businesses and imposed additional burdens on already stretched police resources. Instead of focusing on punitive measures, we need to focus on preventing alcohol-related harm through education, support and evidence-based policies."" The Scottish Grocers' Federation, which represents small retailers, also welcomed the decision. Chief executive Pete Cheema said, ""This amendment would have had a disproportionate impact on small retailers, particularly those in deprived areas. It would have created confusion for retailers and enforcement agencies, and could have led to more harm than good."" The Scottish Government has yet to announce whether it will bring the amendment back for a vote in the full Parliament. The Alcohol Bill, which includes measures such as minimum pricing and extended opening hours for off-licences, has been criticised by some as an overreach by the government. However, supporters argue that it is necessary to address Scotland's high rates of alcohol-related harm, which cost the NHS an estimated Â£375 million each year. The rejection of the under-21 sales ban is a blow to the Scottish Government's efforts to tackle underage drinking and associated harms. However, the debate is far from over, and it remains to be seen whether the government will be able to push the bill through in its current form or whether it will face further setbacks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
RBS stands by branch closure decision,"MPs on a Westminster committee expressed their deep concerns over RBS's decision to close 62 branches in Scotland, stating that the reaction from the public was ""overwhelmingly negative."" The committee, which focuses on Scottish affairs, heard testimonies from individuals and organizations who felt strongly affected by the bank's plans. One of the main concerns raised during the hearing was the impact on customers in rural areas. These communities, often remote and with limited access to other banking services, heavily rely on RBS branches for their financial needs. The closure of these branches would force customers to travel long distances to access their accounts, or to rely on alternative, potentially more costly, services. RBS, which is based in Edinburgh, argued that the majority of its customers now use digital banking channels, and that the branches earmarked for closure were underutilized. However, the MPs were unconvinced, pointing out that many customers, particularly older people and those in rural areas, do not have the digital capabilities or confidence to use online banking. The committee also questioned RBS's commitment to its responsibility as a publicly-owned institution, given that it was bailed out during the financial crisis. They argued that the bank had a moral obligation to maintain a network of branches that served the needs of all its customers, particularly those in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. RBS responded by stating that it would provide additional support and resources to help customers make the transition to digital banking. This would include face-to-face assistance at post offices and other community locations, as well as the provision of tablets and other digital devices. However, critics pointed out that this would not solve the underlying problem of long-term access to banking services for those in rural areas. The committee called on the UK government to intervene and to ensure that RBS reconsiders its decision to close the branches. They argued that the closure would have a significant impact on local communities and on the economy as a whole. The MPs also urged RBS to engage more openly with its customers and to listen to their concerns, rather than simply imposing its plans on them. The debate over RBS's branch closure plans is far from over. The committee's report on the issue is expected to be published in the coming weeks, and it is likely that the issue will continue to be a topic of heated discussion in the Scottish Parliament and beyond. In the meantime, customers in rural areas and their representatives are urging RBS to think again and to find a solution that does not leave them feeling let down.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus testing urged over pub outbreak in Stone,"In a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus, health officials in Staffordshire have urged anyone who visited the Crown and Anchor pub in Stone between July 16 and 18 to get tested, following a confirmed case of COVID-19. The individual, who tested positive after being at the pub, is now self-isolating and contact tracing is underway to identify and notify those who may have been in close contact with them. Dr Johnny McMahon, Director of Public Health for Staffordshire, said, ""We are working closely with the pub to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with the confirmed case. We are urging anyone who was at the Crown and Anchor between July 16 and 18 to get tested, even if they don't have any symptoms. This will help us to identify any potential cases early and prevent further transmission of the virus."" The pub, which is located in the heart of Stone town centre, has confirmed that they are fully cooperating with health officials and have taken steps to deep clean the premises. The news comes as the number of coronavirus cases in Staffordshire continues to rise, with the county recording a total of 1,234 cases as of July 21. The pub outbreak serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to social distancing guidelines and wearing face masks in enclosed spaces, particularly when it is not possible to maintain a 2 metre distance from others. Dr McMahon added, ""We know that the vast majority of people in Staffordshire are following the guidelines and doing their bit to protect themselves and others. However, this outbreak serves as a reminder that the virus is still circulating in our communities and that we all have a responsibility to take precautions to prevent its spread. I would urge everyone to continue to follow the guidance, including wearing face masks in enclosed spaces, maintaining social distancing, and washing their hands regularly."" Anyone who was at the Crown and Anchor between July 16 and 18 and wish to get tested can do so by calling 119 or booking an appointment online at www.nhs.uk/coronavirus. Testing is free and available to anyone, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. The pub has also issued a statement, saying, ""We are working closely with the health authorities to identify anyone who may have been affected. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and staff is our top priority, and we will continue to follow all government guidance to ensure that our pub is a safe environment for everyone.""

Polish bishops for total ban on Sunday shopping,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring: Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki, the primate of Poland, has called for a total ban on shopping on Sundays, arguing that everyone, regardless of their religious beliefs, needs a day of rest. The proposal was made ahead of a meeting of the Polish Bishops Conference on Friday. ""Free Sundays are what all Catholics, non-Catholics and non-believers need,"" Archbishop Gadecki told Polish Radio. ""It's not just a Catholic issue, it's a human right and a social issue."" The archbishop's comments come as the Polish bishops prepare to debate a proposal to ban Sunday shopping. If passed, the ban would apply to all shops, including those in large shopping malls. Some exceptions, such as pharmacies and petrol stations, might be made. The idea of a Sunday shopping ban is not new to Poland. Similar proposals have been made in the past, but they have never gained enough support to be implemented. The latest push comes as the Polish economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, with many shops reporting strong sales. Supporters of the ban argue that it would give people a chance to rest and spend time with their families. They also point out that many workers are forced to work on Sundays, which can lead to fatigue and health problems. However, opponents of the ban argue that it would harm businesses and consumers. They point out that many people rely on Sundays to do their shopping, and that a ban would force them to travel to neighbouring countries to make purchases. The issue is likely to be a contentious one, with strong opinions on both sides. The Polish Bishops Conference is expected to issue a statement on the issue after its meeting on Friday. In the meantime, Archbishop Gadecki has called on Poles to support the idea of a Sunday shopping ban. ""I urge all Polish citizens to defend this idea, because a day of rest is not a luxury, but a necessity for every human being,"" he said. The archbishop's comments have received a mixed reaction from the public. Some have praised his stance as a principled stand in defence of the human need for rest, while others have criticised him for interfering in matters that are beyond the remit of the Church. Regardless of the outcome of the debate, it is clear that the issue of Sunday shopping is one that touches on deeply held beliefs about work, rest, and the role of the Church in Polish society. It is also a reminder that, despite the economic and social changes that have taken place in Poland over the past three decades, some fundamental questions about the nature of work and the meaning of leisure remain unanswered. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the issue of Sunday shopping is not just about shopping.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sex robots may cause psychological damage,"By Pallab Ghosh, Science correspondent, Seattle The world of sex robots is expanding at a rapid pace, with manufacturers promising increasingly lifelike and interactive companions. But behind the veneer of advanced technology and personalised experiences, some scientists are raising concerns about the potential psychological damage these devices could cause. The robots, which can cost thousands of dollars, are marketed as being customisable and capable of meeting the user's every desire. They can be programmed to make specific noises, respond to voice commands, and even mimic human emotions. But this hyper-realistic experience could have negative consequences for some users, according to Dr Susan Quilliam, a psychologist based in the UK. ""There is a risk that people could become overly reliant on these robots for intimacy, leading to a distortion of their expectations and experiences of real human relationships,"" she explains. ""This could result in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and even depression."" The potential psychological risks of sex robots are not just limited to those who use them regularly. Dr Quilliam also warns about the impact on those who are unable to afford them. ""There is a danger that the use of sex robots could widen the gap between those who have access to this technology and those who don't,"" she says. ""This could lead to further feelings of exclusion and isolation for those who are unable to afford them."" Despite these concerns, the technology is escaping oversight because regulatory agencies are too embarrassed to investigate it, according to Dr Kate Devlin, a senior lecturer in Digital Media and Culture at Goldsmiths, University of London. ""There is a culture of shame and stigma surrounding the use of sex robots and other forms of adult entertainment technology,"" she explains. ""This means that there is a lack of regulation and oversight, which could lead to serious consequences for some users."" Dr Devlin is calling for action to be taken to prevent the potential harm caused by sex robots. She believes that regulatory bodies need to take a more balanced and open-minded approach to the technology. ""We need to have a serious conversation about the potential risks and benefits of sex robots,"" she says. ""We need to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect users from harm, while also respecting their right to privacy and autonomy."" The development of sex robots is not just a concern for psychologists and regulators, but also for those who work in the industry. Dr Hiroshi Ishiguro, a robotics researcher based in Japan, who has developed a robot that looks and behaves like himself, is one of them. ""I understand the appeal of sex robots, but I also think that we need to be responsible in how we develop and market this technology,"" he says.

Coronavirus: UK's already huge changes may just be the start,"Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurakitchenwindow Whitehall had been monitoring and fearing the arrival of the coronavirus on these shores for many weeks. But when Boris Johnson told us not so long ago that we would face a ""significant disruption"" to our daily lives, few could have imagined the scale of the changes that were about to unfold. As the Prime Minister's words echoed in our minds, the pace of events accelerated. Schools closed their doors, offices emptied, and the streets grew increasingly deserted. Britons were urged to work from home if they could, and to avoid non-essential travel and social gatherings. The government announced a package of measures to support businesses and workers, as the economic impact of the pandemic became increasingly apparent. But even as the UK's response to the crisis evolved, it became clear that the changes we were seeing were just the beginning. The virus continued to spread, and the number of cases and deaths grew exponentially. The NHS, already under pressure from years of austerity, was stretched to its limits. And as the situation worsened, the government was forced to take increasingly drastic measures to try and slow the spread of the virus. In the coming days and weeks, the UK would see its streets filled with armed soldiers, its parks transformed into makeshift hospitals, and its skies filled with planes repatriating stranded citizens. The economic impact of the crisis would be felt in every corner of the country, as businesses closed their doors and millions of people found themselves out of work. And yet, even as the challenges grew more daunting, there were signs of hope. Neighbours came together to support one another, volunteering to help the vulnerable and delivering essential supplies to those in need. Communities rallied around their local hospitals, cheering for healthcare workers and offering words of encouragement and appreciation. And as the weeks turned to months, the UK began to adapt to its new reality. Schools and workplaces experimented with new ways of operating, allowing for social distancing and remote working. New technologies emerged to help people stay connected, and communities came together in new and innovative ways. But even as we looked to the future, it was clear that the changes we had seen were just the beginning. The world had been forever altered by the coronavirus, and the UK would need to continue to adapt and evolve if it was to thrive in this new reality. The road ahead would be long and difficult, but with determination, resilience, and a little bit of British grit, we would get through it together.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Yushchenko testifies against old Orange ally Tymoshenko,"Mrs Tymoshenko is being tried in Kiev on charges of exceeding her authority while prime minister, in signing a gas agreement with Russia in 2009. The trial, which began in September 2011, has been described as politically motivated by Tymoshenko and her supporters. Yulia Tymoshenko, a key figure in the Orange Revolution that brought Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2004, denies any wrongdoing and has accused the current government of persecution. On Tuesday, her former ally and fellow revolutionary, Viktor Yushchenko, testified against her in court. Yushchenko, who served as president from 2005 to 2010, was a key player in the negotiations that led to the gas deal with Russia. He told the court that Tymoshenko had pressured him to sign the agreement and had threatened to resign if he did not. Yushchenko's testimony was a dramatic turn of events in the trial. Tymoshenko, who is currently being held in a prison hospital due to health issues, has always maintained that she acted in the best interests of Ukraine during the negotiations. She has accused Yushchenko of betraying their revolutionary ideals and of making a deal that was unfavourable to Ukraine. The gas agreement, which was signed in January 2009, was controversial at the time and was criticised by some as being too favourable to Russia. It gave Moscow a 33% discount on gas supplies in exchange for a 15-year extension of the lease on the Russian-owned gas transit system through Ukraine. Critics argued that Ukraine could have negotiated a better deal and that the agreement was a blow to Ukraine's sovereignty. Yushchenko's testimony has renewed calls for the case against Tymoshenko to be dropped. Her supporters argue that the charges are politically motivated and that she is being persecuted for her political views. They point to the fact that other high-ranking officials involved in the negotiations, including Yushchenko himself, have not been charged. The trial is being closely watched both in Ukraine and internationally. The European Union, which has observer mission at the trial, has expressed concern over the fairness of the proceedings and has called for Tymoshenko to be released if she is found guilty and given a fair retrial. The United States has also criticised the trial and has called for Tymoshenko to be released. Despite the controversy surrounding the trial, it is clear that the gas deal signed in 2009 remains a contentious issue in Ukrainian politics. The negotiations were a turning point in Ukraine's relations with Russia and highlighted the challenges that Ukraine faces in balancing its relations with its eastern neighbour and the West.

Greater Anglia apologises over London to Norwich train disruption,"Services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich were disrupted in both directions on Tuesday evening after a train came to a halt, blocking the line near Chelmsford. The incident caused significant delays for passengers travelling between the two cities, with some reporting waits of up to five hours. The train, which was travelling from Norwich to London, came to a stop around 7pm due to a fault with the signalling system, according to Abellio Greater Anglia. The failure resulted in the line being blocked, causing disruption to trains in both directions. Passengers were left stranded on the train for hours, with many taking to social media to express their frustration and disappointment. ""I've been stuck on this train for hours with no updates or communication from staff,"" one passenger tweeted. ""I have a meeting in the morning that I can't miss and this is unacceptable."" Another passenger reported that they had been told the train would be moving again soon, only for the information to be incorrect. ""We've been given false information several times now,"" they said. ""It's a complete chaos."" Abellio Greater Anglia apologised for the delays and disruption caused, assuring passengers that they were working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. ""We apologise for the delays caused by the disruption to services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich,"" a spokesperson for the railway company said. ""We understand the frustration and inconvenience this will cause our passengers and we are doing everything we can to get services back to normal as soon as possible."" The railway company urged passengers to check their journey before travelling and advised them to consider using alternative routes. ""We would like to advise passengers to check their journey before travelling and consider using alternative routes if possible,"" the spokesperson added. As of 10pm, services between London Liverpool Street and Norwich were still disrupted in both directions, with delays and cancellations expected to continue into the early hours of the morning. Abellio Greater Anglia urged passengers to check their journey regularly for updates and to plan their travel accordingly. The disruption comes just weeks after Greater Anglia faced criticism over delays and cancellations during the Easter holidays. The railway company has been under pressure to improve its services following a number of high-profile incidents, including a fatal collision near Ipswich in February 2019. Passengers affected by the disruption were entitled to compensation, according to Abellio Greater Anglia.

Dutch state liable for three Srebrenica deaths - court,"The men had been ordered to leave a UN compound run by Dutch peacekeeping forces when Bosnian Serb forces overran it in July 1995. Numerous reports and testimonies have long suggested that these men, who were predominantly Bosniak Muslim, were handed over to their captors and subsequently executed. Now, a Dutch court has ruled that the Dutch state is indeed liable for the deaths of at least three of these men. The ruling, handed down by the District Court of The Hague on March 30, 2023, came after a long and complicated legal process. The men's families, represented by the Dutch Legal Centre for the Prevention of Torture (CLM), brought the case against the Dutch state in 2019. The hearing, which was held in camera due to the sensitive nature of the case, lasted for several days. The court found that the Dutch battalion, which was part of the UN's Dutchbat contingent, had a duty of care towards the men when they were inside the compound. The Dutchbat troops had been informed that Bosnian Serb forces were advancing on the compound and ordered the men to leave, despite knowing that doing so would likely place them in great danger. The court ruled that the Dutch state had breached its duty of care by allowing the men to leave without providing them with adequate protection. The ruling is a significant development in the long-running controversy surrounding the Dutchbat's role in the Srebrenica massacre. The UN compound in Potocari, where the men were housed, was the only area in Srebrenica that was technically still under UN protection. Thousands of Bosniak men and boys were taken from the area and executed by Bosnian Serb forces in the weeks following the overrunning of the compound. The ruling does not absolve the Dutch state of all responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre, but it is a step towards acknowledging the role Dutch peacekeeping forces played in the events of July 1995. The families of the men who were killed have welcomed the ruling as a recognition of the suffering they have endured for over 25 years. However, the ruling also raises questions about the limitations of international law and the role of peacekeeping forces in times of conflict. The Dutch state has indicated that it will appeal the ruling, and the case is likely to go through a lengthy appeals process. In the meantime, the families of the deceased men will continue to seek justice and closure for the loss of their loved ones. As the world marks the 28th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre on July 11, 2023, the ruling serves as a reminder of the ongoing quest for accountability and justice for the victims and their families.

"North needs Â£50bn to close gap with south, report claims","IPPR North, the think tank dedicated to economic and social issues in the northern regions of England, has released a report claiming that the North of England needs an investment of approximately Â£50 billion to close the gap with the South and make the government's Northern Powerhouse strategy a reality. The analysis focused on infrastructure, productivity, and public services. The report highlights that while the North has seen some progress in recent years, with cities like Manchester and Leeds experiencing economic growth, the region as a whole still lags behind the South. The North's productivity levels are lower, and its infrastructure is less developed. The report argues that to bridge this gap, the government needs to make a significant investment in the North. The report calls for investment in transport infrastructure, particularly in rail and roads. It argues that better transport links would make the North more attractive to businesses and investors, and would also make it easier for people to commute between different parts of the region. The report also calls for investment in digital infrastructure, arguing that better broadband and mobile coverage would help to boost productivity and create new opportunities for businesses. The report also highlights the need for investment in public services, particularly in areas like health and education. It argues that the North has been underfunded for too long, and that this has led to poorer health outcomes and lower educational attainment. The report calls on the government to invest in these areas to help improve the quality of life for people in the North. The report also calls for a step-change in the government's commitment to the Northern Powerhouse. It argues that while the government has made some positive noises about the Northern Powerhouse, it has not yet put in place the policies and investment needed to make it a reality. The report calls on the government to make the Northern Powerhouse a priority, and to work in partnership with local leaders and businesses to make it a success. The report's findings have been welcomed by many in the North, who have long argued that the region needs more investment to help it compete with the South. However, some have questioned whether the government has the political will to make such a significant investment in the North. Others have argued that the money would be better spent on other areas, such as the NHS or social care. Despite these concerns, the report's findings are a reminder that the North still has a long way to go before it can truly compete with the South. If the government is serious about its Northern Powerhouse strategy, it will need to invest significantly in the region and make a commitment to working in partnership with local leaders and businesses to make it a success. Only then can the North hope to close the gap with the South and unlock its full potential.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"JJB Sports in administration with 2,200 job losses","The administrators of JJB Sports, the embattled retailer with a long-standing presence on the High Street, announced on Tuesday that they had managed to save 550 jobs after selling part of the business to Sports Direct. The deal, which saw the sports retailing giant take ownership of JJB's loss-making stores, marked a significant step in the winding-up process that was initiated in April 2012. However, the news was not all positive. The administrators, KPMG, confirmed that a total of 2,200 jobs would be lost as part of the restructuring plan. The majority of these losses were expected to affect the Head Office staff and the 149 JJB stores that were not included in the sale to Mike Ashley's Sports Direct. In a statement, the joint administrators, Philip Duffy and Nick Harris, said: ""We have worked tirelessly to secure a future for JJB Sports and are pleased to have reached an agreement with Sports Direct. This sale will provide a platform for the ongoing trading of JJB Sports and safeguard the jobs of a significant number of employees."" Despite the positive news, the future of JJB Sports remains uncertain. The company has been struggling to maintain profitability in the face of increasing competition from larger retailers and the shift towards online shopping. The sale to Sports Direct is seen as a last-ditch effort to keep the business alive, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to turn around JJB's fortunes. The announcement of the job losses came as a blow to the hundreds of employees who were already facing an uncertain future. Unions representing JJB staff expressed their disappointment and called on the government to do more to support workers in the retail sector. ""This is a devastating blow for JJB's employees, many of whom have dedicated their careers to the company,"" said Bernard McAuley, the national officer for the Usdaw union. ""We are calling on the government to do more to support retail workers who are facing redundancy or uncertain futures."" The news of JJB's troubles came as a reminder of the challenges facing the retail sector in the current economic climate. With rising prices, low consumer confidence and increasing competition, many retailers are struggling to stay afloat. The fate of JJB Sports serves as a warning of the challenges that lie ahead for the industry as a whole. Despite the uncertainty, the administrators remain optimistic that the sale to Sports Direct will provide a platform for the ongoing trading of JJB Sports.

Northern Ireland earnings on the rise,"By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor That means typical weekly pay in Northern Ireland rose from Â£500 to Â£521, or just over Â£27,000 a year. This puts Northern Ireland and the West Midlands among the regions in the UK where earnings have increased the most in the past year. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the increase in Northern Ireland was the fifth highest of all the UK's regions and nations. The West Midlands saw a similar increase, with typical weekly earnings rising from Â£517 to Â£536. The news is a welcome boost for workers in Northern Ireland, who have endured years of economic stagnation and high unemployment. Unemployment in the region remains above the UK average, and wages have lagged behind other parts of the UK for decades. But there are signs that the situation is improving. The Northern Ireland economy grew by 1.3% in 2019, the fastest rate in a decade. And the unemployment rate has fallen to 2.9%, its lowest level since 2006. The increase in wages is being driven by a number of factors, including a growing economy, a shortage of labour in some sectors, and increased investment in the region. ""This is great news for workers in Northern Ireland,"" said John McAllister, an economist with Ulster Bank. ""For too long, wages in the region have lagged behind the rest of the UK. But with the economy growing and unemployment falling, we're starting to see wages catch up."" The increase in wages is likely to have a positive impact on the Northern Ireland economy as a whole. Higher wages mean more disposable income for workers, which in turn means more spending on goods and services. This can lead to increased economic activity and further job creation. However, there are also concerns that the increase in wages could lead to inflation. If wages rise faster than the rate of economic growth, it can lead to inflationary pressures, which can in turn lead to higher interest rates and reduced economic activity. The Northern Ireland economy is still facing a number of challenges, including Brexit uncertainty and a lack of investment in key areas such as infrastructure. But the increase in wages is a positive sign that the region is on the right track. ""We still have a long way to go,"" said Dr Esmond Birnie, an economist with Queen's University Belfast. ""But this is a good start. We need to continue to invest in the economy, create jobs, and attract investment. And we need to ensure that the benefits of any economic growth are shared fairly across the population."" Despite the challenges, there is a sense of optimism in Northern Ireland. The region is beginning to reap the rewards of years of hard work and investment. And with the economy growing and wages on the rise, there is",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Donald Trump reverses plans for flavoured e-cigarette ban,"He announced plans for a ban on flavored e-cigarettes in September, citing concerns over the rising number of vaping-related illnesses and deaths. However, according to multiple reports, President Donald Trump has decided not to enact the ban this month. Thousands of jobs in the vaping industry could be at risk, and there have been significant pushbacks from voters and industry groups. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was set to finalize a rule that would have effectively banned the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes, except for tobacco and menthol flavors. This move was seen as a major step in addressing the youth vaping epidemic, as flavors such as fruit and dessert have been popular among young people. However, the ban faced strong opposition from the vaping industry and its supporters. They argued that a flavored e-cigarette ban would put small businesses out of business and lead to job losses. According to the American Vaping Association, there are over 1,100 vape shops in states that could be affected by the ban, and each shop employs an average of 10 people. There were also concerns from voters, particularly in states where the vaping industry is a significant employer. For instance, in Kentucky, where the vaping industry employs around 5,000 people, Governor Andy Beshear urged Trump to reconsider the ban. ""I'm asking you to reconsider this ban because it would devastate our commonwealth,"" he said in a statement. The FDA has not yet commented on the reports of the ban being delayed or dropped. However, some experts believe that the administration may instead focus on other measures to address the youth vaping epidemic, such as increasing enforcement actions against retailers who sell e-cigarettes to minors, or implementing educational campaigns. Meanwhile, public health advocates have expressed disappointment over the reported delay or cancellation of the ban. ""The vaping industry has spent millions of dollars on lobbying and misinformation, and it looks like their efforts have paid off,"" said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ""This is a missed opportunity to save lives and prevent a generation of kids from becoming addicted to nicotine."" The situation remains fluid, and it is unclear what the next steps will be. However, one thing is clear: the debate over e-cigarettes and their role in public health is far from over.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Glasgow Council gender pay dispute has been a long battle,"By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland local government correspondent Many similar claims have been settled across Scotland in recent years, but the Glasgow City Council gender pay dispute was proving more significant. The council, Scotland's largest local authority, had been locked in a protracted battle with trade unions over equal pay for women. At its heart was a complex issue: the way the council's pay structure was calculated meant that many women employed in traditionally female roles, such as care workers and cleaners, were being paid less than their male counterparts in male-dominated roles. The dispute had been simmering for years, and tensions came to a head in 2017 when the council proposed changes to the way it determined pay bands. The Unison, Unite and GMB unions, representing thousands of council employees, argued that the changes would only worsen the gender pay gap. They called for a fairer system, one that would recognise the value of women's work and bring pay levels in line with those of comparable male roles. The dispute escalated into a full-blown industrial action, with thousands of council workers taking to the picket lines. The scene outside Glasgow City Chambers was a regular feature of the morning and afternoon rush hours, as demonstrators held up placards and chanted slogans. The disruption caused by the strikes was significant. Schools were closed, bins were piling up in the streets, and other essential services were affected. The council, for its part, maintained that it was acting in good faith and that the changes were necessary to bring pay structures into line with national standards. But the unions were not alone in their criticism. The Scottish Government, which has the power to intervene in local authority pay disputes, waded into the fray. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for a resolution to the dispute, warning that the continuation of strikes would only harm those they were intended to protect. The council, meanwhile, continued to dig in its heels. It tried to impose a settlement on the unions, but this was met with resistance. A series of mediated talks followed, but no agreement was reached. As the dispute dragged on, it became clear that a resolution would not be easy to come by. The issue was not just about money, but about recognition of the value of women's work and the need for a fairer pay structure. The dispute entered its third year in 2019, with no end in sight. The council and unions remained at loggerheads, and the strikes continued. The impact on services and the public was significant, and the cost to the council, in terms of lost productivity and damage to its reputation, was substantial. The Glasgow City Council gender pay dispute was a long and bitter battle, one that highlighted the need for a fairer pay structure and the value of women's work.

Trial raises Parkinson's therapy hope,"The Japanese team, comprised of researchers from the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, has made a significant breakthrough in the field of Parkinson's disease research. Their latest study, published in the journal ""Nature Communications,"" could potentially lead to new and effective therapies for this debilitating condition. Parkinson's disease causes the progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, resulting in motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with movement. Currently, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, and treatments focus mainly on managing symptoms through medication or deep brain stimulation. The Japanese team has identified a new approach to treating Parkinson's disease using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. iPS cells are derived from adult cells, such as skin or blood cells, and reprogrammed to have the ability to develop into any cell type in the body. In this study, the researchers used iPS cells to create dopamine-producing neurons that were then transplanted into mice with Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. The results were promising. The transplanted neurons survived and integrated into the host brain, and the mice showed improved motor function. The team also found that the transplanted neurons produced dopamine, which is essential for normal movement. The researchers believe that their work could lead to stem cell trials in human patients before the end of 2018. They plan to conduct additional research to ensure the safety and efficacy of this therapy before moving on to human trials. ""We are very excited about the potential of this therapy,"" said Dr. Makoto Murai, the lead researcher on the study. ""We believe that iPS cell-derived dopamine neurons could provide a viable treatment option for Parkinson's disease patients."" The team's discovery has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat Parkinson's disease. While there are currently FDA-approved stem cell therapies for certain conditions, such as certain types of anemia and certain eye diseases, there are no approved stem cell therapies for neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease. The use of iPS cells in Parkinson's disease research is a significant step forward. The ability to create dopamine-producing neurons from a patient's own cells eliminates the need for donor matching, which is a major challenge in current cell transplantation therapies. Additionally, iPS cells offer the potential to create an unlimited supply of cells for transplantation, which could address the limited supply of donor cells currently available. The Japanese team's discovery has sparked great interest in the scientific community, and other research teams are also exploring the use of iPS cells in Parkinson's disease research. The potential for this therapy to provide a viable treatment option for Parkinson's disease patients is a source of",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Royal Liverpool Hospital: Structural flaws at Â£335m hospital,"Building work at the already delayed new Royal Liverpool Hospital was halted in February last year after Carillion's collapse. The construction company's insolvency left the Â£335m project in limbo, with the NHS Trust and the government scrambling to find a solution. Now, more than a year later, the structural flaws at the hospital are coming to light, casting a shadow over the future of the project. A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has highlighted a number of issues with the way the hospital was designed and built, which could lead to significant costs for the taxpayer. The NAO report, which was published earlier this week, found that there were ""deficiencies in the design and installation of the external cladding system"" at the hospital. The cladding is a crucial part of the building's exterior, providing insulation and protection against the elements. But at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, the cladding was not installed correctly, leaving gaps and weaknesses that could allow water to penetrate the building. The report also criticised the way the project was procured, with the government's decision to award the contract to Carillion contributing to the problems. The NAO found that the contract was awarded without a competitive tender process, and that the government did not adequately assess the financial health of Carillion before signing the deal. The hospital was due to open in 2017, but the delays and cost overruns mean that it is still not ready. The NHS Trust is now working to find a solution to the cladding issue, but it is unclear how long and how expensive the fix will be. The NAO report is the latest in a series of setbacks for the hospital project. In 2018, it was revealed that the hospital's boilers were not fit for purpose, and that the hospital would need to rely on temporary solutions until new ones could be installed. The delays and cost overruns at the Royal Liverpool Hospital are a stark reminder of the risks associated with large-scale construction projects. The government and the NHS Trust must now work to address the structural flaws and ensure that the hospital is completed as soon as possible, without compromising patient safety. The NAO report also calls on the government to learn lessons from the Royal Liverpool Hospital experience, and to improve the way it procures and manages major construction projects in the future. With the government's infrastructure pipeline brimming with multi-billion pound projects, this is a message that cannot be ignored. In the meantime, patients in Liverpool continue to wait for the new hospital to open its doors. They deserve better than the delays, the cost overruns, and the structural flaws that have plagued this project so far. It is time for those in charge to take action and deliver the hospital that the city needs.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Facebook testing 'downvote' button,"However, the social network denied that the new feature was a ""dislike"" button, which many Facebook users have requested. The downvote button is being tried out by a small number of US users as part of an experiment to improve the quality of comments on the platform. The company also emphasized that the downvote button is not a dislike button, but rather a tool for users to signal inappropriate or offensive content. When a user downvotes a comment, the post will be hidden from their view and sent to Facebook for review. The social media giant stressed that this is an optional feature, and users will still be able to see all comments on a post if they choose to. Facebook has been testing various ways to improve the commenting experience on its platform. In the past, the company has experimented with features like threaded replies, emojis, and the ability to reply directly to specific comments. The downvote button is the latest iteration of these efforts. However, some users have expressed concern about the potential negative consequences of the downvote button. They argue that it could be used to silence opposing views or bully other users. Facebook acknowledged these concerns and emphasized that the feature is intended to be used responsibly. ""We understand that this is a significant change, and we're approach this carefully,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. ""We're working to make Facebook a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves and having conversations. The downvote button is part of that effort."" The social network also stressed that it will be closely monitoring the feedback from users who are part of the experiment and making adjustments as necessary. It's unclear at this point when or if the downvote button will be rolled out more widely. Despite the controversy surrounding the feature, some users are excited about the potential benefits of the downvote button. They argue that it could help to reduce the amount of offensive or abusive content on the platform and make the commenting experience more positive. ""I think it's a great idea,"" said one Facebook user. ""It will help to weed out the trolls and make the platform a more enjoyable place to be."" Others are more skeptical, however, and worry about the potential for misuse. Only time will tell whether the downvote button will be a success or a failed experiment.

Fishermen's fears over wind farm off County Down coast,"By Julian O'Neill, BBC NI business correspondent A consortium, First Flight Wind, is behind the project that could see up to 100 turbines constructed off the south-east coast of County Down, Northern Ireland. The proposed wind farm, known as the ""Moyle 2"" project, has been met with both excitement and apprehension from various stakeholders. While renewable energy advocates hail it as a significant step towards a cleaner future, local fishermen express concerns about the potential impact on their livelihoods and traditional fishing methods. The Moyle 2 wind farm is planned for the Irish Sea, approximately 14 kilometers off the County Down coast. The project, which is currently in its early stages, has generated much discussion and debate amongst the local fishing community. According to the Northern Ireland Fishermen's Association (NIFA), up to 300 local fishermen could be affected by the wind farm's construction and operation. Gerard O'Flynn, NIFA's chief executive, shares the fishermen's fears, stating that ""the placement of the wind turbines in this area could significantly hinder traditional fishing methods, particularly for those who rely on static gear such as pots and traps."" He also expresses concern about the potential displacement of fish from their natural habitats as a result of the construction and ongoing operation of the wind farm. Fishermen in the area are particularly worried about the impact on the valuable cod and lobster stocks, which are a significant source of income for many in the local community. While the consortium has stated that it will conduct extensive studies and consultations to minimize any potential negative effects, the fishermen remain skeptical. The Moyle 2 wind farm is not the first to spark controversy among local fishermen in Northern Ireland. The Moyle 1 wind farm, which was commissioned in 2008 and consists of 30 turbines, has faced similar concerns and criticisms. A study commissioned by the developer of Moyle 1, Airtricity, found no significant negative impact on fish stocks. However, local fishermen argue that the study's methodology and scope were insufficient. As the Moyle 2 project moves forward, the focus remains on finding a balance between renewable energy development and the protection of local fishermen's livelihoods. The consortium has pledged to engage with the fishing community throughout the development process, including the implementation of mitigation measures and ongoing monitoring of the potential impact on fish stocks. In conclusion, the proposed Moyle 2 wind farm off the County Down coast of Northern Ireland raises important questions about the balance between renewable energy development and the protection of traditional industries and livelihoods. While the consortium behind the project aims to minimize any potential negative effects, local fishermen remain concerned about the impact on their livelihoods and the future of the fisheries in",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Mental health: Pregnancy,"Smaller studies echo this finding, adding weight to the notion that mental health issues are common during pregnancy. It is also clear that many women experience stress, anxiety, and other forms of emotional distress and mental illness at this and at other times during pregnancy. Researchers estimate that up to one in five women experience depression or anxiety during pregnancy or the postpartum period, and these conditions can significantly impact both mothers and their developing babies. One study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that approximately 12% of pregnant women met the diagnostic criteria for depression, while another study in the Journal of Affective Disorders reported a prevalence rate of up to 19% for anxiety during pregnancy. These statistics are particularly concerning given the potential risks associated with untreated mental health conditions during pregnancy. For example, depression and anxiety during pregnancy have been linked to preterm labor, low birth weight, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal mental health issues can also impact child development, including cognitive and language development, and can increase the risk of behavioral problems in childhood. Despite these risks, many women do not seek help for their mental health concerns during pregnancy. Stigma, lack of awareness, and fear of the potential impact on their babies are some of the reasons why women may be reluctant to seek care. However, it is essential that pregnant women receive the support they need to manage their mental health. There are several interventions that have been shown to be effective in treating mental health issues during pregnancy. For example, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) have both been found to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Antidepressant medications may also be appropriate for some women, but the risks and benefits should be carefully considered. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in identifying and supporting women who are experiencing mental health issues during pregnancy. Screening tools, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), can help identify women who may be at risk for depression and anxiety. Regular check-ups and open communication between healthcare providers and their patients can also help ensure that mental health concerns are addressed in a timely and effective manner. Additionally, community-based support programs, such as peer support groups and mental health hotlines, can provide valuable resources and support for women who are struggling with mental health issues during pregnancy. These resources can help women connect with others who have had similar experiences, share coping strategies, and receive the emotional and practical support they need. In conclusion, mental health issues are common during pregnancy, and these conditions can have significant impacts on both mothers and their developing babies. It is essential that pregnant women receive the support they need to manage their mental health.

Plan for Scottish opt-out organ donation system published,"At present, people must opt-in to the organ donation system in Scotland if they wish to make a contribution towards saving lives after their death. This means that thousands of potential donors may be missed each year due to the complexities of the current process. In a bid to address this issue and increase the number of available organs for transplant, the Scottish Government has published plans for an opt-out organ donation system. Under the proposed new system, individuals would be considered as potential donors unless they had explicitly stated otherwise. This approach, also known as ""presumed consent,"" has been successful in other European countries such as Spain, Austria, and Belgium. These countries have reported significant increases in organ donation rates, saving countless lives as a result. The Scottish Government has stated that it will conduct an extensive public awareness campaign to educate people about the changes and address any concerns they may have. This campaign will include public consultations, engagement with health professionals, and collaboration with various community organizations. ""We believe that this new approach will save lives and give families who have lost loved ones the comfort of knowing that their organ donation wishes have been respected,"" said Health Secretary Humza Yousaf. There will be provisions in place to protect the rights of individuals who do not wish to donate their organs. These include the ability to record their decision against donation, known as ""opt-out,"" on the Organ Donor Register. This register, which is accessible to healthcare professionals, will serve as a critical tool in ensuring that the wishes of potential donors are respected. The Scottish Government has acknowledged that the implementation of the new system will require time and careful planning. To this end, they plan to work closely with health boards and healthcare professionals to ensure a smooth transition. They will also collaborate with the NHS Blood and Transplant organization to manage the logistics of the new system. The proposed opt-out organ donation system has been met with a mixed response from the public. While some individuals have expressed their support for the measure, others have voiced concerns about the potential implications for privacy and personal autonomy. Despite these concerns, the Scottish Government remains committed to the implementation of the new system. They believe that the potential benefits â in terms of lives saved and the ease of the donation process â far outweigh any potential challenges. The Scottish Parliament is expected to debate the proposed changes to the organ donation system in the coming weeks. If approved, the new system could be in place as early as 2022. As the debate continues and the Scottish Government works towards the implementation of the new system, it remains to be seen how it will impact the number of available organs for transplant and the lives of those in need. Regardless, the proposed opt-out system represents an important step forward in the quest to save lives and improve the lives of many Scots.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Newspaper headlines: Trump 'eyes NHS' and Johnson's PM pitch,"By BBC NewsStaff The potential sale of National Health Service (NHS) data or access to its funding as part of a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the US has once again become a topic of controversy. The i newspaper reports that President Trump demanded access to NHS funding during Prime Minister Theresa May's recent visit to the White House. The i's interpretation reads: ""Trump demands access to NHS funding as price of Brexit trade deal."" The paper also states that Mrs May appeared to explain to Mr Trump what the NHS is, and that the US President had responded by saying that ""everything is on the table."" The Guardian adds that Mrs May sought to assure Mr Trump that the NHS was not for sale during their talks. However, the paper also cites unnamed sources who claim that US officials have been discussing the possibility of a deal with the NHS. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has weighed in on the matter, stating that the NHS should not be used as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks. He also called on the government to release the details of the discussions between the US and UK officials. The Liberal Democrats have gone further, accusing the government of having a ""secret plan"" to sell off the NHS to US corporations. Party leader Vince Cable has demanded that the government come clean about its intentions. The US embassy in London has denied any plans to privatize the NHS, stating that ""the US and UK share a special relationship based on values and interests, and we look forward to deepening our cooperation in a future partnership."" However, concerns about the potential sale of NHS data or access to its funding have been raised before. In 2017, it was reported that the US was pushing for greater access to NHS patient data as part of a trade deal. The NHS is a cherished institution in the UK, with universal healthcare available to all residents. Any suggestion that it could be sold off or opened up to foreign companies has been met with fierce opposition from politicians and the public alike. The government has denied any plans to sell off the NHS, but the controversy surrounding the potential sale of NHS data or access to its funding as part of a trade deal shows no signs of abating. The issue is likely to remain a contentious one as the UK moves towards Brexit and begins negotiations with the US and other countries. The potential implications for patient privacy and the future of the NHS are significant, and it is essential that the government is transparent about its intentions and the details of any discussions with foreign governments. Only then can the public have confidence that their healthcare system is not being used as a bargaining chip in trade talks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Francois Fillon's wife facing payment investigation,"It comes after Le Canard Enchaine, a French investigative newspaper, claimed Penelope Fillon, the wife of former French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, earned about 500,000 euros (Â£430,000) as her husband's assistant in Parliament over a decade. The newspaper has questioned how much work she actually did during this period. The allegations, which have drawn intense media scrutiny and public interest, centre on Penelope Fillon being paid for a full-time parliamentary assistant role despite little evidence of her carrying out the duties expected of such a position. The reports have sparked a payment investigation by the European Parliament. The European Parliament's anti-fraud office, OLAF, confirmed that it had opened an investigation into the issue, stating that they would look into the employment contracts of Penelope Fillon and her husband between 2007 and 2012. An OLAF spokesperson said, ""We have received information and have opened a preliminary inquiry to gather all the necessary details."" Francois Fillon, a centre-right politician, has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that his wife did work as a parliamentary assistant. He added that the payments were in line with parliamentary rules and regulations. He stated, ""My wife worked with me, and I am proud of that. She carried out her duties efficiently and effectively."" However, the evidence presented by Le Canard Enchaine appears to contradict this claim. The newspaper has published details of emails and documents it says demonstrate that Penelope Fillon rarely attended meetings and played a minimal role in her husband's parliamentary office. One meeting record shows that she was absent for 15 out of 17 sessions. The controversy has significantly damaged Francois Fillon's political standing, with many commentators questioning his judgment and ethics. His once promising campaign for the French presidency has faltered, and he now trails far behind the leading candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, in opinion polls. The investigation into Penelope Fillon's employment is not the first time that Francois Fillon has faced allegations of financial wrongdoing. In 2007, he was cleared of charges that he employed his children as parliamentary assistants, despite little evidence of their work. ThePayment investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and its findings will likely have significant consequences for the Fillon family and Francois Fillon's political career.

Abusive Birmingham husband 'beat wife and locked her indoors',"Aziz Rehman, a 47-year-old man from Collingbourne Avenue in Hodge Hill, Birmingham, subjected his wife, Zeenit Bibi, to a life of isolation and abuse. Rehman's controlling behaviour extended beyond mere verbal assaults; he physically harassed his wife, leaving her with bruises and emotional scars. The outside world was a forbidden territory for Zeenit. Aziz would only allow her to leave their home when accompanying their children to school. He monitored her closely during these brief excursions, scrutinizing her every move as if checking for any sign of disloyalty. Zeenit lived in a constant state of fear. Her husband's temper was unpredictable, and she never knew what might trigger his rage. One moment he would be affectionate, the next, violent. The thin veil of calm would suddenly shatter, giving way to a storm of anger and violence. Despite the physical and emotional pain she endured, Zeenit held on to the hope that things would improve. She believed that if she could be a better wife, if she could meet his every demand, then perhaps he would change. But no matter how hard she tried, Aziz's abuse continued. The walls of their home became Zeenit's prison. She was trapped in a cycle of fear and despair, with no escape. Her children, unaware of the turmoil within their own home, grew up seeing their mother live in silence, her pleas for help unheard. Neighbours reported hearing loud arguments and occasional cries for help from within the Rehman household. Yet, none dared to intervene, unsure of what was truly happening behind those closed doors. Zeenit's only respite came in the form of secret correspondence with a sympathetic relative. These letters provided her with a lifeline, a connection to the outside world that she desperately clung on to. Through them, she learned about resources available to women in her position, and she began to formulate a plan. One fateful day, as Aziz was at work and the children were at school, Zeenit took a deep breath and made her move. She gathered her belongings, ensuring the children's essentials were included, and left the house. With her heart pounding in her chest, she sought refuge at a women's shelter, finally finding the safety and support she had longed for. As the days passed, Zeenit began to heal.

R.I.P. Car tax disc,"Magazine Monitor: A Farewell to the Car Tax Disc The car tax disc, a small yet significant cultural artefact in the United Kingdom, came to an end on October 1, 2014. Introduced in the Roads Act 1920, its original role in life was to provide a physical proof of payment of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), or road tax, as it became commonly known. The tax disc, a rectangular piece of paper with a distinctive blue and white design, was an essential accessory for every British motorist. It was displayed prominently on the vehicle's windscreen, serving as an instant confirmation of the car's legitimacy to be on the road. The absence of a valid tax disc could result in a hefty fine, and in some cases, the impounding of the vehicle. The system, which began in 1921, initially operated on an annual basis. Motorists would visit their local Post Office to purchase a tax disc and affix it to their windscreen. The disc was typically valid for a year, after which it needed to be renewed. In 1937, the scheme was revised, and a system of quarterly renewals was introduced. The car tax disc's demise was a long time coming. The digital age had been encroaching on the physical tax disc for several years. In 1994, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) introduced an electronic database, allowing law enforcement officials to check a vehicle's tax status remotely. This led to the phasing out of the paper tax disc in favour of an annual reminder letter sent to motorists. However, it wasn't until 2014 that the physical tax disc was finally consigned to the history books. The decision to abolish it was made in 2013 by then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. The move was part of a larger government initiative to digitise various aspects of public services. As the car tax disc faded away, it left behind a nostalgic trail. For many, the disc was a symbol of British motoring history. Its disappearance marked the end of an era, making way for a more efficient and digital world. But for some, the loss of the car tax disc was more than just a symbolic farewell. The disc was a tangible reminder of the simple pleasures of driving, a physical link to the past, and a tangible representation of the freedom of the open road. As the last of the car tax discs were replaced by digital alternatives, the collective sigh of nostalgia was palpable. The end of an era had arrived, leaving behind a legacy that would continue to inspire and captivate the hearts and minds of British motorists for generations to come.

Mexican Red Cross volunteers have also travelled to Houston to provide much-needed assistance. President Trump, in a surprising turn of events, expressed his gratitude for Mexico's offer of aid. ""I want to thank Mexico and their President for the support they have offered to the fantastic people of Texas,"" Trump said in a statement. ""The United States of America is with you today, and we will be with you every step of the way,"" he added. Trump's statement marked a shift from his controversial stance on immigration and his repeated criticisms of Mexico. The offer of aid came at a time when the United States was in dire need of external assistance to deal with the catastrophic floods. The flooding in Houston was the result of heavy rainfall, caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which made landfall on August 25. The storm had stalled over the city, leading to incessant rain and record-breaking flooding. Thousands of people had been rescued from their homes, and many more were in need of aid. The Mexican government's offer of assistance was not the only one received by the United States. Other countries, including Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom, had also pledged their support. The United Nations had launched an appeal for $150 million to help provide emergency assistance to those affected by the floods. Despite the widespread aid, the situation in Houston remained dire. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, and many areas were still underwater. The National Guard was working round the clock to evacuate people trapped in their homes, and the Red Cross was providing shelter and food to those who had been displaced. The flooding had also caused widespread damage to businesses and homes, with estimates suggesting that the cost of the damage could run into billions of dollars. The long-term recovery efforts were expected to be lengthy and complex, and it was clear that the people of Houston would need all the help they could get. As the situation in Houston continued to evolve, the world watched with bated breath, hoping for the best. The offer of aid from Mexico and other countries was a testament to the power of international cooperation and the human spirit. In times of crisis, it was heartening to see that people came together to help those in need, regardless of borders or politics. As the people of Houston faced an uncertain future, they could take solace in the fact that they were not alone. The world was with them, and they would get through this together. The road to recovery would be long and arduous, but with the help of friends and allies, they would emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The team's players, dressed in their Champions League-winning kit, waved and smiled at the crowds, some even stopping to take selfies or sign autographs. The sight of their heroes, holding aloft the coveted trophy, was enough to send the fans into raptures.

'Anti-transgender' bus is met by protests in Boston,"The bright orange bus, adorned with large letters that read ""Save Women,"" rolled into Boston's Fenway Park area, drawing a crowd of onlookers and protesters. The bus, which is operated by the organization ""MassResistance,"" is on a nationwide tour criticizing what it calls ""gender ideology."" The words ""you can't change sex"" and ""it's biology"" are emblazoned on its sides, and it closely resembles a school bus, adding an ominous tone to its message. The arrival of the bus was met with swift and vocal opposition from the transgender community and their allies. A diverse group of protesters, holding rainbow flags and signs that read ""Trans Lives Matter"" and ""Trans Rights Are Human Rights,"" gathered in the park to voice their objections to the bus's message. ""This bus is spreading hate and misinformation about transgender people,"" said Alex, a local transgender activist. ""It's not just wrong, it's dangerous. It's important that we stand up against this kind of hate speech and let trans people know that they are valued and loved in our community."" The bus, which was parked near the entrance to the park, was surrounded by police officers to ensure the safety of all parties involved. The tension between the two groups was palpable as they exchanged heated words and chants. ""You're not women, you're biologically male!"" shouted some members of the bus's entourage, eliciting frustrated responses from the protesters. ""That's not science, that's bigotry!"" they countered. The scene outside Fenway Park echoed similar protests that have taken place in other cities across the country. The bus tour, which has been traveling for several months, has sparked controversy and debate about the role of gender identity in society and the rights of transgender individuals. ""This bus is a reminder of the importance of standing up for the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their gender identity,"" said Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement. ""Boston is a welcoming city, and we reject hate speech and discrimination in all its forms."" As the day wore on, the tension between the two groups began to dissipate, and the protesters dispersed, leaving the bright orange bus to continue on its tour. But the memory of the confrontation lingered, serving as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for transgender rights and the importance of standing up against hate speech and discrimination.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rochdale Council leaders 'let down' groomed girls,"The review was ordered by Rochdale Council after nine men were jailed last year for grooming and abusing teenage girls in what became known as the Rochdale sex scandal. The harrowing revelations of the systematic exploitation of vulnerable young girls shook the community and the nation, leaving many questioning how such heinous acts could have been allowed to happen under the nose of the local authorities. The independent inquiry, led by Professor Alexis Jay, was established to examine the actions of Rochdale Council and its various agencies in relation to the child sexual exploitation (CSE) cases that came to light in 2012. The inquiry aimed to uncover the truth about how the girls were let down by those who were supposed to protect them. Professor Jay's report, published in 2013, painted a damning picture of institutional failure and systemic inadequacies within Rochdale Council and its agencies. The report highlighted a culture of denial and disbelief among council staff, police, and social services, who failed to recognise the signs of CSE or take appropriate action to protect the victims. The review found that council staff had failed to act on numerous reports of CSE, some of which dated back to 2004. In some cases, social workers had even advised girls to go to the homes of their abusers, under the false belief that it was a way to help them integrate into the community. The inquiry also revealed that some council staff had expressed disbelief or even sympathy with the abusers, rather than with the victims. The report also criticised the police for their failure to investigate reports of CSE and their lack of understanding of the issue. It was noted that some officers had dismissed the girls' complaints as trivial, and that they had often failed to interview victims in a sensitive and appropriate manner. The Rochdale sex scandal also exposed a culture of fear and intimidation within the community, which had prevented victims from coming forward and reporting the abuse. Many girls had been too afraid to speak out, fearing reprisals from their abusers and their families. Following the publication of the Jay report, Rochdale Council made a number of commitments to improving its response to CSE. The council established a new Safeguarding Partnership Board and pledged to increase awareness of CSE among staff, communities, and schools. It also committed to implementing all of the report's recommendations and improving communication and information sharing between agencies. However, the tragic events in Rochdale serve as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of institutional failure and the need for robust and effective action to tackle CSE. The report's findings underscore the importance of a multi-agency approach to preventing and addressing CSE, and the need for ongoing training, awareness-raising, and support for victims. In conclusion, the Rochdale sex scandal was a tragic reminder of the devastating",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Abuse inquiry: Legal action threat from 'left out' survivors,"By Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Survivors of historical abuse in Scotland, who feel they have been ""left out"" of the ongoing inquiry, are considering taking legal action to challenge the process. The group White Flowers Alba, which represents those who allege they were abused in care homes and other institutions, said it was seeking a judicial review because the inquiry will not look at their cases. The group claimed this was ""unfair"" as similar allegations were being examined by the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI), which was established in 2015 to investigate historical abuse in care homes, religious and secular institutions, and other settings. However, White Flowers Alba stated that their members' cases were not covered by the inquiry's remit. The group's chairperson, Sarah Smith, explained, ""We have members who have been failed by the system and have been left out of the inquiry. It's not fair that they're not being given the same opportunity to have their voices heard and to get answers to the questions they have."" Ms Smith added that some members had been abused in institutions outside the inquiry's remit, such as private foster homes, while others had been abused by individuals who were not employed by the state or religious institutions. She emphasized that her group's members were seeking closure and accountability, not just an apology. The Scottish Government has previously defended the inquiry's terms of reference, stating that it was necessary to limit its scope to ensure a thorough and efficient investigation. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government said, ""The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry is a complex and wide-ranging investigation into historical abuse in care homes, religious and secular institutions, and other settings. The inquiry has the power to look at allegations of abuse outside its formal terms of reference, but only in relation to institutions and settings within its remit."" White Flowers Alba has been in contact with the Scottish Human Rights Commission and is seeking legal advice on the possibility of a judicial review. The group's members are also considering taking individual legal action against the Scottish Government and other relevant organizations. The issue of historical abuse in Scotland has been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent years, with several high-profile investigations and reports revealing widespread allegations of abuse in care homes and other institutions. The Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry is expected to publish its final report in 2023. White Flowers Alba's call for a broader investigation into historical abuse reflects a growing frustration among survivors and their supporters that the inquiry has not gone far enough. The group's chairperson, Sarah Smith, expressed her hope that the inquiry would expand its remit in the future to include all cases of historical abuse, regardless of the setting or the perpetrator.

Police Ombudsman to resume RUC misconduct investigations,"In the aftermath of a damning report in 2011, investigations into misconduct within the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) were suspended, leaving a significant backlog of cases unaddressed. The report, commissioned by the then Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, revealed that the independence of the office had been compromised, casting doubt on the integrity of past investigations. Many of the cases involve allegations of excessive use of force by RUC officers, some of which date back several decades. These allegations have long been a source of controversy, fueling mistrust between the police and the communities they serve, particularly in areas of historical conflict. The suspension of investigations was met with disappointment and frustration from those who had been waiting for answers and closure. The police ombudsman's office, responsible for investigating complaints against the RUC and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), was under immense pressure to rectify this situation. After a period of reflection and restructuring, it has been announced that investigations will now resume. The new Police Ombudsman, Dr. Michael Maguire, who took up the position in 2016, has expressed his commitment to restoring the confidence of the public in the office's ability to carry out impartial investigations. To ensure the independence of the office is upheld, Dr. Maguire has introduced several measures. One such measure is the appointment of an independent assessor, who will review all cases before they are investigated to ensure they meet the necessary criteria. The resumption of investigations has been welcomed by campaigners and victims' groups. However, it is important to note that this is not a panacea for the deep-rooted issues that have plagued the relationship between the police and the communities they serve, particularly in the context of historical conflict. The challenge now for the Police Ombudsman's office is to deliver on its promise of impartial, fair, and transparent investigations. This will require not only a robust and effective process but also a commitment to ongoing engagement with the communities that have been affected by past misconduct. The resumption of RUC misconduct investigations marks an important step towards restoring trust and accountability in the police and the criminal justice system. However, it must be remembered that these investigations are just one aspect of a broader process of dealing with the past and addressing the legacies of conflict and division in Northern Ireland. As Dr. Maguire himself has acknowledged, ""there is no quick fix"" to the challenges that lie ahead. However, with a renewed commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence, there is hope that the Police Ombudsman's office can make a meaningful contribution to the ongoing process of healing and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Infant classes over 30 almost treble in five years,"By Judith Burns, BBC News education reporter Some 72,000 infant pupils in England are now in large classes, up from 24,700 in 2008, suggests data from the Department for Education. This represents a near-tripling of the number of children in reception, year 1 and year 2 classes with more than 30 pupils in just over a decade. This trend has raised concerns among education experts and teachers' unions, who argue that large class sizes hinder the ability of teachers to provide individual attention to each pupil. They claim that smaller class sizes are crucial for early years development and setting children up for success in their future education. The National Education Union (NEU) has criticised the government for the surge in large infant classes. ""The evidence is clear that smaller class sizes are an important factor in improving educational outcomes,"" said Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU. ""This is especially true for our youngest learners, who need more individual attention from their teachers."" The Government has defended its record on class sizes, stating that the overall number of children in larger classes has remained relatively stable since 2010. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""The vast majority of infant classes continue to have 30 or fewer pupils, with 72% of these classes having fewer than 27 pupils. We understand the importance of classroom size for early years education and have provided significant funding to support schools in reducing class sizes where necessary."" However, some schools have reported significant challenges in managing large classes. Sarah, a reception teacher in a large primary school in the north of England, shared her concerns: ""I have 32 children in my class and it's incredibly difficult to give each child the individual attention they need. I spend a lot of my time managing behaviour and trying to keep the class quiet so I can teach. It's not ideal for the children's learning."" Education experts also warn that large classes can lead to increased teacher workload and stress, potentially contributing to the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis. According to a recent survey by the NEU, 61% of respondents reported that workload was a significant factor in their decision to leave the teaching profession. Despite these concerns, some schools have found ways to make large classes work effectively. In a primary school in London, a team of teaching assistants work with the teacher to provide additional support to individual children. The headteacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""We recognise the challenges that come with large classes, but we've found that by working together as a team, we can ensure that every child receives the attention they need."" As the debate over class sizes continues, it remains to be seen whether the government will take further action to address the issue and ensure that every infant pupil in England receives the best possible start to their education.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

"Alun Cairns: Trial row ex-minister paid Â£16,000 after resignation","A spokesperson for Alun Cairns, the Vale of Glamorgan MP, confirmed that the former Welsh Government minister received a payment of Â£16,000 after his resignation in October 2018. The payment, which was revealed in a freedom of information request, has sparked controversy and raised questions about the nature of the payment and the circumstances surrounding Mr Cairns' departure from the role. Mr Cairns resigned from his position as Secretary of State for Wales following allegations that he knew about an inappropriate comment made by a former aide, but failed to act on the information. The aide, Mark Wiseman, was later suspended from the Conservative Party after being accused of making an offensive comment about a rape claim against a Welsh Assembly Member. The spokesperson for Mr Cairns said the payment was ""in common with the departure of every minister"". However, the detail of such payments is usually kept confidential, and it is rare for the exact amount to be made public. The fact that this payment was revealed raises questions about transparency and accountability in the way that such payments are made. Labour MP for Cardiff Central, Jenny Rathbone, called for an explanation from the government about the payment, saying ""It is simply not good enough for the Conservatives to claim this payment was standard when we don't know what the standard payment is."" She also called for details of all payments made to ministers upon their departure from government, stating ""The public have a right to know how their money is being spent."" The Conservative Party has defended the payment, with a spokesperson stating ""All payments made to former ministers are a matter for the Cabinet Office. This payment was made in accordance with the Cabinet Office's guidelines and was not unusual."" However, the opposition parties have called for an independent investigation into the matter, with Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for Wales, Helen Mary Jones, saying ""The public deserve to know that their money is being used appropriately and not being wasted on golden goodbyes for failed ministers."" The controversy surrounding the payment comes at a difficult time for the Conservative Party in Wales, with opinion polls suggesting that they are lagging behind Labour in the run-up to the May 2019 elections for the National Assembly for Wales. The party will be hoping to put this issue to one side and focus on their campaign, but the controversy is likely to continue to cast a shadow over their efforts.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Peckham baby death attack: Accused 'not ready to be father',"Malorie Bantala, a 22-year-old resident of Peckham, London, was left fighting for her life after an horrifying attack that resulted in her giving birth to a stillborn baby at just 32 weeks. According to police reports, the assault took place on the evening of February 15th, when Ms. Bantala was approached by two individuals near her home. Kevin Wilson, a 32-year-old man, and a 17-year-old boy, allegedly wore helmets during the assault, which left Ms. Bantala with severe injuries to her head and body. According to the Metropolitan Police, the attack occurred after Ms. Bantala refused to comply with the demands of the assailants. The circumstances surrounding the incident are still unclear, but it is believed that the attack may have been motivated by the fact that Ms. Bantala was pregnant. Wilson and the 17-year-old have been charged with attempted murder and grievous bodily harm in connection with the assault. Friends and family of Ms. Bantala describe her as a young woman with a bright future ahead of her. She had recently completed a nursing degree and was looking forward to starting her career and building a family of her own. However, her dreams were shattered in an instant by the brutal attack. In the aftermath of the assault, Ms. Bantala was taken to a local hospital where she underwent emergency surgery to save her life. Tragically, her baby did not survive the attack and was born stillborn. Ms. Bantala remains in a critical condition in the hospital, and her loved ones are by her side as she battles to recover. The news of the attack has shocked the local community, with many expressing their disbelief and anger at the senseless violence. Neighbors and friends have described Ms. Bantala as a kind and gentle soul, and they cannot comprehend why anyone would want to harm her. The Metropolitan Police are appealing for anyone with information about the assault to come forward and contact them. Detectives believe that there may be witnesses who have not yet come forward, and they are urging them to come forward and help bring those responsible to justice. In the meantime, the community of Peckham is coming together to support Ms. Bantala and her family during this difficult time. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover the costs of her medical bills and other expenses, and a local crowdfunding campaign has been launched to raise funds for a memorial bench in her memory.

Ipswich Hospital 'now meets standards' - CQC,"The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has announced that Ipswich Hospital now meets the required standards following their recent inspection in July. This comes after previous reports in May and November 2011 identified failings in certain areas. The CQC team inspected various aspects of the hospital's services, including safety, effectiveness, care, responsiveness, and leadership. They found that the hospital had made significant improvements since the last inspection. In the safety category, the CQC noted that the hospital had taken steps to improve the management of medicines, including the implementation of a new electronic prescribing system. They also found that the hospital had made progress in reducing the number of falls among patients. In the effectiveness category, the CQC found that the hospital had made improvements in the assessment and treatment of patients with mental health needs. they also noted that the hospital had implemented a new system for managing referrals, which had reduced waiting times for specialist appointments. The care category was another area where the hospital had made significant progress. The CQC found that staff were caring and compassionate towards patients, and that they were responsive to patients' needs. They also noted that the hospital had implemented new policies to improve the hygiene standards in the wards. The responsiveness category was another area where the hospital had made improvements. The CQC found that the hospital had improved its communication with patients and their families, and that they were more responsive to their concerns and queries. In the leadership category, the CQC found that the hospital had made progress in improving the leadership and management of its services. They noted that the hospital had implemented a new system for monitoring and reporting incidents, and that staff were more engaged and involved in the decision-making process. The hospital's Chief Executive, Andrew Reed, welcomed the CQC's findings, saying that the improvements were a result of the hard work and dedication of staff. He also acknowledged that there was still work to be done, and that the hospital would continue to focus on making further improvements in all areas of its services. The hospital had faced criticism in the past for its poor performance in certain areas, and the CQC's latest findings will come as a welcome relief for patients, their families, and staff.

Vale of Glamorgan: Parking charge plans spark anger,"In the picturesque Vale of Glamorgan, plans by the local council to introduce parking charges in town centres, coastal paths, and two country parks have sparked outrage among residents and commuters. The proposed fees have been met with strong opposition, with many arguing that they will negatively impact local businesses and add an unnecessary financial burden to those who live and work in the area. Wendy Rogers, a local resident and worker in Llantwit Major, expressed her frustration at the proposed charges. ""I come into work early every day, and I usually have to park in the town centre,"" she said. ""These new charges will add up quickly, making it a tax to work. It's just another way for the council to take money from hardworking people."" The Vale of Glamorgan council, however, defended their decision, stating that the charges were necessary to cover the costs of maintaining and improving the car parks and facilities. ""We understand that some people may be disappointed with the proposed charges,"" a council spokesperson said. ""However, it's important to note that the revenue generated will be reinvested back into the parks and town centres, ensuring that they continue to provide a high-quality experience for visitors."" Despite this, many are skeptical of the council's intentions. Some argue that the fees will disproportionately affect low-income families and pensioners, who may not be able to afford the added expense. Others point to the fact that the council has made significant cuts to services in recent years, leading some to question where the money for maintenance and improvement has gone. The controversy has also sparked a debate about the role of local authorities in generating revenue and the impact of parking charges on businesses. Some studies suggest that parking charges can actually boost footfall and revenue for local businesses, while others argue that they can deter visitors, particularly those who are put off by the added cost. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how the proposed parking charges will be received by the local community. Some have called for the council to reconsider their decision, while others have urged people to continue using the car parks and make their voices heard. One thing is certain, however: the issue is far from resolved, and the future of parking in the Vale of Glamorgan remains uncertain. In the meantime, residents and commuters are urged to keep an eye on developments and engage in the consultation process to ensure that their views are heard. The council has promised to listen to feedback and consider alternative solutions, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to quell the growing anger and frustration over the proposed charges. For now, the Vale of Glamorgan remains divided, with some looking forward to the improvements that the charges may bring, while others see them as an unwelcome and unnecessary addition to the financial burden of everyday life.

Zimbabwe media slow to cover military takeover,"By BBC Monitoring The world watched in stunned silence as Zimbabwe's military took control of the country's streets on the morning of 15 November 2017. State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that President Robert Mugabe and his family were safe but that the army was taking action against criminals around him. Yet, as the world's media raced to cover the unfolding events, Zimbabwean media remained surprisingly quiet. The state-owned press, which had long been criticized for its pro-government stance, did not report on the military takeover until several hours later. The private media, which had been critical of the Mugabe regime and had been allowed to operate more freely in recent years, also remained largely silent. Only a few online publications and social media accounts broke the news, with most waiting for official confirmation before reporting. The slow response from Zimbabwean media was in stark contrast to the rapid coverage of similar events in other parts of the world. In Egypt in 2011, for example, social media was at the forefront of the Arab Spring uprisings, with citizen journalists providing real-time coverage of protests and clashes with security forces. But in Zimbabwe, the military takeover came as a surprise to many, including the media. There had been no reports of unrest or tension leading up to the military action, and the country had appeared to be business as usual. The lack of coverage also raised concerns about freedom of the press in Zimbabwe. Critics accused the government of using its control over state media to suppress information and manipulate public opinion. Yet, as the day wore on, more and more information began to emerge. The military's statement that Mugabe was under house arrest was confirmed by several sources, and the ruling ZANU-PF party issued a statement backing the military action. The slow response from Zimbabwean media was also a reflection of the country's political landscape. Mugabe had been in power since 1980, and his regime had long used state media to promote its message and suppress dissent. The military takeover represented a new chapter in Zimbabwe's history, and it remained to be seen how the media would respond in this new political landscape. Some saw it as an opportunity for greater press freedom, while others warned of continued government control and manipulation. As the world waited for more developments, Zimbabwean media continued to play catch-up, reporting the latest news as it emerged. The military takeover had caught everyone by surprise, and it was clear that the media would be playing a crucial role in shaping the narrative of this new chapter in Zimbabwe's history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine,"By James Gallagher, Health and science correspondent The UK's medicines safety regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has announced that under-40s will be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab, due to the risk of rare but serious blood clots. The MHRA said there had been 242 cases of these clots and 49 related deaths in the UK, out of 28.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered. The majority of cases occurred in women under the age of 60. Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine still outweighed the risks for the majority of the population. But he added: ""Based on the current evidence, the MHRA has concluded that the benefits of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 Vaccine in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people in the UK. ""However, my advice to the JCVI is that people under 40 years old should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine, where one is available, when they attend for their first dose."" The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are currently being used for second doses in the UK, are preferred options for those under 40. The MHRA stressed that the risk of these clots was still very low, and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweighed the risks for the majority of people. The JCVI is now updating its guidance for healthcare professionals in England, Scotland and Wales, and is expected to issue new advice for Northern Ireland in the coming days. The announcement comes after similar decisions by a number of European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, to limit the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people or those with underlying health conditions. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also said there is a possible link between the vaccine and very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low platelets, but that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks. The UK government's vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said the decision was based on the latest evidence from the MHRA and the JCVI. He added: ""I want to reassure everyone that the MHRA and the JCVI have taken a cautious and precautionary approach based on the evidence available to them. The vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against Covid-19 and its variants."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sea search for Brighton woman is called off,"Coastguards said it was thought a couple entered the sea after a night out and the woman was swept away. Rescue teams were scrambled overnight but waves of up to 3m in height made it impossible to launch a search and rescue boat. The Brighton coastguard team received the call at around 2am on Sunday morning, alerting them to the possible incident at Brighton Marina. The couple, believed to be in their late twenties, had reportedly been seen entering the sea near the marina. Coastguard teams from Shoreham and Newhaven, as well as the Brighton inshore lifeboat, were called to the scene. However, the strong winds and large waves prevented them from launching a search immediately. The RNLI lifeguards, who had been patrolling the beach during the day, were also called to assist. They too were unable to launch their inflatable rescue boat due to the dangerous conditions. The police and the ambulance service were also notified and a helicopter from the Coastguard Rescue Helicopter Service was sent to the area, but it was unable to fly due to the poor weather conditions. As the hours passed, the tide continued to rise, making the search more difficult. The teams on the ground were forced to wait for the conditions to improve before they could continue their search. By 6am, the tide had started to recede, and the teams were able to launch their boats. They scoured the area where the couple had been last seen, but there was no sign of them. The search was called off shortly after midday, with the teams having covered a large area of the sea. However, they urged anyone with information to come forward. Local residents and beachgoers were asked to keep an eye out for any signs of the missing woman, and anyone with information was asked to contact the police or the coastguard. The woman's family and friends were informed of the situation and were being supported by the emergency services. The incident served as a stark reminder of the dangers of the sea, especially at night and in adverse weather conditions. The teams urged people to take care and to avoid entering the water when the conditions are not suitable for swimming. The search for the missing woman will continue on Monday, with the teams expected to resume their search at first light. In the meantime, the families and friends of the missing woman are urged to keep her in their thoughts and prayers.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fiscal Phil's Budget - is it just about the cash?,"David Cornock, Parliamentary correspondent, Wales: The Budget throws up more than enough to last a lifetime. And when there's not much money around, politicians tend to combine annual increases to give a number with more zeros. It doesn't always add up to substantial change, but this year's Budget, delivered by the chancellor affectionately known as 'Fiscal Phil', has been hailed as different. Is it just about the cash? The focus on fiscal discipline in recent years left many feeling the government had lost touch with the realities of everyday life. This Budget, however, has been designed to address some of the most pressing issues â from health and social care to education and infrastructure. The headline figures may be impressive: an extra Â£33bn for health and social care over the next three years, Â£4.8bn for schools and colleges, and Â£27bn for roads, rail, and other infrastructure projects. But it's the detail that reveals the true intent behind the numbers. For instance, the health and social care package includes a reform of the way social care is funded. The government will introduce a cap on care costs, meaning that once someone has paid a certain amount, the state will cover the rest. It's a long-overdue change that could provide much-needed peace of mind for thousands of families. Education funding, meanwhile, will see a real-terms increase in spending, with schools receiving an extra Â£1.3bn next year. This comes as the government aims to level up education standards across the country, and it's a clear sign that the chancellor recognises the importance of a well-funded education system. Infrastructure spending, too, represents a significant investment in the future. Rail improvements, road upgrades, and broadband expansion will all help to make the UK more connected and productive. But it's not just about physical infrastructure â the Budget also includes measures to support digital and green technologies, which will be key to driving economic growth in the coming decades. In short, Fiscal Phil's Budget is about more than just the numbers. It's about investing in the future, addressing the needs of the most vulnerable, and ensuring that the UK's economy remains competitive and dynamic. It may not be a panacea for all of the country's challenges, but it's a step in the right direction. Of course, there are still many questions to be answered â about the impact on the public finances, about the details of the policies, and about the government's long-term vision for the economy. But for now, at least, the Budget has provided a welcome reminder that politics isn't just about the cash. It's about people, and about making a real difference to their lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Lowering tuition fees 'implausible', say vice-chancellors","The party is yet to unveil its policy on university tuition fees, but Ed Miliband, the Labour Party leader, has made it clear that he intends to reduce the cap from the current Â£9,000 to Â£6,000 if he is elected as the prime minister. However, vice-chancellors have expressed their skepticism towards the feasibility of such a move, citing potential financial implications for higher education institutions. Universities have been struggling with the current cap of Â£9,000 per year, which was introduced in 2012. The higher fees have led to an increase in student debt and have raised concerns about the affordability of higher education. Miliband's proposed reduction in fees is seen as a welcome move by some, but university leaders are concerned about how they will make up for the shortfall in revenue. One vice-chancellor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a reduction in fees would result in a significant financial hit. ""If we go back to Â£6,000 fees, we would lose around 20% of our income,"" the vice-chancellor said. ""That's a huge amount of money. We would have to look at ways of making up the shortfall, and that could include things like increasing the number of students we accept each year or cutting costs in other areas."" Another vice-chancellor, speaking at a conference on higher education funding, said that while the idea of lower fees was appealing, the practicalities of implementing such a policy were implausible. ""We have to remember that universities are businesses as well as educational institutions,"" the vice-chancellor said. ""We have to be financially sustainable if we are to provide a high-quality education for our students."" The National Union of Students (NUS) has welcomed Miliband's proposal, saying that it would make higher education more accessible to a greater number of students. ""Reducing tuition fees would be a significant step towards making higher education more affordable for students,"" said NUS president Toni Pearce. ""We believe that every student should have the opportunity to go to university, regardless of their background or financial circumstances."" However, some experts have warned that a reduction in fees could lead to a decrease in the quality of education provided by universities. ""Universities need a stable source of income to invest in research, facilities, and staff,"" said Professor Steve Smith, the vice-chancellor of Exeter University. ""If we start cutting fees willy-nilly, we could end up with a system that is not sustainable in the long term."" The debate over university tuition fees is set to continue, with both sides making their cases for and against a reduction in fees. Miliband and the Labour Party are hoping to appeal to students and their families with their proposed policy, while university leaders are warning of the potential financial implications of such a move.

East London Thames crossings plan to exceed Â£43m,"Figures disclosed by the Mayor of London show the total spent on the East London Thames crossings project will reach Â£43.4m by next year. Assembly Member Darren Johnson, who has been critical of the scheme, has described the cost as ""scandalous."" The revamped Blackwall Tunnel, Woolwich Ferry and Silvertown Tunnel are part of the Thames Crossings Programme aimed at improving transport links between east and south east London and the rest of the capital. The project was initially expected to cost Â£1.5bn, but this has risen significantly due to various factors, including design changes and construction delays. Johnson, who is the Green Party's London Assembly member for City and Docklands, raised concerns about the escalating costs during a recent meeting of the London Assembly's Budget and Performance Committee. He also questioned the value for money of the project, particularly given the financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The total cost of the Thames Crossings Programme is now set to exceed Â£3bn, with over Â£43m spent just on consultancy fees and other costs,"" Johnson said. ""At a time when the Mayor is having to make billions of pounds of cuts to other services, it's scandalous that this project continues to balloon in cost."" The Mayor's office has defended the project, arguing that it is essential for London's future transport needs. A spokesperson for City Hall said: ""The Thames Crossings Programme is a vital investment in London's transport infrastructure. It will deliver significant benefits for communities in east and south east London, including improved road and river crossings, better public transport links and reduced congestion. The costs have risen due to factors beyond our control, including design changes and construction delays."" The Blackwall Tunnel, which was originally built in the 1960s, is currently undergoing a major refurbishment to increase its capacity and improve safety. The Woolwich Ferry, which carries vehicles and pedestrians across the Thames, is also being replaced with a new, larger vessel. The Silvertown Tunnel, a new road tunnel, is expected to open in 2025. Despite the controversy over the costs, the project enjoys broad support from local communities and business leaders. They argue that better transport links will boost economic growth and create jobs in the area. However, with the total cost continuing to rise, there are growing calls for greater transparency and accountability from the Mayor's office. Johnson has called for regular updates on the project's progress and costs, as well as a thorough review of the business case to ensure value for money. He also wants the Mayor to explore alternative funding options, such as public-private partnerships or congestion charging, to reduce the burden on London taxpayers.

Peter Robinson will not attend 'circus act' opening of NI talks,"The inter-party talks, convened by the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, are due to begin next Thursday. Mr Peter Robinson, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland, has announced that he will not be attending the opening session of the negotiations. Robinson's decision comes after weeks of speculation about his involvement in the talks, which are aimed at restoring the power-sharing executive following the collapse of the Stormont Assembly in January. The DUP had been in negotiations with Sinn Fein, the nationalist party, to form a new executive, but these efforts stalled over disagreements on issues such as the Irish language and same-sex marriage. Robinson's absence from the opening session is likely to be seen as a significant blow to the prospects for a successful outcome to the talks. He has been a key figure in Northern Irish politics for decades and has played a central role in previous negotiations. His decision not to attend may send a message to other parties that the DUP is not committed to finding a compromise. The Secretary of State has expressed her disappointment at Robinson's decision, stating that ""it is essential that all parties engage in these talks with a constructive and open-minded attitude in order to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of everyone in Northern Ireland."" The DUP has given no indication of who will lead their delegation in Robinson's absence. It is possible that Arlene Foster, the former First Minister, could take on this role. Foster, who was ousted as First Minister earlier this year following a controversy over a botched renewable energy scheme, has been attempting to rebuild her position within the party. Sinn Fein, meanwhile, has indicated that it is prepared to continue engaging in the talks despite Robinson's absence. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has urged the other parties to ""keep the focus on the issues that matter most to people in Northern Ireland, and not get distracted by side shows or personalities."" The talks are expected to be challenging, with significant differences between the DUP and Sinn Fein on a range of issues. The Irish language, same-sex marriage, and the past are likely to be among the most contentious topics. It is hoped that a deal can be reached before the end of the year, but this may be a ambitious goal given the current political climate. As the talks get underway, it remains to be seen how Robinson's decision not to attend the opening session will impact the negotiations. Some commentators have suggested that it could be a tactical move designed to put pressure on the other parties to make concessions. Others believe that it could signal the beginning of the end for the DUP's involvement in the talks. Only time will tell.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
L'Origine du Monde: Mystery Courbet nude uncovered 150 years on,"Now a French scholar may have solved the mystery that has surrounded Gustave Courbet's ""L'Origine du Monde"" (The Origin of the World) for over a century. This provocative work, painted in 1866 and depicting an explicit female nude, was not exhibited publicly during the artist's lifetime. Courbet reportedly kept it in his studio, showing it only to a select few. For decades, art historians have debated the identity of the model whose body inspired this audacious painting. Some have suggested it was Courbet's mistress, Victorine Meurent. Others speculated it could be his housekeeper, Johanna Demy. Yet, no definitive answer has ever emerged. Enter Jean-Jacques Bouququet, a French scholar and president of the MusÃ©e Gustave Courbet in Ornans. Bouququet has spent the past few years delving into the artist's personal letters, seeking clues that might shed light on the painting's origins. His latest discovery? A letter from 1865, addressed to Courbet's brother, in which the artist writes about painting ""a beautiful, large nude, from life."" Bouququet believes the model in question was likely Louise Jourdan, a young woman who was employed as a servant in the Courbet household at the time. She is known to have posed for other paintings by Courbet, including ""The Widow,"" which was exhibited publicly in 1868. However, proving this theory definitively is not an easy task. Courbet was known to have painted numerous nudes, and there is no concrete evidence linking Jourdan to ""L'Origine du Monde."" Nevertheless, Bouququet's discovery adds another layer to the intrigue surrounding this iconic work. ""L'Origine du Monde"" was first exhibited publicly in 1995, at the MusÃ©e d'Orsay in Paris. It caused a scandal, drawing both criticism and admiration. Today, it is considered a seminal work in the history of modern art. Its explicit depiction of female sexuality challenged societal norms, paving the way for future artists to explore similar themes. Despite the controversy it has generated, ""L'Origine du Monde"" remains a captivating enigma. As Bouququest continues his research, we may finally uncover the full story behind this provocative painting and the woman whose body inspired it. Regardless of who the model was, ""L'Origine du Monde"" stands as a testament to Courbet's mastery of the medium and his willingness to push boundaries. It continues to intrigue and inspire, challenging us to reconsider our perceptions of art and sexuality. As Bouququet delves deeper into the mystery, we can only imagine what other secrets this iconic",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Kinlochleven couple in bid to sue TripAdvisor reviewers,"Martin and Jacqui Clark, the proprietors of a bed and breakfast establishment in the picturesque Scottish village of Kinlochleven, have taken the unprecedented step of initiating legal action against two reviewers on TripAdvisor. The couple, who have run their business for over a decade, maintain that the reviews in question were not only misleading but also outright false. The first review, which appeared on the popular travel website last year, alleged that the Clark's establishment was infested with bed bugs. The authors of the review claimed that they had suffered numerous bites during their stay, leaving them with itchy welts and sleepless nights. However, Martin and Jacqui insist that no such incident ever occurred and that their guests have consistently left positive feedback. The second review, which was published more recently, contained a fabricated account of a disturbing incident that supposedly took place at the bed and breakfast. According to the review, a group of intoxicated guests had engaged in disruptive behaviour late into the night, resulting in damage to property and distress for other guests. Martin and Jacqui, however, deny that any such incident occurred and assert that their guests are always respectful and considerate. Despite these assurances, TripAdvisor has challenged the Clark's decision to pursue legal action against the reviewers. The company's spokesperson, in a statement to the media, insisted that the platform is committed to upholding freedom of speech and that the reviews in question were within the bounds of acceptable content. The Clark's legal team, however, argues that the reviews are not only damaging to their reputation but also potentially harmful to their business. They point out that the false reviews have resulted in a significant decline in bookings, particularly during the peak tourist season. The case has sparked a heated debate among industry experts and legal scholars, with many questioning the implications of the legal action for online reviews and consumer protection. Some argue that the Clark's are within their rights to protect their business reputation, while others caution against the potential chilling effect on free speech and the review culture that has become an integral part of the travel industry. As the case proceeds through the courts, Martin and Jacqui Clark remain hopeful that they will be able to clear their name and restore their reputation. They are determined to fight for the truth and to send a message to other businesses that they too have the right to challenge false and misleading reviews. In the meantime, the Clark's have taken steps to improve their online presence and to engage more actively with their guests. They have launched a new website and have started using social media to showcase their business and to interact with their customers.

Despite the challenges they have faced, Martin and Jacqui remain optimistic about the future. They are proud of their business and of the community they",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Cost of dying 'rose more than 10% last year',"The soaring cost of dying continues to outpace inflation, with the average cost of a funeral now standing at Â£8,427, according to the latest data from insurer SunLife. This represents an increase of over 10% compared to the previous year's figures. This trend is a cause for concern, as the cost of dying has been steadily rising in recent years. In fact, since SunLife first conducted this survey, the average cost of a funeral has increased by an staggering 87%. The rise in costs is due in part to the increasing popularity of more elaborate and expensive funerals, as well as the rising costs of essential services such as probate and headstones. Probate fees, which are paid to the government when someone dies and their estate is being distributed, have risen significantly in recent years. The cost of a cremation or burial fee has also seen a significant increase. Cremation fees, for example, have risen by an average of 4.6% in the past year alone. This is despite the fact that cremations are often seen as a more cost-effective alternative to burials. The cost of a traditional burial, which includes the purchase of a grave plot and a headstone, has risen even more sharply, with an average increase of 10.5% in the past year. The impact of these rising costs is felt most keenly by those who are already grieving the loss of a loved one. Many families are finding it increasingly difficult to afford the cost of a dignified funeral, and are being forced to make difficult choices about how to cut costs. Some are opting for simpler, more affordable funerals, while others are turning to crowdfunding or community support to help cover the costs. Still others are choosing to forego some of the more expensive elements of a funeral, such as flowers or a limousine, in order to keep costs down. The rising cost of dying is a complex issue, and there is no easy solution. While some argue that the cost of funerals is simply a reflection of the increasing cost of living, others believe that more needs to be done to make funerals more affordable for all. Whatever the solution, it is clear that the issue of the rising cost of dying is one that requires urgent attention. As the cost of funerals continues to rise, more and more families are finding themselves facing financial hardship at a time when they are already dealing with the emotional and practical challenges of losing a loved one. It is our hope that by raising awareness of this issue, we can help to spark a conversation about how we can make funerals more affordable and accessible to all, while still ensuring that those who have passed away receive the dignity and respect they deserve.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Who, What, Why: How dangerous is bullfighting?","Who, What, Why: An In-depth Look into the Dangerous World of Bullfighting The Magazine answers the questions behind the news Bullfighting is a ""supremely dangerous art,"" says Garry Marvin, professor of human-animal studies at Roehampton University. ""If a normal person got into the ring with a fighting bull, I'd expect them to be gored, trampled, or even killed,"" he warns. This traditional Spanish spectacle, which dates back to the ancient Romans, has long been a subject of controversy due to the perceived cruelty and danger it presents. So, what exactly is bullfighting, and why is it so risky for both humans and animals involved? Bullfighting is a ritualistic event where a matador, or bullfighter, attempts to provoke a bull into charging and then attempts to kill it with a sword. The bull is usually baited with red capes, or muletas, to make it more aggressive. This bloody spectacle has been a part of Spanish culture for centuries, but the practice has come under increasing scrutiny in recent times. The danger to the matador is obvious. The bull, which can weigh up to 1,500 pounds, charges at the matador with great force, putting the human in a precarious position. A single gore from the bull's horns can result in serious injury or even death. Furthermore, the matador's cape can inadvertently cover the bull's eyes, making it even more agitated and dangerous. But the danger isn't limited to the matador. The bull, which is usually subjected to a series of physical and psychological stressors before the fight, can also suffer injuries and even death. The bull's horns are often sharpened before the fight, and the animal can be weakened by repeated pokes from the matador's sword. The bull's exhaustion and injuries can make it difficult for it to escape the arena, leading to a prolonged and painful death. The use of animals in bullfighting has also been a subject of much debate. Animal rights activists argue that the practice is cruel and inhumane, as it involves the intentional harming and killing of animals for entertainment. Bullfighting supporters, however, argue that the practice is a cultural tradition and that the bulls are treated humanely and are given a quick and painless death. Despite the controversy, bullfighting remains a popular spectacle in Spain and other countries. But as awareness of animal welfare and the dangers of bullfighting continue to grow, it remains to be seen how long this tradition will continue. Some cities and provinces have already banned bullfighting, and it is likely that more will follow suit in the future. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Swansea copper heritage boat Black Prince's maiden voyage,"The Black Prince, Swansea's newest addition to the city's maritime heritage, embarked on its maiden voyage on a sun-kissed Sunday morning. Charles White, chair of Swansea Community Boat Trust, stood proudly on the deck, watching as the historic vessel took on passengers at Swansea marina. He was delighted it had been given the green light to begin regular trips, bringing a new sense of excitement and adventure to the city's waterfront. As the Black Prince cast off from the marina, the eager crowd on board waved goodbye to the shoreline. The boat, a beautiful copper-clad replica of a 19th-century Welsh coal vessel, glistened in the sunlight, its sails billowing gently in the breeze. The passengers, mostly local families, chatted excitedly as they settled into their seats, eager to experience a taste of Swansea's maritime past. The boat's first destination was the Liberty Stadium, home to Swansea City Football Club. As the Black Prince sailed out of the marina and into the calm waters of Swansea Bay, the passengers were treated to stunning views of the city's coastline. The boat's gentle rocking motion provided a soothing backdrop to the tranquil scene, and many passengers closed their eyes, taking in the peacefulness of the moment. Upon arriving at the stadium, the passengers disembarked and were greeted by the sights and sounds of the bustling area. Families with young children explored the stadium grounds, while others took the opportunity to snap photographs of the Black Prince docked at the quay. For many, it was a rare chance to see the boat up close and to learn about its fascinating history. After a few hours at the stadium, the passengers made their way back to the Black Prince, eager to return to the tranquility of the water. As they sailed back towards Swansea marina, the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the bay. The passengers watched in awe as the sun disappeared below the horizon, their faces alight with wonder and delight. As the Black Prince docked back at the marina, the passengers disembarked, their faces glowing with the memories of their unique adventure. Charles White beamed with pride as he watched his creation come to life, providing a new connection to Swansea's rich maritime history. The Black Prince's maiden voyage was more than just a boat ride; it was a journey back in time, a chance to experience the past in a way that was both fun and educational.

HMV saved: Music fans and employees give their verdict,"By Steve Holden, Newsbeat reporter in Manchester The company has been in administration since the beginning of 2013 after problems in the face of online competition. Hilco, a retail restructuring firm, has acquired 132 HMV shops, in a deal that could see the high street chain continue to trade. Reaction to the news has been mixed. Some music fans and employees have welcomed the news, while others are more sceptical. ""I'm really pleased,"" says John, a regular customer at the HMV store in Manchester's Arndale Centre. ""I've been coming here for years and I love the atmosphere. It's nice to be able to come in and browse the CDs and talk to the staff about music."" Employees at the store have also expressed their relief at the news. ""We've all been really worried about our jobs,"" says Sarah, a sales assistant. ""But this deal gives us a chance to carry on. I'm just glad that we can continue to serve our customers and sell the music that we love."" However, not everyone is convinced. ""I think it's too little, too late,"" says Mark, another regular customer. ""The way people buy music has changed and HMV just can't keep up. I think this is just a delay of the inevitable."" Some industry experts agree. ""HMV has been struggling for years,"" says music industry consultant, Simon Daglish. ""They've failed to adapt to the way that people consume music now. Online sales have grown massively and HMV just can't compete."" Despite this, some believe that there is still a place for physical stores in the music industry. ""There's something special about going into a record shop and buying a CD,"" says music fan, Emily. ""You can't get that experience online. I think HMV still has a chance if they can adapt and offer something that the online retailers can't."" Hilco has said that it will be looking to restructure the business and that there will be job losses. It's unclear at this stage how many jobs will be affected or which stores will be closing. For now, customers and employees at the Arndale Centre store in Manchester are just relieved that their local HMV will be staying open.

TVR sports car firm stake bought by Welsh Government,"By Nick Servini, Political editor, Wales The Welsh Government has announced it has bought a stake in iconic British sports car manufacturer TVR, with the aim of reviving the brand and bringing production back to Wales. The deal, which sees the Welsh Government become a minority shareholder, has been described as a significant boost for the Ebbw Vale economy and the wider automotive industry in Wales. TVR, which was founded in 1947 and famously produced the Griffith and Tuscan models, went into administration in 2006. Since then, it has changed hands several times, with various attempts to revive the brand failing to gain traction. But now, with the backing of the Welsh Government, TVR is confident it can get back on track. The company said it will begin production of its new Griffith model in Ebbw Vale later this year, with the first cars expected to roll off the assembly line in 2023. ""This is an exciting moment for TVR and for Wales,"" said Les Edgar, TVR's interim chairman. ""We have a great team in place, and with the support of the Welsh Government, we are confident we can build on the heritage and legacy of this great brand."" The Welsh Government has also provided a Â£2m loan to the company ahead of production getting underway. TVR said there is another year of development work to be done before production can begin in earnest. The deal comes as part of the Welsh Government's wider strategy to support the automotive industry in Wales. The sector employs around 12,000 people in the country and contributes around Â£1.5bn to the economy each year. ""TVR is an iconic brand with a rich history,"" said Ken Skates, the Welsh Government's Economy Minister. ""We are delighted to be able to support its revival and bring production back to Wales. This is a significant investment in the future of the automotive industry in Wales and will create jobs and economic opportunities in the Ebbw Vale area."" The news has been welcomed by industry bodies and trade unions. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it was ""delighted"" to see TVR back in production, while Unite the Union said it was a ""vote of confidence"" in the skills and expertise of the Welsh workforce. TVR's revival is also expected to boost tourism in the Ebbw Vale area, with visitors expected to come from around the world to see the cars being built. ""TVR is a global brand, and we expect to see visitors from around the world coming to Ebbw Vale to see the cars being built,"" said Mr Edgar.

A-level exam 'leak': Belfast grammar pupils sanctioned,"By Robbie Meredith, BBC News NI Education Correspondent Nine students at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution (RBAI) and Methodist College (MCB) are facing disciplinary action after an investigation into an alleged A-level exam leak, the BBC has learned. The investigation concerned the CCEA A2 business studies paper that was sat on 20 May. The exam watchdog, CCEA, confirmed it had launched an investigation after receiving information about potential breaches of exam regulations. The BBC understands that the students are suspected of having accessed the paper before the exam or shared information about its content during the test. A statement from RBAI said: ""The school has been made aware of allegations concerning the potential sharing of information about the CCEA A2 Business Studies Examination. The school takes any such allegations very seriously and is co-operating fully with the CCEA investigation."" MCB also confirmed it was co-operating with the investigation. The schools declined to comment further. CCEA said in a statement: ""CCEA takes all allegations of breaches of exam regulations seriously. An investigation is underway in relation to the A2 Business Studies exam held on 20 May 2022. No further comment will be made at this stage."" The alleged leak comes after a number of high-profile exam incidents in previous years, including the 2018 A-level exam fiasco, when thousands of students were left unsure of their grades due to a botched marking process. The Northern Ireland exam regulator, CCEA, has been under pressure to ensure this year's exams run smoothly, with many students and teachers expressing concerns about the impact of Covid-19 on teaching and learning. The exams were due to take place last year but were postponed due to the pandemic. Instead, students took a combination of assessments, including mock exams, coursework and end-of-topic tests. This year's exams began on 3 May and are due to continue until 24 June. They cover a range of subjects, including English literature, mathematics and the sciences. The allegations of an exam leak come as schools and colleges prepare their students for the final stages of their exams. The BBC understands that students have been warned not to share any exam information and to report any suspected breaches to their teachers or exam supervisors. The consequences of being caught up in an exam leak can be serious. Students may face disciplinary action, including being expelled from their school or college, and their exam results could be withheld. The CCEA investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear at this stage what action, if any, will be taken against the students suspected of being involved in the alleged leak.

Will Brexit last longer than other winning words of the year?,"The word had its first recorded use in 2013, but as the EU referendum approached, more and more people started using it. It's an increase that was unprecedented, reflecting the growing importance of the term in the political and social discourse of the time. The word, of course, is Brexit. Brexit, a portmanteau of British and exit, refers to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. The referendum to determine whether or not the UK should leave the EU was held on June 23, 2016, and the result was a shock to many. The UK voted to leave the EU with a narrow margin, with 51.9% of the votes in favor of Brexit. Since then, the term has become a constant presence in the news, in political debates, and in everyday conversations. It has been used to describe the negotiation process between the UK and the EU, the economic and political implications of Brexit, and the various challenges and opportunities that come with it. But Brexit is not unique in this regard. There have been other words that have captured the public's imagination and become synonymous with important events or trends in history. Words like 'perestroika,' 'glasnost,' 'apartheid,' 'globalization,' and 'recession' have all had their moments in the spotlight. So, the question remains: will Brexit last longer than other winning words of the year? It's a difficult question to answer definitively, as the significance and longevity of a word depend on a variety of factors, including the historical context in which it is used, the cultural and social relevance of the event or trend it represents, and the ongoing impact it has on the world. However, there are some reasons to believe that Brexit may indeed be a term that sticks around for a while. For one, the process of the UK leaving the EU is a complex and ongoing one, with many challenges and uncertainties still to be addressed. The negotiations between the UK and the EU are expected to continue well into 2020 and beyond, and the economic and political implications of Brexit are likely to be felt for years to come. Moreover, the UK's decision to leave the EU has already had ripple effects around the world, with other countries considering their own exit strategies from various international organizations and alliances. The rise of populist movements and nationalist sentiment in many parts of the world also suggests that the trend towards greater political autonomy and self-determination is not going away anytime soon. In conclusion, while it is impossible to know for sure whether Brexit will last longer than other winning words of the year, there are certainly reasons to believe that it will be a term that continues to shape the political and social discourse for some time to come. Whether it will be remembered as a defining moment",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Garden eels 'forgetting about humans' need people to video-chat,"Keepers at Tokyo's Sumida Aquarium, which has been closed since 1 March due to the coronavirus pandemic, are starting to worry about their garden eels. The usually lively and curious creatures have grown increasingly lethargic, spending most of their time buried in the sandy bottom of their tank. Garden eels, also known as hinge-backed eels, are a unique species of marine eels that are native to the Indo-Pacific region. They are named for their distinctive feeding behavior, where they poke their heads out of the sand to catch passing prey. The aquarium staff have noticed a worrying trend among the garden eels. They seem to have lost interest in their daily feeding sessions, and spend most of their time hidden in the sand. This behavior is unusual for the eels, who are known to be active feeders. The keepers believe that the lack of interaction with visitors might be the cause of the eels' lethargy. Normally, the aquarium attracts thousands of visitors each day, and the garden eels are known to be particularly popular. Visitors would gather around the tank to watch the eels as they poked their heads out of the sand to feed. The absence of human interaction might be causing the eels to feel unsettled and stressed, leading to their lack of appetite and lethargy. The keepers are concerned that this could have serious health consequences for the eels, who rely on regular feeding to survive. To try and address the issue, the keepers have started recording videos of themselves feeding the eels and playing the recordings near the tank. They hope that the sound and sight of food being presented might stimulate the eels to feed, even in the absence of human visitors. The keepers are also exploring other ways to provide stimulation for the eels. They are considering introducing new toys and decorations to the tank to encourage the eels to explore and interact with their environment. Despite these efforts, the keepers acknowledge that it will be a challenge to fully replicate the experience of human interaction. They are eagerly looking forward to the day when they can once again welcome visitors to the aquarium and allow the garden eels to entertain and delight them once more. In the meantime, the keepers are doing all they can to ensure the health and wellbeing of their garden eels. They are closely monitoring their behavior and health, and are working hard to provide them with the best possible care in these difficult times. The situation at Sumida Aquarium is just one example of the many challenges faced by aquariums and zoos around the world during the coronavirus pandemic. As they struggle to provide for their animals in the absence of visitors, these institutions are reminders of the important role that human interaction plays in the lives of many species, and the need for continued support and understanding.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Bat scientists find new evidence,"By Helen Briggs, BBC Environment correspondent They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand. And they predict that similar coronaviruses could be circulating in other bat populations around the world. The findings, published in the journal Science, come from a team of international scientists who have been studying bat coronaviruses for more than a decade. They found the virus in a bat at the Khlong Sam Sung wildlife sanctuary in Chonburi province. The discovery was made during a routine survey of bat populations for coronaviruses as part of an ongoing project to monitor the potential sources of future epidemics. The researchers say the virus is most closely related to the RaTG13 strain, which is the closest known relative to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 in humans. The team, led by Dr Poonam Khetarpal Singh from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the CDC, collected samples from more than 400 bats from 12 species during the survey. They found the virus in a single bat from the species Rhinolophus malayanus, which is common in south and southeast Asia. ""This finding is significant because it provides further evidence that bats are a major reservoir for SARS-related coronaviruses,"" said Dr Mohd Zaini Zainudin from the Universiti Sains Malaysia, who was part of the team. The researchers say the finding highlights the importance of continuing to monitor bat populations for coronaviruses. They also emphasise the need to reduce the risk of future outbreaks by reducing the contact between people and wildlife, particularly in areas where there is high human population density and close contact with wildlife. The team also predicts that similar coronaviruses could be circulating in other bat populations around the world, and calls for more research to identify and study these viruses. ""Understanding the origins of Covid-19 and other coronaviruses is crucial for preventing future outbreaks,"" said Dr Singh. ""Our study shows that continued surveillance of bat populations is essential for early detection and prevention of future zoonotic outbreaks."" The researchers say their findings also underline the need for greater investment in research into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and the role of wildlife in transmitting diseases to humans. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding the origins of zoonotic diseases and the role of wildlife in transmitting them to humans,"" said Dr Peter Daszak from EcoHealth Alliance, who was also part of the team.

Saudi Arabia hosts its first ever women's cycle race,"By Paul Harrison, BBC UGC and Social News Saudi women cyclists were able to compete in a race held in the city of Jeddah on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone in the kingdom's efforts to promote gender equality and challenge social norms. Forty-seven women participated in the 10-kilometre race, which was organised by the Saudi Cycling Federation in collaboration with the Jeddah municipal council. The event, which took place under the watchful eyes of Saudi Arabia's religious police, saw the women race against each other, wearing colourful cycling kits and helmets, with cheers and encouragement from the crowd. The race, which took place on a closed-off road, was a testament to the progress being made in the kingdom towards empowering women and promoting their participation in sports and physical activities. This is not the first time Saudi Arabia has made headlines for promoting women's sports. In December 2019, the kingdom hosted its first-ever women's football match, which saw the Saudi Arabian team play against South Korea. The match, which took place in the eastern city of Dammam, was attended by hundreds of women and girls, who were allowed to enter the stadium without the presence of a male guardian. But Tuesday's cycle race was particularly significant as it marked the first time women have been allowed to compete in a cycling event in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has long been criticised for its strict gender segregation rules and the restrictions placed on women's rights. The kingdom's religious police have been known to prevent women from participating in sports and physical activities in public, citing religious reasons. However, in recent years, the Saudi government has taken steps to challenge these social norms and promote gender equality. In 2018, the kingdom allowed women to attend sports events in stadiums for the first time, and in 2019, it granted women the right to drive cars. The cycle race in Jeddah is just the latest example of these efforts. The Saudi Cycling Federation, which organised the event, hailed it as a historic moment for women's sports in the kingdom. ""This is a new chapter in Saudi Arabian women's sports history,"" said Saleh Al-Masoud, the federation's president. ""We are proud to be part of this momentous occasion, and we look forward to seeing more women participate in cycling events in the future."" The participants in the race shared their excitement and gratitude for the opportunity to compete. ""I feel so proud to be part of this race,"" said Reem Al-Khaldi, a participant. ""It's a great feeling to be able to compete with other women and to show that we can do it."" The success of Tuesday's cycle race is a positive sign for the future of women's sports in Saudi Arabia.

Cholera death toll rises in hurricane-hit Haiti,"The news of the rising cholera death toll in hurricane-hit Haiti continues to be a cause for great concern as the ministry reported 59 fatalities and 617 new cases up until and including Thursday. This brings the total number of people affected by the outbreak to a staggering 7,359. The Caribbean country has been grappling with the cholera outbreak since October, and the situation has been worsened by the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which hit the country in early October, leaving behind a trail of destruction. The storm damaged water and sanitation systems, making it easier for the cholera bacterium to spread. The United Nations has warned that the number of cases could reach 10,000 by the end of the year if urgent action is not taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The organization has deployed additional staff and resources to support the Haitian government in its efforts to contain the outbreak. The conditions in some of the affected areas are particularly dire. In the southern part of the country, where Hurricane Matthew made landfall, many people are living in temporary shelters and have limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities. This puts them at a higher risk of contracting cholera. The disease is spread through contaminated water or food and can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. In severe cases, it can lead to kidney failure and death if left untreated. The Haitian government and its international partners have launched a response plan to contain the outbreak, which includes the distribution of chlorine tablets for water disinfection, the installation of temporary toilets, and the provision of oral rehydration solution to prevent dehydration. However, the resources needed to effectively address the situation are vast, and the response efforts have been hampered by the damage caused by the hurricane and the challenges of reaching some of the most affected areas. The international community has pledged millions of dollars in aid to support the Haitian government's response efforts, but it is unclear how much of that money will actually reach the country and how effectively it will be used. The situation in Haiti is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters and the importance of having robust water and sanitation systems in place to prevent the spread of diseases like cholera. It is a problem that goes beyond Haiti and affects many other countries around the world, particularly those in Africa and Asia. As the cholera death toll continues to rise in Haiti, it is essential that the international community steps up its efforts to support the country's response efforts and ensure that the necessary resources are made available to prevent further suffering and save lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Rail disruption caused by bad planning, Network Rail says","Thousands of passengers had their journeys disrupted when work near King's Cross station took longer than planned, causing a ripple effect on the entire rail network. The affected trains were redirected to Finsbury Park, a much smaller station, leaving many commuters stranded and frustrated. According to a report released by Network Rail, not enough was done to prepare for the potential delays and the subsequent switch of trains to Finsbury Park. The report detailed that the planning process for the engineering works near King's Cross failed to take into account the complexity and duration of the disruption. The engineering works, which were scheduled for a weekend, were meant to improve the infrastructure and enhance the overall railway performance. However, unforeseen complications arose during the works, causing the disruption to last much longer than anticipated. Network Rail acknowledged that they should have been more prepared for the potential delays and the impact they would have on the rail network. The report also highlighted that there was a lack of effective communication between Network Rail and the train operating companies, leading to confusion and delays in implementing alternative travel arrangements for passengers. Passengers who were affected by the disruption were left stranded and uncertain about how to continue their journeys. Some were forced to wait for hours at Finsbury Park station, while others were advised to travel to alternative stations or make arrangements for travel by other means. The disruption also had a significant impact on businesses and organisations that rely on the rail network for their daily operations. Many reported missed deadlines, lost productivity, and increased costs as a result of the delays. Network Rail has apologised to passengers for the inconvenience caused and has promised to learn from the incident to prevent similar disruptions in the future. They have also committed to investing in better communication and contingency planning to ensure that passengers are kept informed and that alternative travel arrangements are put in place promptly in the event of disruptions. The incident has highlighted the importance of effective planning and communication in managing rail disruptions and minimising the impact on passengers. It is a reminder that even the best-laid plans can be disrupted by unforeseen circumstances, and that it is essential to be prepared for such eventualities to ensure that passengers are kept informed and that their journeys are as smooth as possible. As the rail network continues to grow and evolve, it is crucial that the necessary resources and infrastructure are put in place to ensure that passengers are not unduly affected by disruptions. Network Rail and the train operating companies must work together to address the challenges posed by increasing passenger numbers and the need for ongoing infrastructure improvements, while ensuring that passengers are kept informed and that their journeys are as reliable and convenient as possible.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Catalonia Spain: Separatists set to boost majority in regional parliament,"With more than 99% of votes counted in Catalonia's regional elections, the separatist bloc is set to boost its majority in the parliament. The three pro-independence parties, Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia), and the CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy), are on course to secure 74 seats in the 135-strong assembly, up from 70 in the outgoing parliament. This significant increase in seats is a clear indication of the political will of Catalonia's voters to push for independence from Spain. The Spanish government, under Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, has repeatedly stated its opposition to any secessionist moves, and tensions between Madrid and Barcelona have long been simmering. The elections, held on February 14, were called after the Spanish Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to prison terms of up to 13 years for their role in organizing a banned independence referendum in 2017. The ruling sparked outrage in Catalonia and led to mass protests and calls for new elections to give separatist parties a fresh mandate. The pro-independence camp had already secured a majority in the last elections in 2017, but their rule was marred by political instability and a failed attempt to declare independence, which led to the imposition of direct rule from Madrid. The new mandate, however, could give separatist leaders the legitimacy they need to pursue their goal of independence more forcefully. The outcome of the elections is a clear message to Madrid that the separatist movement in Catalonia is stronger than ever. It also shows that the issue of Catalan independence is not going away anytime soon, and that the Spanish government will need to engage in meaningful dialogue with separatist leaders if it wants to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. The European Union, which has been closely watching the situation in Catalonia, has called for calm and urged all parties to respect the rule of law. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that the EU is ""ready to support Spain in its efforts to find a solution that respects the rule of law and the territorial integrity of Spain while also addressing the legitimate concerns of Catalonia."" The outcome of the Catalan elections is also a test for the Spanish prime minister, who came to power in 2018 on a promise to heal the wounds of the country's political crisis. SÃ¡nchez's center-left government has been trying to defuse tensions with Catalonia by offering dialogue and reforms, but his efforts have so far failed to win over the separatist camp. As the situation in Catalonia continues to evolve, the international community will be watching closely to see how Madrid and Barcelona respond to the new political reality in the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping,"In a legal notice served to the Mayor of London, Clean Air in London (CAIL) has requested that Sadiq Khan delays implementing his decision to scrap the London congestion charge until he can guarantee that air pollution levels will not worsen as a result. Mr. Johnson, Khan's predecessor, had initially introduced the congestion charge in 2003 as a means to reduce traffic and, consequently, decrease air pollution. CAIL argues that the removal of the charge could lead to increased traffic, resulting in an uptick in harmful emissions. The legal notice, which was sent to Khan's Greater London Authority (GLA) on the 25th of March, also calls for an urgent public consultation on the matter. CAIL, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving air quality in the capital, is concerned that the decision to abolish the charge was made without sufficient consideration for the potential impacts on public health. In a statement, CAIL's chief executive, Simon Birkett, expressed the organization's concerns, stating, ""The scrapping of the congestion charge will lead to more traffic, more congestion, and more pollution. The Mayor must delay his decision until he has carried out a proper assessment of the potential impacts on air quality and public health, and consulted with the public. We fear that the Mayor's decision is politically motivated and could harm the health of Londoners."" The GLA, however, has defended the decision to scrap the charge, arguing that it is outdated and disproportionately affects low-income households. A spokesperson for the GLA stated, ""The congestion charge is a relic of the past. It unfairly targets low-income Londoners who cannot afford to drive in the city centre. Instead, we are focusing on investing in public transport and encouraging active travel, such as walking and cycling, to reduce traffic and improve air quality."" Despite these assurances, CAIL remains concerned that the removal of the congestion charge could have detrimental effects on air quality in London. The organization is calling on the Mayor to reconsider his decision and to engage in a transparent consultation process with the public. The health of Londoners, they argue, should be the top priority. The legal notice serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle to improve air quality in London. While there have been significant strides made in recent years, with the introduction of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone and the phasing out of diesel vehicles, more needs to be done to ensure that the capital's air is safe for all. The scrapping of the congestion charge, CAIL argues, is a step in the wrong direction. As the legal process unfolds, CAIL and other organizations will be closely monitoring the situation.

Kim Kardashian: Studying law not about privilege or money,"Kim Kardashian, the renowned reality television star and businesswoman, revealed last week that she is embarking on a new journey towards becoming a lawyer. This unexpected announcement came as a surprise to many, as she will be taking her bar exam in 2022. However, Kim insists that her decision to delve into the legal field is not driven by privilege or monetary gains. During an interview on the ""Larry King Now"" show, Kim shared, ""I've always been interested in criminal justice reform, and I want to fight for people who have been wrongfully convicted and deserve a second chance. I've been studying this for a long time, and I've decided to take the next step and become a lawyer."" Kim's interest in criminal justice reform stems from her experiences working with the Innocence Project, an organization that helps exonerate prisoners through DNA evidence. She has been a vocal advocate for Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who was serving a life sentence for a non-violent drug offense before Kim intervened and helped secure her release in 2018. The reality star acknowledged that her platform and resources have allowed her to make a difference in people's lives, but she emphasized that her desire to become a lawyer goes beyond that. Kim shared, ""I want to be able to make a more profound impact and help change laws. I want to be an advocate for people who don't have a voice."" Critics have raised concerns about Kim's ability to become a lawyer given her lack of formal education beyond high school. However, Kim has been studying law through a program called ""The Study of Law Program"" offered by a California-based law firm, which has granted her the opportunity to take the bar exam. In response to her critics, Kim expressed her determination, stating, ""I know it's not the traditional route, but I'm up for the challenge. I'm studying really hard, and I'm confident that I can do this. I believe that anyone, regardless of their background or resources, can pursue their dreams and make a difference in the world."" With her unwavering commitment and determination, Kim Kardashian is proving that one's journey towards becoming a lawyer is not limited by privilege or financial means. Instead, it's about passion, dedication, and the desire to make a positive impact on the world.

Supreme Court divorce approval sought by 'unhappy wife',"Tini Owens, a resident of Broadway, Worcestershire, has set her sights on appealing the decision of the Supreme Court regarding her request for a divorce. At the age of 68, Tini feels that her marriage to Hugh Owens, who is 80, has reached its end. However, Hugh has chosen to contest the divorce, leading to the current impasse. The couple's marriage, which has spanned over four decades, has reportedly been fraught with difficulties for quite some time. Tini asserts that her husband's behaviour has driven a wedge between them, and she is now seeking to move on. However, her pleas for a divorce have been met with resistance from Hugh. In 2018, Tini initiated divorce proceedings, invoking the ""unreasonable behaviour"" ground for divorce. She outlined a series of allegations against her husband, suggesting that their marriage had irretrievably broken down. However, the court ultimately refused to grant her a divorce, ruling that the allegations she had made were not sufficient to meet the legal threshold for unreasonable behaviour. Tini was left dismayed by the ruling, feeling that her pleas for a separation had been dismissed. She believes that the decision is out of touch with modern realities and fails to acknowledge the true nature of her marriage. Tini's lawyers have since announced their intention to appeal the decision, arguing that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent and risks denying justice to other couples in similar situations. The case has garnered significant attention in the media, with many commentators expressing their support for Tini and her desire for a fresh start. Some have criticised the legal system for its inflexibility when it comes to divorce, arguing that it needs to adapt to the changing realities of modern relationships. Despite the controversy surrounding the case, Tini remains resolute in her pursuit of a divorce. She is determined to see the appeal through and hopes that it will pave the way for a fairer and more compassionate approach to divorce proceedings. In the meantime, she continues to live in the same household as her husband, waiting for a resolution to the legal impasse that has left her marriage in limbo. The outcome of this case is eagerly awaited by many, as it has the potential to set important legal precedents and shape the way that divorce is approached in the future. Tini's story serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in the process of ending a marriage, and the importance of ensuring that the legal system is responsive to the needs of those going through this difficult experience.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Don Lock murder: Mother of accused pleaded for help for son,"Matthew Daley, 35, stood in the dock at Lewes Crown Court, denying the charge that hung heavy over him: the murder of 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock. Yet, as the trial commenced, Daley's mother, Lynda, broke down in tears as she spoke of the day her son's life took a tragic turn. The courtroom was filled with a palpable sense of sorrow as Lynda Daley, a woman in her late sixties, took the stand. Her voice trembled as she recalled the day, just a few short months ago, when she had reached out to the authorities for help in regards to her troubled son. ""I begged them to do something,"" she sobbed, her eyes fixed on her son. ""I could see he was spiraling out of control, and I thought if they could just get him the help he needed, we could prevent all of this."" Lynda Daley went on to describe in heart-wrenching detail how her son, whom she had loved and cared for all her life, had been struggling with mental health issues for years. She had watched him cycle through various treatments and medications, but nothing seemed to quell the darkness that had taken hold of him. On the day of the incident, Mrs. Daley said she had received a frantic call from her son, pleading with her to come and collect him. He indicated that he had gotten into a dispute with an elderly man in the town, but could not provide any further details. Fearing the worst, Lynda Daley arrived at the scene to find her son in a state of agitation, visibly distraught. She urged him to come home with her, but Matthew Daley refused, insisting that he needed to stay and sort things out. ""I begged him to come with me,"" Lynda said through tears. ""But he was so adamant that he needed to stay. I left him there, and I wish with all my heart that I had never let him out of my sight."" It was only hours later that the full extent of the tragedy became clear. The police arrived at the scene to find the lifeless body of Donald Lock, his head brutally attacked. Matthew Daley was soon apprehended, and the horrifying truth began to emerge. As the trial continued, the court listened intently as the prosecution outlined the events of that fateful day. In a twist of fate, Matthew Daley himself took to the stand, acknowledging his actions but pleading for mercy on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Fortnite pro Jarvis banned for using cheat software,"Jarvis Khattri, a renowned Fortnite pro player, found himself in hot water recently after being banned from the game for using cheating software. Despite the fact that Mr. Khattri used the software only in private matches and not in competitive play, Fortnite creator Epic Games imposed the ban without warning. The incident came to light when a fellow player reported Mr. Khattri's suspicious behavior during a private match. The game's anti-cheat system, known as Fortnite Anti-Cheat (FAC), detected the software and flagged Mr. Khattri's account. However, the use of cheat software in private matches is a gray area in Fortnite's terms of service. Mr. Khattri, who goes by the handle ""Mom's SoMadSavage"" in the gaming community, was dismayed by the decision.

I can't believe I'm getting punished for something I did in a private match."" The Fortnite community reacted with a mix of sympathy and criticism. Some players rallied behind Mr. Khattri, expressing their agreement that the ban was unwarranted. Others argued that using cheating software, even in private matches, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the integrity of the game. Epic Games has been notoriously strict when it comes to cheating in Fortnite. The company has invested heavily in its anti-cheat technology and has a zero-tolerance policy towards cheaters. However, some players argue that the game's anti-cheat system can be overzealous at times, and that innocent players can get caught in the crossfire. Mr. Khattri has appealed the ban, and Epic Games has promised to review the case. In the meantime, he has taken a break from Fortnite and is focusing on other games. He remains hopeful that the ban will be lifted, but he has also learned a valuable lesson about the risks of using cheating software, even in private matches. The incident highlights the complex issues surrounding cheating in online games and the challenges of enforcing rules in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. It also underscores the importance of open communication between game developers and their player communities, and the need for a fair and transparent appeals process for banned players. As the gaming community waits for the outcome of Mr. Khattri's appeal, the debate continues about the role of cheating software in online games and the balance between fair play and individual freedom. With millions of players worldwide and a constantly evolving gaming landscape, these issues are likely to remain a hot topic for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Elaine Doyle murder: DNA samples could give clues to death,"Detectives used sticky tape to meticulously recover fibres from the dead girl's skin, found during the initial examination of Elaine Doyle's body. The fibres would later be sent to the lab for analysis in the hopes of identifying potential links to the perpetrator. But it was the discovery of something else that truly piqued the interest of the investigation team. Forensic experts believed that traces of DNA from ""an unknown male"" found on Elaine's back could prove to be a significant lead in the case. The DNA sample, small but potentially invaluable, was carefully extracted and preserved for further analysis. The lab technicians worked diligently, using advanced techniques to amplify the DNA and sequence the genetic material. As the results began to come in, the team held their breath in anticipation. The DNA was indeed from a male, but it was not a profile that was in their database or one that matched any of the potential suspects. Detective Inspector Johnston, the lead investigator on the case, was called to the lab to be briefed on the findings. He listened carefully as the forensic expert explained the implications of the DNA evidence. ""This is a potential breakthrough,"" he said, his voice filled with excitement. ""We now have a concrete lead that we can follow up on."" The team immediately began to look for any potential sources of the unknown male's DNA. They scoured the crime scene once more, re-examining every fibre, every trace of evidence, for any potential clues. They also began to canvass the local area, searching for anyone who might have come into contact with Elaine in the days leading up to her death. As the investigation continued, the team began to piece together a more comprehensive picture of Elaine's final days. They discovered that she had been seen leaving a local bar with an unknown man just a few nights before her body was found. The description of the man matched the build and height of the unknown male whose DNA was found on Elaine's back. Detectives began to focus their efforts on identifying this man, using CCTV footage and witness statements to build a profile of their suspect. The DNA evidence was a crucial piece of the puzzle, providing a tangible link to the unknown man and potentially bringing them one step closer to bringing the perpetrator to justice. As the investigation progressed, the team remained focused on the DNA evidence, using it to guide their investigation and piece together the events leading up to Elaine's tragic death. The small sample of genetic material had provided a crucial lead, and the team was determined to follow it through to the end.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Joe Anderson: Liverpool mayor in police probe will not seek re-election,"Mr Anderson, 62, made the announcement after Merseyside Police said he had been rebailed until February following his arrest earlier this month. The Liverpool mayor, who has been in office since 2017, made the decision not to seek re-election during the local elections in May, citing the ongoing police investigation as the reason for his decision. In a statement, Mr Anderson expressed his disappointment with the police and the impact the investigation was having on his family and the city. He said, ""I have always maintained my innocence and will continue to do so. I am deeply disappointed with the police's decision to rebail me and the continued focus on this matter. I have always endeavoured to serve the people of Liverpool with honesty and integrity, and I believe it is in the best interests of the city that I step down as mayor and focus on clearing my name."" The mayor's arrest came as part of an investigation into an alleged planning breach. Merseyside Police had earlier confirmed that they were investigating an allegation of misconduct in public office and that a man, later identified as Mr Anderson, had been arrested and released on bail. Since the arrest, Mr Anderson had maintained his innocence and called for the investigation to be concluded as quickly as possible. However, the decision to rebail him until February will prolong the uncertainty and speculation surrounding the case. The mayor's announcement came as a surprise to many in Liverpool and beyond. In recent days, there had been growing calls for Mr Anderson to resign, particularly from opposition parties. However, the mayor had refused to bow to pressure and had insisted that he would continue to serve the people of Liverpool. Mr Anderson's decision to stand down from the mayoral office will now pave the way for a contested mayoral election in May. It is expected that the Labour Party, which Mr Anderson represents, will nominate a new candidate to stand in his place. However, it remains to be seen whether the party will be able to maintain its hold on the mayoralty in the face of what is likely to be a closely contested election. Meanwhile, Mr Anderson's legal team has indicated that they will continue to cooperate fully with the police investigation and that he will continue to maintain his innocence. The investigation is likely to rumble on for some time yet, casting a long shadow over Liverpool's political landscape. In the meantime, the people of Liverpool will be looking for a new mayor to lead the city through its challenges and opportunities. It remains to be seen whether the next mayor will be able to match the energy and passion that Mr Anderson brought to the role during his time in office. One thing is for sure, however, the next few months will be a critical period for Liverpool's political leadership, and the city's residents will be watching with great interest.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Bristol disabled cyclist accused of 'riding drunk',"Nik Royale, a disabled cyclist from Bristol, found himself in an unexpected predicament while riding on a local track. As he navigated the unfamiliar terrain, he grew disoriented and asked a passing cyclist for assistance. The response he received took him by surprise. ""Go home, you shouldn't be riding drunk,"" the cyclist called out to him. Shocked and offended, Nik, who has cerebral palsy, swiftly corrected the misunderstanding. ""I'm not drunk, I'm just a bit lost,"" he explained. Despite his clarification, the incident left Nik feeling humiliated and frustrated. He took to social media to share his experience, expressing his disappointment and calling for greater awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by disabled cyclists. ""I can't believe what just happened,"" Nik wrote on Facebook. ""I've been cycling for years, and this is the first time someone has assumed I was drunk based on my disability. It's not just embarrassing, it's discriminatory and offensive."" Nik's post soon went viral, garnering support from thousands of people who were appalled by the incident. Many shared their own experiences of being mistaken for intoxicated due to their disabilities, while others offered words of encouragement and solidarity. The incident also caught the attention of local authorities, who assured Nik that they take incidents of disability discrimination seriously and would look into the matter. ""I'm glad that my experience has raised awareness of this issue,"" Nik said in a statement. ""But it shouldn't take a viral post for people to understand that making assumptions based on someone's disability is wrong. We all deserve respect and dignity, regardless of our abilities."" The incident also sparked a wider conversation about the importance of inclusion and accessibility in cycling and beyond. Organizations such as the Disabled Riders UK and the Cyclists with Disabilities Network called for greater efforts to be made to ensure that disabled cyclists are able to ride safely and without fear of discrimination. ""We need to do more to educate people about the realities of disability and the challenges that disabled cyclists face,"" said a spokesperson for Disabled Riders UK. ""It's important that we create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected, regardless of their abilities."" As the conversation continued, Nik remained hopeful that his experience would lead to positive change. ""I'm not looking for an apology, I just want people to understand that assumptions based on disability are hurtful and wrong,"" he said. ""I hope that this incident will serve as a reminder that we all have a role to play in creating a more inclusive and accessible world for everyone.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

The excitement was palpable as thousands of music lovers prepared to embark on a weekend of live music, camaraderie, and the unexpected. However, the celebrations were set to be tempered by the unfavorable weather conditions forecasted for the duration of the event. The Met Office had issued a yellow warning for rain, predicting heavy downpours throughout Thursday and potential flooding. Festivalgoers, who had braved the elements to secure their spots at the entrance, were met with a mixture of disappointment and resignation as they surveyed the ominous clouds overhead. Despite the looming gloom, the festival-goers remained undeterred. They donned their wellies and raincoats, and the air was filled with a sense of camaraderie as they shared stories of previous year's muddy escapades. The atmosphere within the site was electric, with the anticipation of the music to come serving as a beacon of hope against the backdrop of the impending storm. The first acts of the day took to the stages, drawing in crowds that huddled together under umbrellas or sought refuge under the cover of the marquees.

Tony Blair: Hard Irish border would be 'disaster',"The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has once again waded into the ongoing Brexit debates, expressing his concerns over the potential hardening of the Irish border. In an interview with the Irish Independent, Blair reflected on his time in office and the significance of the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Blair stated that he believed there was a ""common desire"" to make Northern Ireland a ""special case"" in Brexit negotiations. He emphasized that an open border had done a ""tremendous amount"" for UK and Irish trade, as well as fostering peace and reconciliation in the region. Blair's comments came as the UK and EU continue to negotiate the terms of their post-Brexit relationship, with the Irish border issue proving to be one of the most contentious points. The European Union has insisted that any Brexit deal must maintain the integrity of its single market, which includes the free movement of goods and people. The UK, on the other hand, has expressed its desire to regain control of its borders. Blair acknowledged the challenges posed by the Brexit negotiations but urged caution against a hard border. He emphasized the importance of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland, and the role that the open border played in its implementation. The former prime minister also highlighted the potential economic consequences of a hard border. He warned that it could lead to significant disruption to trade and investment, not just between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but also between the UK and the EU as a whole. Blair's intervention in the Brexit debate is not surprising, given his long-standing involvement in Northern Irish politics. He played a pivotal role in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 and has since remained a vocal advocate for peace and stability in the region. However, his comments are likely to be met with skepticism from some quarters. Brexit supporters argue that leaving the EU and regaining control of the UK's borders is a necessary step to take back sovereignty and restore democracy. They also point to the fact that other EU member states, such as Poland and Hungary, have closed their borders to migrants without facing the same level of criticism. Despite the challenges, Blair remains optimistic that a solution can be found to maintain an open border while respecting the UK's decision to leave the EU. He called for a ""creative and imaginative"" approach to the negotiations, one that recognizes the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland and the importance of preserving the peace process. In conclusion, Tony Blair's intervention in the Brexit debate underscores the significance of the Irish border issue and the potential consequences of a hard border. While acknowledging the challenges posed by the negotiations, Blair urged caution against a hard border and emphasized the importance of maintaining the open border for peace,",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Husband fears for her health,"Richard Ratcliffe's voice trembled with worry as he spoke to the BBC from his home in London. His wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian charity worker, had been imprisoned in Iran since April 2016, sentenced to five years for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. ""Nazanin's health is deteriorating rapidly,"" said Richard, his eyes filled with fear. ""She was already suffering from anxiety and depression before her imprisonment, but the stress and uncertainty of her situation have pushed her to the brink."" Nazanin's condition has been a source of concern for her family and friends for some time. According to her husband, she has lost a significant amount of weight and has been experiencing frequent panic attacks. Recently, she has been having trouble sleeping and has even attempted to harm herself. ""She's on the verge of a nervous breakdown,"" Richard said. ""It's heart-breaking to see her like this. All we want is for her to be released and to come home to us."" Nazanin's case has received widespread attention in the media and from political figures, including the British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who mistakenly stated that she had been teaching journalism in Iran, leading to her being questioned about alleged espionage activities. The Iranian authorities have since denied any involvement in her alleged confession. Richard has been campaigning tirelessly for his wife's release, traveling to Iran to visit her in prison and meeting with Iranian and British officials. He has also launched a petition calling for her release, which has gained over 800,000 signatures. Despite this, there is no clear sign of when or if Nazanin will be released. Her situation has become increasingly precarious in recent months, with her being denied access to essential medical treatment and being subjected to solitary confinement. ""We're very worried about Nazanin's safety,"" Richard said. ""The conditions she's being held in are inhumane, and her mental and physical health are suffering as a result. We just want her home, where she can receive the care and support she needs."" As the days pass, Richard's fear for his wife's safety and wellbeing grows. He is calling on the Iranian authorities to release her immediately, and on the British government to do everything in its power to secure her freedom. ""Nazanin is not a spy or a threat to the Iranian government,"" he said. ""She is a loving wife and mother, and she deserves to be reunited with her family. We will continue to fight for her release until she is finally home with us.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Kit Harington reveals family connection to the 'Gunpowder Plot',"In an intriguing turn of events, ""Game of Thrones"" star Kit Harington has revealed an unexpected family connection to one of the most famous plots in English history â the Gunpowder Plot. While Guy Fawkes is often erroneously regarded as the mastermind behind the attempted assassination of King James I in 1605, it was actually Robert Catesby who led the conspiracy. Harington, who gained global fame for his portrayal of Jon Snow in the hit HBO series, has expressed his desire to bring this family connection to life on the screen. The Gunpowder Plot was a failed assassination attempt against King James I and his government, carried out by a group of Catholic conspirators. The plot was discovered on November 5, 1605, when authorities found 36 barrels of gunpowder in a cellar beneath the House of Lords. Fawkes, a member of the conspiracy, was apprehended in the house and later tortured into revealing the details of the plot. However, recent historiographical research has shed new light on the true architect of the plot â Robert Catesby. Catesby was a prominent figure in the Midlands during the late Elizabethan era and was known for his staunch Catholicism. He was deeply disillusioned by the persecution of Catholics under the new king and saw the plot as a means to overthrow the Protestant regime and restore Catholic rule. Harington, who hails from Worcestershire in England, has learned that his ancestor, John Harington, was a cousin to Robert Catesby. John Harington was the godfather of Catesby's daughter, and the two families were closely intertwined. Kit has expressed his fascination with this connection and his desire to explore the complex motivations and emotions that drove Catesby to plan such a dangerous and ambitious plot. ""I've always been interested in English history, and discovering this connection to the Gunpowder Plot was a real surprise,"" Harington shared in an interview. ""Robert Catesby is such a fascinating figure â a man driven by deep convictions and a sense of injustice. I'd love to play him in a film or a TV series, to delve deeper into his mind and understand what made him take such drastic action."" The potential project would not only offer Harington a chance to explore his family history but also provide an opportunity to shed new light on the Gunpowder Plot and the man who led it. With his impressive acting skills and dedication to the craft, Harington is sure to bring Catesby to life in a way that captivates audiences and offers fresh perspectives on this pivotal moment in English history.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Reaction: Gravitational waves discovery,"Here's a selection of the reaction to news of the groundbreaking gravitational waves discoveries made by LIGO and Virgo collaborations. Brian Cox, Royal Society professor for public engagement in science, said: ""This is a very exciting discovery for two reasons. Firstly, it is a remarkable confirmation of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, which has been a cornerstone of modern physics for over a century. Secondly, it opens up an entirely new way of observing and studying the universe â through its gravitational waves."" Professor Sheila Rowan, the president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, shared Cox's enthusiasm, stating, ""This discovery is a game-changer in our understanding of the universe. With gravitational waves, we can now study the most violent and energetic events in the cosmos â black hole mergers, neutron star collisions â in ways that were previously impossible."" Nobel Laureate and physicist Professor Frank Wilczek from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology echoed their sentiments, adding, ""Gravitational waves are the ripples in space-time caused by accelerating massive objects. Their detection is a monumental achievement, overcoming many technical challenges, and it will provide us with a new window on the universe, opening doors to discoveries that will undoubtedly reshape our understanding of the cosmos."" The European Gravitational Observatory (EGO), which houses the Virgo detector, released a statement saying, ""This is a significant milestone for gravitational wave astronomy. The Virgo collaboration has played a vital role in the detection of these waves, contributing to the refinement of the analysis techniques and the improvement of the sensitivity of the instrument."" Even the usually reserved scientific community couldn't contain their excitement, with the director-general of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), Federica Mogherini, expressing her delight, ""This is an extraordinary achievement, demonstrating the power of international scientific collaboration. Today's announcement is a testament to the dedication and persistence of the LIGO and Virgo teams, and it opens up a new era in astronomy and physics."" Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who attended the press conference announcing the discovery, was characteristically reserved, but still expressed his enthusiasm, remarking, ""This discovery is a great breakthrough, and it opens up new possibilities for exploring the universe and understanding its deepest secrets."" These reactions reflect the universal sense of wonder and excitement surrounding this monumental discovery. Gravitational waves herald a new era in astronomy, allowing us to observe and study the universe in ways that were previously unimaginable. The potential implications are vast, from deepening our understanding of black holes and neutron stars to shedding light on the early universe and even the nature of dark matter and dark energy.

August Bank Holiday: Where to avoid on roads and rail,"Major work on the railways will mean no trains in or out of London Euston on Saturday and Sunday, causing disruption for thousands of commuters and holidaymakers planning to travel by rail during the August Bank Holiday weekend. This closure affects services to and from the Midlands, North West, and parts of Scotland. Passengers are advised to check their journey plans with National Rail Enquiries before setting out, as alternative transport options may be limited. Meanwhile, on the roads, the vast majority of roadworks on motorways were completed or lifted by Friday morning. However, there are still some areas where motorists should exercise caution. The M1 in Bedfordshire between Junction 13 and Junction 14 will have narrow lanes in place for ongoing resurfacing works, which may result in delays. The M25 anti-clockwise between Junction 23 and Junction 22 will also have lane closures for drainage work. Furthermore, the A14 in Suffolk will have a full closure eastbound between the A11 and the B1126, from Friday night until Monday morning. This closure is for essential bridge maintenance works, and drivers are advised to plan their journeys accordingly. Elsewhere, there will be several other road closures and restrictions across the country, particularly in areas with ongoing construction projects. The Department for Transport's website provides detailed information on these closures and recommended alternative routes. Air travel may be an alternative option for those looking to avoid the disrupted roads and railways. However, with many people also opting for flights, passengers are advised to check in early and allow extra time for security checks and potential delays. In summary, the August Bank Holiday weekend will bring some disruption to travel plans, particularly for those relying on the railways and the M1 and M25 motorways.

Subsidy for non-existent flights costs Stormont Â£2.3m a year,"By John Campbell, BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The deduction was part of the deal which allowed long-haul air passenger duty (APD) to be devolved in Northern Ireland, but it seems that subsidy for non-existent flights is costing the region's assembly, Stormont, a significant amount of money every year. According to figures obtained by BBC News NI, the Northern Ireland Executive paid out Â£2.3 million in 2019-2020 to cover the cost of APD for flights that never took off. The payments were made to airlines, despite the absence of any passengers or actual flights. The Executive's Finance Minister, Conor Murphy, confirmed the figure, stating that the payments were a result of the devolution deal struck between the UK and Northern Irish governments. He added that the UK Treasury had agreed to compensate the Northern Ireland Executive for the loss of revenue. However, the scale of the payments has raised eyebrows, with some critics questioning why taxpayers' money is being spent on non-existent flights. The DUP's Economy Spokesperson, Gordon Lyons, described the situation as ""unacceptable"" and called for an explanation from the Executive. ""The fact that we're seeing millions of pounds being paid out for flights that never even got off the ground is a cause for concern,"" he said. ""This is public money, and the Executive has a responsibility to ensure that it is being spent in a transparent and accountable way."" A spokesperson for the Department for the Economy (DfE) told BBC News NI that the payments were an ""unintended consequence"" of the devolution deal and that the UK Treasury was currently reviewing the issue. ""The DfE is working closely with the UK Treasury to resolve this matter as soon as possible,"" they said. ""We remain committed to ensuring that the Northern Ireland Executive receives the full devolution of air passenger duty revenues in line with the agreement."" The issue of non-existent flights subsidies is not a new one, with similar situations having been reported in other parts of the UK. However, the scale of the payments in Northern Ireland has put the spotlight on the issue once again. The Northern Ireland Executive has not yet provided a timeline for when the issue will be resolved or how the money will be recovered. In the meantime, critics are calling for greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. The devolution of long-haul APD was seen as a significant step towards greater economic autonomy for Northern Ireland. However, the issue of non-existent flights subsidies highlights the need for careful administration and oversight of devolved powers. As the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive continue their discussions on the issue, it remains to be seen how they will address the issue of subsidies for non-existent",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coroner in plea to Shropshire Council over river safety,"The body of Hayden Reynolds-Evans, an 18-year-old resident of Shrewsbury, was found in the River Severn in the town on a chilly March morning. The tragic discovery was made by a passerby near the town's Quarry Park, sending shockwaves through the local community. Coroner John Ellery, who oversaw the inquest into Hayden's death, has now written an open letter to Shropshire Council, urging action to improve river safety and prevent future tragedies. In his letter, Coroner Ellery expressed his deep sympathies to Hayden's family and friends, who continue to grieve over the loss of their loved one. He also acknowledged the efforts of emergency services personnel who worked tirelessly to recover Hayden's body and support his family in the aftermath of the incident. However, the coroner did not shy away from addressing the underlying cause of Hayden's death - the danger posed by the River Severn. Coroner Ellery noted that the river has been a source of concern for many years, with several incidents of drowning reported in the area. He highlighted the fact that the river's strong currents and deep waters can be particularly hazardous, especially for young people who may underestimate the risks. The coroner called on Shropshire Council to take urgent action to improve the safety of the River Severn, particularly in areas where it is known to be a popular spot for swimming and other water activities. He suggested that the council consider installing warning signs, setting up a safety education campaign, and working with local schools and community groups to raise awareness of the dangers. Coroner Ellery also urged the council to consider implementing physical measures to make the river safer. He suggested the installation of safety fencing and barriers, as well as the provision of lifeguards during peak swimming seasons. The coroner acknowledged that these measures would come with a cost, but argued that the potential benefits in terms of saving lives and reducing the emotional toll on families and the community are invaluable. The letter concluded with a plea for the council to take swift and decisive action to improve river safety in Shrewsbury. Coroner Ellery urged the council to act before another tragedy occurs, and to work in partnership with the community to ensure that the River Severn can be enjoyed safely by all. The letter has been widely shared in the local media, and has sparked a public debate about the safety of the River Severn and what more can be done to prevent such tragedies in the future.

Welsh A&E waiting time target missed again,"The latest figures from the Welsh government reveal that 85.9% of patients in Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments were treated within four hours in April, an improvement on the 84.3% recorded in March. However, this figure falls short of the Welsh Government's target of 95% and the NHS England and Improvement's standard of 95% set for the rest of the UK. The Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust reported a total of 31,125 attendances in April, with 26,688 of those patients being treated within four hours. The remaining 4,437 patients had to wait longer, some for several hours. These figures come as no surprise to healthcare professionals, who have been warning of the strain on A&E departments for months. The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health and care organisations in Wales, has called on the government to invest more in healthcare to meet the demands of an ageing population and rising health needs. The British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales has also expressed concern, with Dr David Bailey, BMA Cymru Wales chair, stating: ""A&E departments are under huge pressure and it's clear that the four-hour target is no longer achievable in most places. The government needs to invest in the NHS and social care to ensure that patients receive the care they need, when they need it."" The Welsh Government has acknowledged the issue, with Health and Social Services Minister Vaughan Gething stating: ""We recognise that there are challenges with meeting the four-hour target in A&E. It's important to remember that the four-hour target is just one measure of performance. We are committed to improving the experience of patients and reducing waiting times, and we will continue to work with health boards to address the issues."" The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has urged the government to address the root causes of the problem, including staffing shortages and bed blocking. Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""The four-hour target is a useless metric. What we need to focus on is ensuring that emergency departments have the resources they need to provide safe and effective care to all patients."" As the pressure on A&E departments continues to mount, there are growing calls for urgent action from the Welsh Government to address the underlying causes of the long waits and improve the overall experience for patients. The failure to meet the four-hour target is a sign of a larger issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address the challenges facing the NHS in Wales.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

International GCSEs to be axed from school league tables,"The change is part of the government's overhaul of the exam system in England. New GCSEs in maths and English language and literature, which were first introduced in 2015, will no longer be included in school league tables from 2024. The announcement was made by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson in a speech to the Confederation of School Trusts on Monday. He stated that the league tables had led to an ""unhealthy focus"" on these particular qualifications, and that the reform was necessary to ensure a more balanced curriculum. ""International GCSEs have an important role to play in our education system, and we want to recognise and celebrate their value,"" Mr Williamson said. ""That is why we are removing them from league tables and allowing schools the flexibility to choose which qualifications best suit their students' needs."" International GCSEs are globally recognised qualifications that are designed to be taken by students who are planning to study in English-speaking countries. They are broadly equivalent to the GCSEs taken by students in England, but are assessed, administered and awarded outside of the UK. The decision to remove International GCSEs from league tables has been welcomed by some educationalists, who argue that the current system puts too much pressure on schools to focus on specific qualifications at the expense of a broader curriculum. ""The current league tables have led to a narrow focus on a few subjects at the expense of others,"" said Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. ""This is a welcome step towards a more balanced approach to assessment and accountability."" However, others have expressed concern that the removal of International GCSEs from league tables could lead to a decrease in the number of students taking these qualifications. ""International GCSEs play an important role in preparing students for further study and work in English-speaking countries,"" said Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. ""It is important that schools are given the flexibility to continue offering these qualifications, but we need to ensure that this does not lead to a decline in take-up."" The government has also announced that it will consult on changes to the way that vocational qualifications are included in league tables, with a view to making the system fairer and more inclusive. The changes to the exam system come as the government prepares to introduce new qualifications in subjects such as maths, English and science, which will be based on a more rigorous and challenging curriculum. These qualifications, which will be awarded from 2023, will be graded on a 1 to 9 scale, with 9 being the highest grade. ""These reforms will ensure that our exam system is fit for the future, and that we are preparing students for the opportunities and challenges of the modern world,"" Mr Williamson said.

Scottish Gin Society rapped over Facebook adverts,"Complaints over 10 ""light-hearted"" Facebook posts by the Scottish Gin Society (SGS) have been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). It ruled the ads encouraged excessive drinking and implied alcohol could improve mood or concentration. The posts, which featured gin cocktails and tasting notes, were shared between December 2020 and March 2021. The ASA received several complaints that the ads were irresponsible and could encourage harmful drinking. One complainant said the posts ""normalised excessive drinking"" and another expressed concern that they ""could be seen as promoting alcohol as a solution to stress or anxiety."" In its ruling, the ASA said the ads must not appear again in their current form. It stated that while the SGS's disclaimer, which appeared on each post, made it clear that alcohol should be consumed responsibly, the posts themselves could still be seen as encouraging excessive drinking. The SGS, which has over 7,000 members, was disappointed by the ruling. In a statement, it said: ""We are saddened that the ASA has taken this decision as our intention was always to promote the responsible enjoyment of gin. We will now review our social media content to ensure that it complies with the ASA's guidelines."" The ASA's ruling comes at a time when there is growing concern about the impact of social media on alcohol consumption. A recent study by the University of Sheffield found that social media use was linked to an increased likelihood of binge drinking among young people. The study, which was published in the journal Addiction, found that young people who spent more time on social media were more likely to engage in binge drinking. The researchers suggested that this could be due to the way social media platforms are designed to encourage constant engagement and the normalisation of excessive drinking in online communities. The SGS, which was founded in 2013, is just one of many groups and organisations that use social media to promote alcohol. While many of these groups have a responsible approach to alcohol promotion, others can be more problematic. The alcohol industry as a whole has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with concerns being raised about the way it markets its products, particularly to young people. In response, the industry has promised to take a more responsible approach to alcohol promotion, but critics argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of harmful drinking. The ASA's ruling against the SGS is a reminder that even seemingly harmless social media posts can have unintended consequences. It also highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to alcohol promotion online. As the debate around alcohol marketing continues, it is important that social media platforms and organisations take a responsible approach to alcohol promotion. By doing so, they can help reduce the harm caused by excessive drinking and promote a healthier, more balanced approach to",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Neo-Nazi group led by 13-year-old boy to be banned,"By Daniel De Simone, BBC News Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced the banning of Feuerkrieg Division (FKD), an international Neo-Nazi group that had claimed earlier this year that it had dissolved. The group, which largely existed online, had attracted widespread attention when it was revealed that it was being led by a 13-year-old boy from the United Kingdom. The Home Office said in a statement that the group had been banned under the Terrorism Act 2000, following an assessment by the police and security services. The ban prevents the group from operating in the UK and makes it a criminal offence for individuals to invite support for or to become a member of the organisation. FKD had gained notoriety for its extremist views, including promoting hate speech against Jewish people, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other minority groups. The group had also reportedly encouraged violence and terrorism. The ban comes after pressure from civil society organisations and politicians, who had called on the government to take action against the group following reports of its existence and activities. ""The ban of the Feuerkrieg Division is a necessary step to protect our communities from the harmful and dangerous ideologies that this group espoused,"" Patel said in a statement. ""We will not tolerate hate speech or extremist behaviour, and we will take swift and decisive action against those who seek to spread it."" The ban also applies to any affiliated groups or individuals, and the Home Office said it would take action against anyone who continues to support or promote the group's ideology. The decision to ban the group was welcomed by community groups and advocacy organisations, who expressed relief that action was finally being taken against the group. ""We have seen the devastating impact that far-right extremist groups can have on individuals and communities,"" said a spokesperson for the Community Security Trust, a Jewish advocacy group. ""The ban of the Feuerkrieg Division is a positive step towards creating a safer and more inclusive society for all."" However, some critics have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the ban, and whether it will truly prevent the group's ideology from spreading. Others have called for more resources to be devoted to preventing and countering extremist ideologies, and for greater efforts to be made to address the root causes of extremism. Regardless, the ban represents a significant moment in the ongoing fight against extremism and hate speech, and sends a clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated in the UK. The Home Office has urged anyone with information about the group or its activities to report it to the police or to the charity Hope Not Hate, which has set up a dedicated reporting hotline for extremist content online.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Self-employed bailout âproblematicâ,"By Faisal Islam, Economics Editor Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has acknowledged the challenges in extending the same level of support to the self-employed as he did for employees in his recent coronavirus bailout package. Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Sunak refused to commit to a timeline for providing assistance to the self-employed, stating that the current scheme has ""its own complexities and challenges."" Sunak reiterated that the government's priority was to protect jobs and support businesses, but he acknowledged the difficulties in applying the same terms to the self-employed as he did for employees. The Chancellor had previously announced a Â£350bn support package, which included an extension of the furlough scheme for employees, but the self-employed have been left out of this scheme thus far. The self-employed make up around 15% of the UK workforce, and many have been hit hard by the economic fallout from the pandemic. They have been calling for similar support to that given to employees, but the government has yet to announce a clear plan for how it intends to help them. Sunak has previously faced criticism for the lack of support for the self-employed, with some arguing that the government's measures have been inadequate and have left many people in a precarious financial situation. The Chancellor has said that he is considering various options, including extending the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, which currently provides grants of up to Â£2,500 per month, but many argue that this is not enough to cover the costs of living for many self-employed individuals. The delay in announcing a comprehensive package for the self-employed has caused uncertainty and anxiety among those who are most in need of support. The Freelands Group, which represents the freelance, self-employed, and small business community, has called for the government to provide a clear timeline for when self-employed people can expect to receive support. The government has announced several other measures to support businesses and individuals during the pandemic, including business rate relief, grants for small businesses, and loans for larger firms. But the lack of a clear plan for the self-employed has left many feeling left behind. Sunak has promised to do everything in his power to support businesses and individuals through the crisis, but the self-employed sector is one area where the government's response has been criticized for being inadequate. With the economic impact of the pandemic set to last for some time, it is essential that the government provides a comprehensive package of support for the self-employed to prevent long-term damage to the sector and the wider economy. Sunak's reluctance to commit to a clear timeline for supporting the self-employed has raised concerns among many in the sector, who fear that they will be left behind",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Windows 7 hardest hit by WannaCry worm,"More than 97% of the infections seen by Kaspersky Lab and 66% of those seen by BitSight in the WannaCry ransomware attack used the older software, Windows 7, according to recent reports. WannaCry started spreading in mid-May and, so far, has infected more than 200,000 computers around the world. Windows 7, which was released in 2009, has long since been surpassed by newer versions of Microsoft's operating system. However, it remains a popular choice among businesses and individuals due to its stability and familiarity. Despite this, Microsoft ended its support for Windows 7 in January 2020, leaving users without the latest security patches and updates. The WannaCry worm, also known as WannaCrypt or WCry, exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows related to the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The vulnerability, known as EternalBlue, was originally developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and leaked online in April 2017. Microsoft issued a patch for the vulnerability in March 2017, but many users, particularly those using older versions of Windows, did not install it. The WannaCry attack spreads through email attachments and malicious links, as well as through the EternalBlue exploit. Once inside a network, it can spread rapidly, encrypting files on infected computers and demanding a ransom in the form of Bitcoin to restore access. The attack can cause significant damage, both in terms of data loss and the cost of remediation. The fact that Windows 7 is the most affected operating system in the WannaCry attack is a stark reminder of the importance of keeping software up to date. Microsoft has issued patches for all supported versions of Windows, including Windows 7, but users must apply them manually. Microsoft also released a free tool, the Windows 7 Extended Security Updates, to help protect Windows 7 users until April 2023. The WannaCry attack is not the first time Windows 7 has been targeted. In 2017, the NotPetya ransomware attack also primarily affected Windows 7 users. NotPetya, which was disguised as ransomware but in fact was a destructive worm, spread through a software update from the Ukrainian tax software MeDoc. The WannaCry attack serves as a reminder that cybersecurity is an ongoing process, not a one-time event. It is essential to keep software up to date, use strong passwords, and be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links. Businesses and individuals must also invest in cybersecurity training and tools to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. In conclusion, the WannaCry ransomware attack, which has infected more than 200,",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Neil McEvoy: Commission reconsiders decision to recognise new party,"The Electoral Commission is reconsidering its decision to officially register the Welsh National Party (WNP), following a threatened legal challenge by Plaid Cymru. Neil McEvoy, the leader of the WNP, has expressed his disappointment at the commission's initial decision and has accused Plaid Cymru of trying to stifle democratic opposition. At the heart of the issue is the WNP's eligibility to be recognized as a political party under UK electoral law. The Electoral Commission, which is responsible for overseeing elections and registering political parties, initially determined that the WNP did not meet the threshold for registration due to insufficient evidence of support from the public and local government. However, Mr McEvoy and his supporters argue that the WNP has gained significant momentum in recent months, with growing membership and support in the Welsh communities. They point to the party's successful participation in local council elections and its strong showing in the 2019 European Parliament elections, where it secured over 3% of the votes. Plaid Cymru, the dominant political force in Welsh politics, has long been critical of the WNP and has been vocal in its opposition to the party's registration. The party argues that the WNP's ideology and policies are divisive and potentially harmful to Welsh interests. Plaid Cymru's legal challenge to the Electoral Commission's decision was based on the argument that the commission had erred in its assessment of the WNP's support base. The Electoral Commission has now announced that it will re-examine the evidence presented by both the WNP and Plaid Cymru and make a final decision on the party's registration in due course. The commission has emphasized that it is an independent body and that its decision will be based on the merits of the case and the evidence presented. Mr McEvoy has welcomed the decision to reconsider the registration application and has called on the commission to make a fair and impartial assessment of the WNP's eligibility. He has also urged his supporters to remain calm and patient, while expressing his disappointment at Plaid Cymru's efforts to prevent the democratic process from taking its course. The outcome of the Electoral Commission's decision will have significant implications for Welsh politics, potentially paving the way for a new political force in the region or reinforcing the dominance of Plaid Cymru. Regardless of the outcome, the debate surrounding the WNP's registration highlights the complexities of democratic representation and the challenges of balancing the interests of different political forces in a diverse and evolving political landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Soap bubble screen is 'the world's thinnest display',"An international team of researchers has made a groundbreaking discovery in the world of display technology, creating a device that uses ultrasonic sound waves to manipulate the properties of a soap bubble film, making it the world's thinnest display. The team, composed of experts from the University of Cambridge, the University of Sussex, and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, has published their findings in the journal ""Nature Communications"". The bubble mixture used in this innovative technology is a simple solution of soap and water, but the way it is manipulated is anything but ordinary. The researchers used ultrasonic transducers to send sound waves through the bubble solution, causing the surface of the bubbles to vibrate and change shape. These vibrations alter the refractive index of the film, creating either a flat or a 3D image, depending on the frequency and intensity of the sound waves. The team's findings have significant implications for the future of display technology. Traditional displays, such as LCD and OLED screens, have limitations in terms of size, weight, and power consumption. The soap bubble screen, on the other hand, is incredibly lightweight and uses very little power. It can be easily scaled up to create large displays or even flexible screens, making it an attractive alternative to current display technologies. Moreover, the soap bubble screen has the potential to offer improved image quality. The team was able to create 3D images with a high level of detail and resolution, which could lead to significant advancements in fields such as medical imaging and virtual reality. The researchers also noted that the soap bubble screen has other potential applications. For example, it could be used as a sensitive pressure sensor, as the vibrations of the bubbles can be measured to detect even small changes in pressure. It could also be used as a sonar system, as the ultrasonic waves can be used to detect objects in the surrounding environment. The team is now working on optimizing the technology to make it more practical for everyday use. They are exploring ways to make the bubbles more stable and to improve their response time to the ultrasonic waves. They are also working on developing a system to generate the ultrasonic waves in a more efficient way, which would further reduce the power consumption of the display. In conclusion, the international team's discovery of a soap bubble screen that uses ultrasonic sound waves to create flat or 3D images is a significant breakthrough in the field of display technology. The lightweight, energy-efficient, and scalable nature of the technology makes it an attractive alternative to current display technologies, with potential applications ranging from medical imaging to virtual reality. The team is continuing to work on optimizing the technology to make it more practical for everyday use, and the future of this innovative technology looks bright indeed.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Child sex abuse inquiry: Priest 'tried to control' investigation,"A former North Yorkshire detective, who worked on investigations into child sex abuse at Ampleforth College in 1995 and 2002, has claimed that officers were ""excluded"" from the inquiries and that the former head teacher, Father Leo O'Donovan, tried to control the investigations. Speaking to the BBC, the detective, who asked to remain anonymous, said that when they first arrived at the college to investigate allegations of abuse in 1995, they were met with a ""wall of resistance"" from the monks and the school's leadership. According to the detective, Father O'Donovan attempted to control the investigation by limiting the access of officers to students and by withholding crucial information. The detective also claimed that they were not allowed to interview certain students without the presence of a monk. ""We were being obstructed at every turn,"" the detective said. ""It was clear that the college was trying to protect itself and the individuals involved."" The detective's claims come after a recent investigation by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA) which found that Ampleforth College failed to protect children from sexual abuse between the 1970s and the late 2000s. The IICSA report detailed numerous allegations of sexual abuse at the college, including rapes, indecent assaults, and the possession and distribution of child abuse images. The report also found that senior figures at the college, including Father O'Donovan, were aware of the abuse but failed to act. Father O'Donovan, who was head teacher at Ampleforth College from 1988 to 2002, has previously denied any knowledge of abuse at the school during his tenure. However, the IICSA report states that he was informed of allegations against several monks during this period but did not report them to the police. The detective's account of the investigations in 1995 and 2002 adds to the growing body of evidence that the college failed to act on allegations of abuse and that efforts were made to obstruct investigations. The detective also criticised the police response at the time, stating that they did not have the resources or the expertise to deal with such complex cases. ""We were dealing with a powerful and well-connected organisation,"" the detective said. ""We needed more support and we needed it sooner."" The detective's claims have been echoed by survivors of abuse at Ampleforth College, who have spoken of their frustration at the failures of the authorities to protect them and bring their abusers to justice. The IICSA report has called for a cultural change in the way that child abuse is investigated and for greater resources to be made available to police forces and local authorities.

FE funding body threat over sixth form involvement,"Colleges Wales, the body representing further education (FE) institutions in Wales, has raised concerns that its support for a new funding commission may be withdrawn if school sixth forms are not included in its remit. The new body, which is set to replace the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), would oversee the distribution of funding for both FE and higher education (HE) institutions in the country. In a statement, Colleges Wales emphasized the importance of FE colleges' involvement in the delivery of A-level and other level 3 qualifications, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic. The body argued that the current system, which sees some school sixth forms receive funding directly from the Welsh Government, creates an unfair competitive advantage and hinders efforts to ensure parity between different providers. ""We cannot support the creation of a new funding body that fails to acknowledge the role and contribution of colleges in the Welsh education landscape,"" said Iestyn Davies, Chief Executive of Colleges Wales. ""Our institutions are an integral part of the education system, and it is essential that they are treated fairly and equitably in terms of funding."" The announcement comes after a lengthy consultation process, during which stakeholders from both the FE and HE sectors were invited to provide feedback on the proposed new funding arrangements. The Welsh Government has yet to announce the final composition and remit of the new body, with a decision expected imminently. The concerns raised by Colleges Wales have been echoed by other FE bodies, including the Sixth Form Colleges' Association (SFCA) and the Association of Colleges (AoC). Both organizations have argued that the exclusion of school sixth forms from the new body's remit would result in a fragmented and unbalanced system, with FE colleges being unfairly disadvantaged. ""We understand that the Welsh Government is seeking to streamline the funding system and create a more efficient and effective process for distributing resources,"" said Bill Rammell, Chief Executive of the AoC. ""However, it is crucial that this is achieved in a way that recognizes the value and contribution of all providers, and does not create unnecessary divisions between different sectors."" The developments come at a time when the FE sector in Wales is grappling with the challenges posed by the pandemic and the ongoing need to adapt to a rapidly changing educational landscape. With schools and colleges facing significant financial pressures, there are concerns that the exclusion of school sixth forms from the new funding body could exacerbate existing inequalities and hinder efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of FE provision. As the debate over the new funding arrangements continues, stakeholders on all sides will be closely watching the Welsh Government's next moves. With the future of FE funding in Wales hanging in the balance, the need for a fair and equitable system has never been greater.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Dinas Dinlle beach erosion plan unveiled,"It is believed that a flood defence built to protect Dinas Dinlle near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, from coastal flooding in 1994 has made the problem worse. Environment Agency Wales was outlining its plans for addressing the erosion issues at the beach on a recent visit. The sea defence, which runs parallel to the coastline, was designed to prevent the encroachment of the Irish Sea into the village and its surrounding farmland. However, the structure has reportedly caused the beach to erode at a faster rate than it would have naturally. The defence has trapped sediment and shingle behind it, starving the beach in front of it of essential nutrients and protective material. The Environment Agency acknowledged the concerns and stated that they intend to remove a section of the sea defence to enable the natural restoration of the beach. The plan involves the removal of approximately 200 metres of the sea defence, allowing the sea to reclaim the land and replenish the beach. The proposal has been welcomed by local residents and conservation groups, who have long expressed their concerns about the impact of the sea defence on the beach's health. The RSPB, which manages the nearby Dinas Oleu nature reserve, has endorsed the plan, stating that it will help to improve the habitats for wading birds and other coastal species. The removal of the sea defence is expected to begin later this year, with work scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023. The Environment Agency plans to monitor the progress of the beach's natural restoration closely, with regular surveys and assessments to ensure that the project is having the desired effect. While the removal of the sea defence is a positive step towards addressing the erosion issues at Dinas Dinlle, it is not a long-term solution. The ongoing impact of climate change and rising sea levels means that more comprehensive and sustainable solutions will be required to protect the area from future flooding and erosion. The Environment Agency is currently working on a coastal management plan for the Caernarfon area, which will outline the measures needed to mitigate the risks of coastal flooding and erosion in the long term. In the meantime, the agency is urging residents and visitors to take care when visiting the beach, especially during stormy weather conditions. The erosion issues mean that the beach is prone to sudden and unexpected changes, with the risk of cliffs collapsing or large waves sweeping people off their feet. The Environment Agency advises that visitors should always check the tide times and weather conditions before heading to the beach, and should avoid venturing too close to the water's edge.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hobbit fans given taster of new Peter Jackson film,"The taster, showing Martin Freeman in the role of young Bilbo Baggins, is among a number of trailers released this week for 2012's big films. A trailer for Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises set social media ablaze with excitement, but it was Peter Jackson's The Hobbit that had the dedicated fans of Middle-earth in a frenzy. The brief clip, released on Monday, gave viewers a tantalizing glimpse into the world of hobbits, elves, and dragons. The opening shot shows a young Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) standing in front of his cozy hobbit-hole, looking out at a grey and ominous sky. A knock at the door interrupts his contemplation, and he opens it to find Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) standing on his doorstep. The scene cuts to Bilbo and Gandalf walking through the Shire, surrounded by rolling green hills and quaint hobbit holes. Gandalf explains to Bilbo that he has been chosen by the wizard Saruman to lead a group of dwarves on a dangerous quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the treasure guarded by the dragon Smaug. Bilbo hesitates, unsure of his abilities, but eventually agrees to join the adventure. The trailer ends with Bilbo and Gandalf standing before a vast, dark forest, and the ominous voice of Gollum (Andy Serkis) whispering, ""My precious."" The fans were left wanting more, and the internet was soon filled with speculation and analysis of the trailer. The Hobbit films, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novels of the same name, have been eagerly anticipated by fans since rumors of their production began circulating several years ago. Jackson, who directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is returning to the world of Middle-earth to bring The Hobbit to life. The first film, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is set to be released in December 2012, with the second film, The Hobbit: There and Back Again, following in December 2013. The response to the trailer has been overwhelmingly positive, with fans praising Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo and the stunning visual effects.

Cardiff Airport: Bristol backs Wales Euro 2020 bid,"preparing to support Cardiff Airport in accommodating the influx of fans expected during Wales' participation in Euro 2020. The footballing body, Uefa, has instated a rule that each hosting city must have a minimum of two airports to maintain crowd security and prevent potential clashes between rival supporters. Although Cardiff Airport is the primary airport catering to the Welsh capital, its proximity to the bustling city centre and limited expansion capabilities make it an unsuitable option for accommodating the anticipated surge in passenger traffic during the tournament. This is where Bristol Airport steps in, located approximately 50 miles (80km) to the west and poised to provide much-needed relief. Bristol Airport has a well-established reputation for handling large volumes of passengers, especially during major events like the annual Balloons Festival and the West Country's busiest tourist season. Its capacity and infrastructure are well-equipped to handle the crowds that will inevitably flock to Wales during Euro 2020. ""We are committed to working closely with Cardiff Airport and the Welsh Government to ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all fans travelling to Wales for Euro 2020,"" said a spokesperson for the airport. ""We are confident in our ability to accommodate the additional passenger numbers and provide the necessary facilities and services to make their journey as convenient as possible."" Besides its capacity, the airport offers ample parking, excellent transport links to Cardiff and other major cities in Wales, and a wide range of amenities for passengers. Furthermore, its strategic location makes it easily accessible to fans travelling from both England and the rest of Europe. Bristol Airport's support is crucial to Cardiff's bid to host Euro 2020 matches, as the joint effort will allow the city to meet Uefa's stringent requirements and provide an unforgettable experience for fans attending the games. With the airport's commitment to collaborate and the Welsh Government's ongoing efforts to enhance transportation networks, Cardiff now has a viable solution to ensure the safety and convenience of visiting fans during the tournament. The partnership between Cardiff and Bristol Airports is an excellent example of collaboration and adaptability in the face of logistical challenges posed by major sporting events. This collaboration not only reinforces the region's ability to host large-scale events but also underscores its commitment to providing an exceptional experience for fans travelling to Wales for Euro 2020.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
London Underground: How does the Tube compare globally?,"By Nick Tarver, BBC News Transport for London (TfL) has announced that every ticket office on the Tube is to shut by 2015, with the loss of around 900 jobs. This move, aimed at saving Â£50m a year, has sparked controversy and raised questions about how the London Underground compares to other metro systems around the world. Around the globe, cities from Seoul to Shanghai, Stockholm to Singapore, have invested heavily in modernising their metro networks. Many have maintained a visible presence of staff at ticket counters and manned platforms to assure passenger safety and provide assistance. The London Underground, which opened in 1863, is the world's oldest subway system. It has long relied on a staffed ticketing system, but other cities have turned to automated systems to reduce costs and streamline operations. In Seoul, for instance, the subway system is completely automated, with ticket vending machines at every station. A similar scene can be found in Shanghai, where automated ticket machines are standard, and staff are only present to offer assistance or sell tickets to tourists. The London Underground's shift towards automation began in 2007, when the Oyster card was introduced, an electronic fare payment system that does not require human interaction at ticket offices. However, the Tube still maintains a significant number of manned ticket offices. TfL argues that the London Underground is still competitive, with the system carrying over 2.6 million passengers daily, more than any other metro system in Europe. But the closure of all ticket offices will mean that passengers will be required to buy tickets in advance, online, at ticket machines, or on buses. Some critics have voiced concerns about the safety implications of eliminating ticket offices, especially as the London Underground is one of the busiest metro systems in the world. In 2005, a fire at King's Cross St. Pancras Station, which did not have a ticket office, killed 31 people. The London Underground's decision to close all ticket offices is not unique. In Paris, the MÃ©tro has been entirely automated since 2017. However, the Paris MÃ©tro retains a large number of station agents to provide customer assistance and ensure safety. In contrast, London's Transport for London plans to eliminate all staffed ticket offices, leaving only staffed gates and ticket machines. TfL claims that this will not affect passenger safety, but critics argue that removing the human presence from ticket offices could lead to increased incidents and accidents. In conclusion, the London Underground's decision to close all ticket offices is part of a global trend towards automation in metro systems.

European Commission predicts 'turning point' in Europe,"The European Commission has released its latest economic forecast, predicting a ""turning point"" for the European economy. The Commission said there were ""signs of hope"" that had started to turn into ""tangible positive outcomes."" However, the road to recovery is expected to be long and uneven, with significant differences between various European countries. In the eurozone - the 18 nations that use the euro - the Commission predicted growth of 1.1% for 2021. This is an upward revision from the 0.8% growth forecast in its winter prediction. The improvement is mainly due to the successful rollout of vaccines and the gradual easing of lockdown measures. However, there are significant variations between countries. For instance, the economies of Germany, France, and Italy are expected to grow by 3.8%, 5.2%, and 4.2%, respectively. In contrast, the economies of Portugal, Greece, and Spain are predicted to grow by only 2.8%, 3.6%, and 3.8%, respectively. The Commission attributed the uneven recovery to the different levels of vaccination progress, the severity of the third wave of the pandemic, and the varying degrees of fiscal and structural reforms. It called on governments to continue their efforts to support the recovery, particularly through fiscal measures and structural reforms. Outside the eurozone, the Commission predicted a moderate recovery for the EU as a whole. The EU economy is expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021, up from the 3.3% growth forecast in the winter prediction. The Commission said the improvement was mainly due to the strong performance of the manufacturing sector and the services sector, which is expected to recover faster than previously anticipated due to the successful rollout of vaccines. However, the Commission warned that the recovery could be derailed by several risks, including the emergence of new virus variants, geopolitical tensions, and the possibility of a disorderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. It urged European countries to continue their efforts to contain the spread of the virus and to work together to address common challenges. The Commission also highlighted the need for structural reforms to increase productivity, improve competitiveness, and create jobs. It called on EU countries to invest in digitalization, green technologies, and education to prepare for the future. The Commission said that by working together, European countries could overcome the challenges and seize the opportunities of the digital and green transitions to build a stronger and more resilient European economy. In conclusion, the European Commission's latest economic forecast provides a glimmer of hope for the European economy, predicting a turning point in the recovery. However, the road to recovery is expected to be long and uneven, with significant differences between various European countries. The Commission called on European countries to continue their efforts to support the recovery, particularly through fiscal measures and structural reforms,",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Second footballer comes forward over abuse at Crewe Alexandra,"Steve Walters, the former Crewe Alexandra player who holds the distinction of being the club's youngest debutant in 1988, has joined ex-team-mate Andy Woodward in speaking out about the physical and sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of a coach during their time at the football club. Walters, who made his debut for Crewe at the tender age of 16, described the culture of fear that pervaded the club during the 1980s and 1990s under the guidance of former coach Bob Lawton. Lawton, who has previously been accused of sexually abusing several players, denies any wrongdoing. Walters told the Guardian that the abuse began when he was just 14 years old and that it continued until he left the club at the age of 20. He described how Lawton would frequently single him out for punishment, both during training sessions and in the changing rooms. ""It started with verbal abuse, but it soon turned physical,"" Walters said. ""He would push me, pull my hair, and hit me with a water bottle. It was all designed to humiliate me in front of my team-mates. But it didn't stop there."" Walters went on to describe how Lawton would also make sexually explicit comments and would touch him inappropriately in the shower after training. He said that he was too afraid to report the abuse to anyone at the time, fearing that he would be punished even further if he spoke out. ""I didn't tell anyone because I was scared,"" Walters said. ""I thought I was the only one going through this. I didn't want to be singled out any more than I already was. I just wanted to get through each day and focus on my football."" Walters' revelations come just weeks after Woodward went public with his own experiences of abuse at the hands of Lawton. Woodward, who played for Crewe between 1988 and 1993, has described how Lawton would touch him inappropriately in the changing rooms and would make him perform sex acts on him. The Football Association (FA) has launched an investigation into the allegations against Lawton, who denies any wrongdoing. Crewe Alexandra has also announced that it will be conducting its own internal investigation into the matter. The revelations have sparked a national conversation about child sexual abuse in football and the culture of silence that has long existed within the sport. The FA has announced that it will be setting up a new independent body to investigate historical allegations of abuse in football, while the government has confirmed that it will be launching a review of safeguarding in sport. Walters has urged other survivors of abuse to come forward and speak out. ""I know it's not easy to talk about these things,"" he said. """,Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Saudi blogger Raif Badawi flogging postponed second time,"Last week, Saudi Arabian blogger Raif Badawi was scheduled to receive the second instalment of his controversial sentence: 1,000 lashes. However, the implementation of this punishment has been postponed for an undisclosed reason. No reason has been given, but Mr Badawi was reported to be physically unfit to face the penalty after receiving the first flogging. He was flogged in public in the city of Jeddah on January 9, 2015, in front of a large crowd. The first 50 lashes were administered, after which he was given a break, allowing him to stand and rest. However, after the second round of 50 lashes, he was unable to continue. He was reportedly taken to hospital, with his condition described as critical. The news of Badawi's condition sparked a wave of international condemnation, with human rights organizations and world leaders expressing their concern. Amnesty International called on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately halt the punishment and release Badawi. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the Saudi government to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in prison in 2013, following a trial that was criticized by human rights organizations for being unfair. He was charged with ""insulting Islam"" and ""founding a liberal website"". The charges stemmed from his writing on the website ""Free Saudi Liberals,"" which he established in 2008. The website, which has since been shut down, was a platform for Saudi Arabians to discuss political and social issues. Despite the international outcry, the Saudi Arabian authorities have given no indication that they will change their stance on Badawi's sentence. The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs has defended the punishment, stating that Badawi's actions were in violation of the country's laws. The postponement of Badawi's second flogging has raised questions about the Saudi Arabian authorities' intentions. It is unclear whether they will carry out the remainder of the sentence at a later date or whether they will revoke it altogether. However, the fact that Badawi's condition has been cited as a reason for the delay has raised concerns about his wellbeing and the potential long-term effects of the punishment on his health. The case of Raif Badawi has highlighted the ongoing issue of human rights in Saudi Arabia. Despite its significant oil wealth and strategic importance, the country has been criticized for its restrictive laws and lack of respect for fundamental freedoms. The international community has called on the Saudi Arabian authorities to reform their legal system and ensure that human rights are respected. The ongoing situation with Badawi serves as a reminder of the urgent need for change. In the meantime, Badawi remains in prison, his future uncertain.

Australia ministers submit new higher education bill,"Senators voted against the higher education reform bill on Tuesday night by a narrow margin of 33 votes to 31. The legislation, which had been a contentious issue in Australia for months, would have seen significant changes to the funding and fee structures of universities. The bill, which had been proposed by the government, aimed to address the increasing cost of higher education and reduce the budget deficit. However, opposition parties and educational institutions argued that the proposed cuts to university funding would have a detrimental effect on the quality of education and accessibility for students. Under the proposed reforms, universities would have been allowed to set their own fees for some courses, leading to concerns of a two-tier education system and rising student debt. The government argued that this would encourage competition and innovation within the higher education sector, but critics saw it as an attempt to privatize education. The vote came after a marathon debate in the Senate chamber, which saw passionate speeches from senators on both sides of the debate. Opposition senators argued that the reforms would disproportionately affect low-income students and regional universities, while government supporters insisted that the changes were necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the higher education system. The defeat of the bill was seen as a significant victory for the opposition and educational institutions, who had mounted a strong campaign against the reforms. However, the government has indicated that it will not give up on the issue and is expected to bring forward a new bill in the coming weeks. The vote also comes at a time when higher education is under greater scrutiny in Australia, with concerns about the cost of degrees, the quality of graduates, and the value of a university education in an increasingly competitive job market. The government and opposition will now need to work together to find a solution that addresses these concerns while ensuring that higher education remains accessible and affordable for all Australians. The defeat of the bill is likely to be met with relief from students, educational institutions, and many in the community who had expressed concerns about the impact of the proposed reforms. However, the issue is far from over, and it remains to be seen what form the government's new bill will take and how it will be received by the Senate and the wider community. In the meantime, students and educational institutions will continue to press for a higher education system that is accessible, affordable, and of high quality, while the government will be under pressure to find a way to address the financial challenges facing the sector without compromising the future of Australian education.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sherlock: Praise for 'perfect' series finale,"The Guardian's Lucy Mangan called Sherlock's latest instalment, His Last Vow, ""perfect."" In her review, she praised the series finale for its ""ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence,"" setting it apart from previous episodes. Mangan was not alone in her praise, as the Daily Telegraph's Serena Evans also weighed in with her thoughts, declaring it ""the best of the lot."" Mangan was particularly impressed with the way the writers managed to tie up loose ends and provide satisfying resolutions for the characters. ""Sherlock's evolution over the past few series has been a delight to watch,"" she wrote, ""and His Last Vow was the perfect culmination of that journey."" Evans echoed this sentiment, noting that the episode ""had all the hallmarks of classic Holmes - the intricate plotting, the clever deductions, and the unexpected twists."" But what truly set it apart, she argued, was the way it ""breathed new life into the character, showing him in a light we've never seen before."" Critics were also quick to praise the performances of the show's lead actors. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes was, as always, masterful, with Martin Freeman's Watson providing the perfect foil. ""Cumberbatch's performance was, as ever, a tour de force,"" Mangan wrote, ""but Freeman held his own, delivering a nuanced and compelling portrayal of a character often relegated to the sidelines."" The production values were also singled out for praise. The episode's cinematography was stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the story. The action sequences were thrilling, and the set designs were intricate and atmospheric. ""Sherlock has always been a visual feast,"" Evans noted, ""but His Last Vow took that to a whole new level."" But it wasn't just the critics who were impressed. Fans of the show took to social media to express their delight at the finale. ""I've been a fan of Sherlock since the very beginning, and this was by far the best episode yet,"" one fan tweeted. ""I was on the edge of my seat the entire time!"" Another added, ""The way they brought all the storylines together was brilliant. I was in tears by the end."" With its clever writing, stunning production, and captivating performances, His Last Vow was a fitting farewell to one of television's most beloved characters. As Mangan put it, ""Sherlock may be over, but it will be remembered as a perfect example of how to do a series finale right.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pound falls as Theresa May indicates Brexit date,"It was a turbulent week for the British pound as it continued to slide against major currencies, hit by renewed uncertainty over the Brexit negotiations and Prime Minister Theresa May's confirmation that the process to leave the European Union would begin by the end of March. The pound took a nosedive on Monday, hitting its lowest level against the dollar since the beginning of July, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the potential economic impact of Brexit. The pound also weakened against the euro, with one euro buying as much as 0.86 pounds. The prime minister's announcement on Sunday that she would trigger Article 50 by the end of March was seen as increasing the likelihood of a so-called ""hard Brexit,"" with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union. This prospect has raised concerns among businesses and investors about the potential disruption to trade and supply chains. ""The pound is under pressure as the prospect of a hard Brexit becomes more likely,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank. ""The uncertainty is weighing on investor sentiment and making it difficult for them to commit to holding pounds."" The political uncertainty was compounded by a lack of clarity over the timeline for the Brexit negotiations. European leaders have indicated that they will not begin discussions on the UK's future relationship with the EU until after Article 50 is triggered and the two-year negotiation period has begun. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has warned that Brexit could result in a sharp slowdown in economic growth, with inflation rising and unemployment increasing. The bank has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.25% in an effort to support the economy, but some economists have called for a rate hike to help bolster the pound. However, others argue that a rate hike could backfire by making it more expensive for businesses to borrow and potentially slowing down economic growth further. Instead, some investors are looking to the US Federal Reserve for clues on when it might raise interest rates, which could help boost the dollar and pressure the pound. Despite the challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the pound's prospects. ""The pound is oversold and due for a rebound,"" said Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at ACLS Global. ""As the Brexit negotiations progress, we may see some clarity emerge and the pound could recover some ground."" But for now, the pound remains under pressure, with investors keeping a close eye on developments in the Brexit negotiations and any new economic data that could provide fresh insights into the UK's economic outlook.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Stonehenge tunnel 'would cause devastation',"Kate Fielden, a local resident living in the tranquil countryside near the world-renowned ancient monument of Stonehenge, expressed her deep concern over the recently approved plan to construct a two-mile (3.2km) tunnel along the A303 to alleviate traffic congestion. ""I've lived here for over three decades, and the peace and serenity that this place offers have always been a source of solace for me,"" Kate began, her voice filled with emotion. ""But now, I fear that the very essence of Stonehenge and its surrounding landscape will be destroyed."" The landscape, she explains, is not just a backdrop to the iconic monument; it is an intrinsic part of its character. The rolling hills, the verdant fields, and the winding country lanes have remained unchanged for centuries, providing a picturesque setting that has drawn visitors from all corners of the globe. However, to create the proposed tunnel, the landscape would need to be ""gouged out,"" according to Kate. ""The thought of bulldozers tearing through the fields and hills, excavators digging up the earth, and the constant noise and disruption of construction traffic is a devastating prospect,"" she continued. The potential destruction of the landscape is not the only concern for Kate and her community. They also worry about the impact the tunnel could have on the ancient monument itself. Stonehenge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the most important prehistoric monuments in the world. Its exact origins and purpose remain a mystery, but its significance to our past is undeniable. The tunnel would not only disrupt the monument during the construction process but also potentially for generations to come. The increased traffic along the A303, which would be a direct result of the tunnel, could lead to more air pollution and noise pollution â both of which could harm the delicate stones and the ecosystem around Stonehenge. Moreover, the tunnel project has faced opposition from various archaeological and environmental organizations, who argue that it could lead to the discovery of important historical sites that could provide invaluable insights into our past. Despite these concerns, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps approved the project, stating that it was necessary to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. However, Kate and her community believe that there are other, less destructive, solutions to this problem. They propose improving public transport, encouraging carpooling, and implementing a congestion charge in the area. As Kate looks out at the sun setting over the fields, casting long shadows over the landscape, she can't help but feel a sense of sadness. She fears that the proposed Stonehenge tunnel could lead to the destruction of a piece of our cultural heritage, one that has stood the test of time for thousands of years.

Night Manager finale beats Queen at 90 by 1m TV viewers,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE NIGHT MANAGER The Night Manager, an updated version of John Le CarrÃ©'s 1993 novel, has been a major success for BBC One this year, drawing in large audiences with its gripping storyline and star-studded cast. The six-part series, which concluded last night, managed to outperform the much-loved Queen Elizabeth II documentary, 'The Queen at 90', by a significant margin. According to overnight ratings, an average of 6.8m viewers tuned in to watch the final episode of The Night Manager, with an impressive peak audience of 7.8m. This was a remarkable increase from the previous episode, which attracted an average of 5.8m viewers. ITV's documentary, which began an hour earlier, did beat BBC One's Antiques Roadshow, which averaged 4.9m viewers. However, it was no match for the suspenseful and thrilling finale of The Night Manager. The series, which was adapted for the screen by Tom Shankland and starred Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, and Olivia Colman, follows the story of former British soldier, Jonathan Pine, who becomes the night manager of a Cairo hotel in order to infiltrate the inner circle of wealthy arms dealer, Richard Roper, played by Laurie. The final episode saw Pine finally confronting Roper and exposing his criminal activities to the authorities, leading to a tense and explosive showdown. The scene in which Pine and Roper faced off in the hotel room was particularly gripping, with Hiddleston and Laurie delivering strong performances that left viewers on the edge of their seats. The Night Manager's success can be attributed to a number of factors, including its engaging plot, strong performances, and high production values. The series also benefited from the timely subject matter, as it explored themes of corruption, power, and loyalty in the context of the international arms trade. The Night Manager's conclusion was a fitting end to a series that had kept viewers hooked from the very first episode. The final scene, in which Pine boards a plane to London, ready to start a new life, left audiences feeling satisfied but also eager for more. It remains to be seen whether The Night Manager will be renewed for a second series, but one thing is clear - the show has left a lasting impression on viewers and has solidified its place as one of the standout dramas of the year.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ikea looks set to open more small stores in the UK,"Ikea, the renowned Swedish furniture retailer, is considering expanding its small-format stores across the United Kingdom, following the success of its first such shop in Greenwich, London. UK boss Javier Quinones described the London shop as a ""learning experiment,"" but its impressive sales performance and customer feedback suggest that the format is likely to expand to other cities. The concept, known as Ikea Planning Studios, is a departure from the giant blue-box stores that Ikea is famous for. These smaller outlets, which measure around 1,000 square metres (10,764 square feet), are primarily focused on selling selected home furnishing pieces and interior design advice. The absence of a restaurant or a showroom means that the stores can be located in more urban areas, often in high footfall locations. Quinones revealed that the Greenwich store welcomed over 1.5 million visitors in its first year, exceeding expectations. This success can be attributed to the store's strategic location and the convenience it offers to local customers. Ikea's UK boss believes that the store's success could be replicated in other UK cities, such as Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. ""The Greenwich store has been an excellent addition to our UK portfolio,"" Quinones stated. ""We've learned a great deal about how our customers shop and what they're looking for in a smaller format Ikea store. We're confident that this concept can be successful in other cities across the UK."" The smaller Ikea stores focus on offering a curated selection of home furnishing pieces, with a greater emphasis on digital services such as order-and-collect and home delivery. The stores also provide interior design consultations, enabling customers to visualise how furniture would look in their homes using augmented reality technology. Ikea's expansion plans echo the broader retail trend of smaller, more convenient stores that cater to urban customers. Retailers such as Lidl, Aldi, and Amazon have all announced plans to open smaller stores in city centres, aiming to offer a more accessible and convenient shopping experience. Quinones added, ""Our customers want flexibility and convenience, and we're committed to meeting their needs. Our smaller-format stores offer a more focused and personalised shopping experience, and we're looking forward to bringing this concept to more cities across the UK."" The success of the Greenwich store has not gone unnoticed by Ikea's competitors. Other retailers are expected to follow suit and introduce smaller, more urban formats to their stores. However, Ikea's first-mover advantage could give it a significant edge in the market, as it continues to refine and expand its smaller-format stores.

US Senate immigration bill starts debate,"The US Senate immigration bill, which has bipartisan support among its members, began a debate on the chamber floor this week. The bill, if passed, would provide a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States. However, the road to passage is far from guaranteed, as the legislation must also navigate the House of Representatives, where a different immigration bill is currently being negotiated. The Senate bill, known as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Modernization Act of 2013, includes a number of provisions aimed at addressing border security, workers' visas, and the status of undocumented immigrants. The legislation would require undocumented immigrants to pay fines, back taxes, and undergo background checks before being eligible for provisional status. They would then be able to apply for permanent residency and, eventually, citizenship. However, the bill faces significant opposition from conservative lawmakers, who argue that it does not do enough to secure the border before granting amnesty to undocumented immigrants. Some have threatened to filibuster the bill, which would require 60 votes to advance, making it a difficult prospect for supporters. Meanwhile, across the Capitol, the House is working on its own immigration bill. The House bill, which has yet to be formally introduced, is expected to take a more restrictive approach, focusing on border security and workplace enforcement before addressing the status of undocumented immigrants. The two bills are expected to diverge significantly, making it unclear how, or even if, they will be reconciled. Some observers have suggested that a conference committee may be necessary to work out the differences between the two pieces of legislation. The Senate debate comes as the immigration issue continues to dominate headlines and political discourse. Recent polls suggest that a majority of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but there is significant disagreement over how best to address the issue. Supporters of the Senate bill argue that it strikes a balance between securing the border and providing a fair and just solution for undocumented immigrants who have built lives in the United States. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the bill does not do enough to address the root causes of illegal immigration and would reward lawbreakers. As the debate continues, both sides remain deeply entrenched in their positions. The outcome of the Senate debate, and ultimately the fate of immigration reform, remains uncertain. One thing is clear, though: the issue is not going away anytime soon. The Senate debate is expected to last several days, with amendments being offered and debated. It remains to be seen whether the bill will be able to pass the chamber and move on to the House. Immigration reform is a complex and contentious issue, one that will continue to dominate headlines and political discourse in the coming weeks and months.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Auschwitz victim Jane Haining's relatives attend reunion,"The recently discovered document offers fresh insight into the life of Jane Haining from Dunscore, a Scottish woman who selflessly chose to stay and care for the children of her Jewish friends in the horrors of Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. The document, unearthed in the archives of the National Records of Scotland, details Jane's correspondence with her family and friends before her tragic death at the hands of the Nazis. Over the weekend, some 14 of Jane's relatives gathered in Edinburgh for a poignant reunion organized by the charity, the Jane Haining Foundation. They came together to honor their remarkable ancestor's legacy and to reflect on the courage and compassion she demonstrated in the face of unimaginable adversity. One of the attendees, Catriona Topping, shared her feelings about being connected to such an inspiring woman. ""Meeting other relatives and hearing their stories has been incredibly moving,"" she said. ""It's an emotional experience to learn more about our grandmother's life and the impact she had on others. Her unwavering commitment to helping others during those dark times continues to be a source of pride for our family."" Another relative, Andrew Haining, spoke about the significance of Jane's story in the context of history. ""Jane's story is a reminder of the terrible atrocities that were committed during the Holocaust and the importance of preserving the memories of those who suffered and those who went above and beyond to help others."" The reunion also featured a series of talks from scholars and representatives of the Jane Haining Foundation, who shed light on the historical context of Jane's actions and the implications of her story for contemporary issues. The guests were also treated to a performance from local schoolchildren, who recited poems and songs inspired by Jane's life and legacy. As the day drew to a close, the relatives shared a poignant moment of silence to remember Jane and the countless others who lost their lives during the Holocaust. They left the event with a renewed appreciation for their family's history and the enduring power of compassion and selflessness in the face of adversity. The discovery of this document and the subsequent reunion serve as a poignant reminder of the resilience and courage of individuals like Jane Haining during the darkest periods of history. Her story continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world, and her legacy as a symbol of hope and compassion endures.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Three-point turn may be dropped from UK driving test,"Under a revised practical exam, learners may also be asked to use a satellite navigation system instead of following road signs. About 1,000 learners will take part in a trial of the new test format, which includes this and other changes, starting in January 2023. The Department for Transport (DfT) announced the plans, which also include the potential removal of the three-point turn manoeuvre from the driving test. The move aims to make the test more representative of real-life driving, with a greater emphasis on safety-critical situations. This change has been met with mixed reactions from driving instructors and learners. The three-point turn has long been a staple of the UK driving test, requiring learners to reverse around a corner and complete a U-turn in a narrow space. However, some argue that it is an outdated requirement that does not reflect the actual driving experiences of many motorists. Instead, learners may be asked to demonstrate their ability to reverse into a parking bay or perform a bay park using a satellite navigation system. The DfT believes that these changes will prepare learners better for the road, as they will need to rely on modern technology and adapt to changing road conditions. The trial will take place at 22 driving test centres across the country, with the findings used to inform any future changes to the practical driving test. Other elements of the revised test include an increased emphasis on independent driving and an extended period of time for learners to complete the test. The changes come as part of a wider review of the driving test, which was launched in 2018. The DfT has said that it wants to ensure that the test remains ""fit for purpose"" in the modern world. However, some have raised concerns about the potential cost implications of the new test format, with the use of satellite navigation systems and additional equipment potentially adding to the overall cost of the test. Despite these concerns, the DfT remains committed to the changes, with Transport Minister Trudy Harrison stating that ""these updates to the driving test will help ensure that the next generation of drivers are equipped with the skills they need to stay safe on our roads."" The trial is set to begin in January 2023, with the results expected to be announced later in the year. In the meantime, learners and driving instructors will be watching closely to see how these changes will impact the practical driving test and the future of driver training in the UK.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Homeless mental health and drugs services 'broken' in Wales,"By Daniel Davies, BBC Wales Correspondent Funding is too low to effectively address the ""rough sleeping crisis"" in Wales, according to a committee report which also criticised a lack of leadership. Charities have called for ""radical action"" in response, including the provision of injecting rooms. The report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Housing and Homelessness in Wales painted a grim picture of the current state of mental health and drugs services for homeless people. It highlighted the urgent need for increased investment and better coordination between agencies. The APPG heard evidence from homeless charities and health officials, who described the current system as ""broken"". They warned that without significant reform, the number of people sleeping rough in Wales would continue to rise. One of the key issues raised in the report was the lack of mental health services for homeless people. It was noted that many homeless individuals suffer from mental health issues, but there are few resources available to help them. The report recommended the establishment of dedicated mental health teams for homeless people, but acknowledged that funding would be a major barrier. Another major concern was the lack of support for people addicted to drugs. The report advocated for the provision of injecting rooms, a controversial measure that has been implemented in some European cities. Supporters argue that these facilities can help reduce the number of drug-related deaths and improve public health, but opponents worry about the potential for increased drug use and crime. The report also highlighted the need for more shelter spaces, as well as better coordination between agencies. It was noted that many homeless individuals are not aware of the services that are available to them, or struggle to navigate the complex system. The report's author, Mark Isherwood AM, said that the situation was ""unacceptable"" and called for ""radical action"" to address the crisis. He urged the Welsh Government to invest more in mental health and drugs services for homeless people, and to work closely with charities and health officials to improve coordination and outreach efforts. The Welsh Government has yet to respond to the report's recommendations. In a statement, a spokesperson acknowledged the challenges facing mental health and drugs services for homeless people, but did not commit to any specific measures. For homeless individuals in Wales, the report offered little in the way of immediate relief. As they struggle to cope with the harsh realities of life on the streets, they can only hope that the recommendations in the APPG report will lead to meaningful change in the near future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Police 'outnumbered' by Middlesbrough and Newcastle sledging crowds,"Large crowds congregated to frolic on Newcastle's Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough on Wednesday and Thursday, as the annual sledging tradition returned despite Covid regulations. The scenes were reminiscent of a winter wonderland, with families and friends braving the cold to enjoy the thrill of hurtling down the snowy slopes on makeshift sledges. However, the sheer size of the crowds proved to be a challenge for the local police forces, who were outnumbered by the throngs of people. In Newcastle, an estimated 10,000 people descended upon Town Moor, while in Middlesbrough, the number of sledgers at Flatts Lane Country Park was reported to be around 5,000. With limited resources, the police struggled to maintain order and ensure social distancing measures were adhered to. Despite the challenges, the police remained committed to keeping the crowds safe. They patrolled the areas on foot and in vehicles, reminding sledgers to wear masks and maintain a safe distance from one another. They also worked to clear any potential hazards from the sledging slopes, such as debris and branches. The large turnout at the sledging events was a welcome sight for many, who have been cooped up at home due to the ongoing pandemic. For some, it was a much-needed break from the monotony of lockdown life. Others saw it as an opportunity to reunite with friends and family in a safe and socially distanced way. However, not everyone was thrilled about the return of the sledging tradition. Some residents expressed concerns about the potential for large gatherings to contribute to the spread of Covid-19. Others were frustrated by the disruption caused by the crowds, with reports of traffic congestion and parking problems in the surrounding areas. Despite the controversies, the sledging events were a testament to the resilience and spirit of the North East community. In a time of uncertainty and hardship, the crowds came together to create a sense of joy and fun. And while the police may have been outnumbered, they remained steadfast in their duty to keep everyone safe. As the sun began to set on the final day of sledging, the crowds slowly dispersed, leaving behind a trail of footprints and snowy memories. And while the pandemic may still be a looming presence, for a brief moment, the people of Newcastle and Middlesbrough were able to forget their worries and embrace the simple pleasures of winter.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
MPs doubt supermarket scheme to spot carers,"By Rebecca Keating, BBC News Sainsbury's has begun training staff to look for signs that customers may be caring for elderly or disabled people, in a bid to support unpaid carers and offer them assistance while they shop. The supermarket chain, which has over 1,300 stores in the UK, aims to identify carers through subtle cues and provide them with priority service and additional help. The scheme, which is being rolled out across all Sainsbury's stores, is part of a larger initiative to better understand and cater to the needs of unpaid carers, who provide vital support to over 6.5 million people in the UK, according to Carers UK. These carers save the economy an estimated Â£132 billion each year. Sainsbury's staff are being trained to recognise signs that a customer might be a carer, such as carrying a large number of items, or appearing stressed or anxious. They will also be on the lookout for customers who may need help with heavy shopping bags or loading their purchases into their vehicles. Sainsbury's has worked closely with Carers UK to develop this programme, which builds on the supermarket's existing Carer's Passport scheme. This scheme, which is offered to carers in partnership with over 100 retailers and businesses, provides carers with discounts, priority parking, and other special offers. According to Sainsbury's, the new training programme will help staff identify carers discreetly and offer them assistance that is tailored to their needs. This could include offering to pack their shopping, helping them load their car, or providing a quieter checkout area. Sainsbury's CEO, Simon Roberts, said: ""We know that unpaid carers face significant challenges in their day-to-day lives and we want to do everything we can to support them. By training our staff to identify carers and offer them additional help and assistance, we hope to make a real difference to their shopping experience."" Carers UK Chief Executive, Helen Walker, welcomed the announcement, saying: ""Carers are the unsung heroes in our communities, providing vital care and support to family members and loved ones. This new initiative from Sainsbury's is a great step forward in recognising and supporting unpaid carers and helping them to access the assistance they need when they need it."" The rollout of the new training programme comes as the UK grapples with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has placed additional pressure on unpaid carers and highlighted the need for greater support for this vital group. Sainsbury's is not the only retailer to take steps to support unpaid carers. Other major retailers, including Tesco and Asda, have also introduced similar schemes, recognising the important role that carers play in society and the need to support them in their daily lives.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Supreme Court to hear transgender school bathroom case,"The case before the Supreme Court on this day concerns a Virginia public school district attempting to uphold its policy of designating restrooms based on a student's biological sex at birth, rather than their gender identity. At the heart of this contentious issue is a 17-year-old transgender student, who was born female but identifies and lives as a male. The justices are expected to grapple with the complex interplay of privacy rights, anti-discrimination laws, and the rights of schools to maintain order and safety in their educational environments. The case, which originated from Gloucester County, Virginia, has garnered significant national attention as it raises fundamental questions about transgender rights and the balancing of competing interests. The student, referred to as G.G. in legal documents, has been attending Gloucester High School since the beginning of the 2014-2015 academic year. He had informed school officials of his gender identity and requested to use the boys' restrooms. However, the school board, citing concerns for the privacy and safety of other students, adopted a policy that required G.G. to use the girls' facilities. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Virginia took up G.G.'s case, arguing that the policy violated his rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. They also pointed out that the policy could lead to a hostile educational environment for transgender students, potentially causing harm to their mental and emotional well-being. In response, the Gloucester County School Board contends that it is acting in the best interests of all students by maintaining clear guidelines for restroom use. They argue that the policy is necessary to ensure privacy, prevent discomfort, and minimize potential conflicts. The school board also asserts that it is not discriminating against G.G. but is instead trying to maintain a safe and orderly educational environment. As the justices enter the courtroom, they will hear hours of arguments and deliberate on the merits of the case. They will consider the legal and factual complexities of the case, with each side presenting their interpretation of Title IX, privacy rights, and the rights of transgender students. Ultimately, their decision will set an important precedent for the treatment of transgender students in schools across the country. The outcome of this case is uncertain, as it represents uncharted territory for the Supreme Court. Regardless of the decision, it is likely to spark intense debate, as the issues at the heart of this case touch upon deeply-held beliefs and values. Whatever the justices decide, it will undoubtedly have significant implications for transgender students and their rights in schools across the United States.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Family of man shot dead by sheriff's deputy awarded $4 damages,"Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr's life was abruptly ended on a chilly winter evening in St Lucie County, Florida, on 14 January 2014. The 59-year-old man's only crime was answering the door to his garage in response to a noise complaint made by a sheriff's deputy. What transpired next would leave his family and community in shock and disbelief. According to police reports, Deputy First Class Osceola Bain II arrived at Hill's residence after receiving a call regarding a possible disturbance. As he approached the property, he claimed to have heard a loud bang coming from the garage. Fearing for his safety, Bain drew his gun and announced himself. Hill, who was inside the garage, allegedly failed to comply with the deputy's commands, leading to a tragic and fatal confrontation. Bain fired several shots through the garage door, striking Hill multiple times. The man was found unresponsive inside, with an unloaded gun nearby. The incident left Hill's loved ones in a state of grief and disbelief, wondering how such a tragic turn of events could have occurred. In the aftermath of Hill's death, the St Lucie County Sheriff's Office launched an internal investigation into the shooting. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also conducted a separate inquiry. Both investigations concluded that the deputy had acted within the bounds of the law. In the civil justice system, Hill's family had the opportunity to seek compensation for their losses. On 18 June 2015, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida awarded the Hill family a total of $4 in damages. This meagre sum was a stark contrast to the devastating impact of Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr's death. In the years following the shooting, Hill's family and friends continued to remember him as a loving husband, father, and friend. They held memorial services to honour his memory and shared stories of his kindness and generosity. Despite the seemingly insignificant damage award, the family's pursuit of justice served as a reminder of the importance of holding law enforcement officers accountable for their actions. The tragic shooting of Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and challenges of policing in modern society. It also underscores the importance of a fair and just legal system that can provide redress for the victims of police violence and their families. The legacy of Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr lives on, not just in the memories of his loved ones, but also in the ongoing dialogue about police accountability and community trust.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Concern over drivers using social media at the wheel,"By Ben Mundy, Newsbeat reporter The head of roads policing in England and Wales, Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, has expressed concern over the growing trend of drivers using social media while at the wheel. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, she highlighted the dangers of such behaviour and the potential legal consequences. ""People are increasingly posting updates, taking photos and video calling while driving,"" Chief Constable Davenport explained. ""But using your phone in this way is not only dangerous, it's against the law."" The use of handheld mobile phones while driving has been illegal in the UK since 2003. However, with the rise of social media platforms and hands-free technology, the issue has become more complex. ""Social media use while driving is a significant concern for us,"" Chief Constable Davenport continued. ""It's not just about making or receiving calls. Anything that takes your attention away from the road can put you and others at risk."" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has reported a rise in the number of drivers caught using their phones at the wheel. In 2018, some 22,000 drivers were issued with fixed penalty notices for using a handheld mobile phone. This figure represents a 14% increase compared to the previous year. ""We're seeing more and more cases of drivers using social media while driving,"" said Chief Constable Davenport. ""And it's not just young people. We're seeing drivers of all ages using their phones in this way."" The penalties for using a handheld mobile phone while driving include a fine of Â£200 and six penalty points on your licence. New drivers could also face having their licence revoked if they accrue six or more points within their first two years of driving. ""The risks are simply not worth it,"" Chief Constable Davenport urged. ""Not only could you be fined and lose your licence, but you could also cause a serious accident or even worse."" The RAC Foundation has called for harsher penalties for those caught using their phones while driving. The organisation's director, Steve Gooding, believes that the current penalties do not act as a strong enough deterrent. ""We need to see much tougher penalties for those who insist on using their mobile phones while driving,"" Gooding said. ""This behaviour is not only dangerous but it's also completely unnecessary. There's really no excuse for it."" Chief Constable Davenport agreed, stating that more needs to be done to raise awareness of the dangers of social media use while driving. ""We need to continue to educate drivers about the risks and the laws surrounding the use of mobile phones while driving,"" she said. ""But ultimately, it's up to each individual driver to make the right choice and keep their focus on the",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
West Coast Main Line bid probe 'must be external',"The decision to award the West Coast Main Line rail franchise to FirstGroup was scrapped just weeks after the announcement due to ""technical flaws"" in the bidding process. The government, led by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, has since announced a review of the process to determine what went wrong and ensure it doesn't happen again. However, the opposition Labour Party has called for an external investigation, arguing that the review may not be impartial. Labour's Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon stated, ""The government must not be allowed to whitewash what happened. There are serious concerns about the way this process was handled, and the public deserves answers. An external investigation is the only way to restore confidence in the bidding process and ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money."" The failure of the bidding process has caused significant disruption for passengers, with many facing uncertainty over the future of their trains. FirstGroup, the winning bidder, has been given a temporary extension to operate the franchise until a new winner can be found. However, this solution is only a stopgap, and long-term solutions are needed to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. The technical flaws that led to the scrapping of the bidding process are still unclear. Reports suggest that there may have been errors in the way bids were evaluated or scored. Some have speculated that political interference may have played a role, with the government favouring FirstGroup over other bidders. The West Coast Main Line is one of the most important rail routes in the country, connecting London with the north of England and Scotland. It is a crucial artery for both passengers and freight, and any disruption to the service can have far-reaching consequences. The rail industry has been under scrutiny in recent years, with concerns over privatisation leading to a call for reform. The bidding process for the West Coast Main Line franchise was seen as an opportunity to demonstrate that the system is functioning effectively and that the government is committed to delivering a reliable and efficient rail service. However, the scrapping of the process has only added to the criticism of the industry. Labour's Jim McMahon has called for a fundamental review of the rail sector, arguing that it is time for a new approach that puts passengers first. The government has promised to publish the findings of its review in due course. However, with calls for an external investigation growing louder, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to restore confidence in the bidding process and the rail industry as a whole. One thing is clear, though - the West Coast Main Line debacle has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in the way our rail services are awarded and operated.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Children need more exercise - especially girls, study says","By Nick Triggle, Health correspondent, BBC News University College London researchers found just 51% of the 6,500 children they monitored achieved the recommended hour of physical activity each day. This figure is lower for girls than boys, with only 45% of girls meeting the guideline compared with 57% of boys. The study, published in the International Journal of Obesity, used data from the Millennium Cohort Study, which has been following the health and development of children born in the UK between 2000 and 2002. The recommended hour of physical activity for children is equivalent to brisk walking for 60 minutes a day. The researchers say this level of activity is essential for good health, including maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk of chronic diseases later in life, and improving mental wellbeing. Girls are particularly at risk of not getting enough physical activity, according to the study. Researchers suggest this could be due to a number of factors, including social pressure to conform to certain body shapes and a lack of encouragement to take part in physical activities. The study also found that children from disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to meet the recommended physical activity levels. This is a trend that has been observed in many other studies and is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including a lack of safe outdoor spaces and limited opportunities to take part in organised sports. Dr Mark Pearson, lead author of the study, said: ""Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that girls are less physically active than boys, and that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less active than their more affluent peers. ""This is a concern because physical activity is important for so many aspects of children's health and development. We need to find ways to encourage more girls, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds, to be more active. This could include initiatives to provide safe outdoor spaces for play, making sports and physical activities more accessible, and encouraging schools to prioritise physical activity as part of the curriculum."" The study also highlights the importance of regular physical activity for boys. While they are more likely to meet the recommended hour, many boys still fall short, with only 57% achieving the target. The researchers say their findings underline the need for more action to encourage children to be more physically active. This could include initiatives to make sports and physical activities more accessible, as well as efforts to tackle the social pressures that can discourage girls from being active. Dr Pearson added: ""Physical activity is essential for good health, and it's worrying that so many children are not getting enough. We need to do more to encourage children to be more active, especially girls and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This will not only benefit their health now, but it could also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases later in life.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Italy coalition: Thousands rally in Rome against cuts,"Wielding red flags and placards, thousands of Italians took to the streets of Rome last night, urging the centre-left Prime Minister, Enrico Letta, to scrap austerity measures and focus on job creation. The demonstration, organized by Italy's main trade unions and left-wing parties, was the latest in a series of protests against the government's economic policies. Public trust in Letta's fragile coalition with the centre-right is dropping, according to the latest opinion polls. The coalition was formed in April 2013, following the collapse of the previous government, and is widely viewed as a stopgap measure to keep Italy's political instability at bay. However, its inability to address the country's economic woes has left many Italians feeling disillusioned. Letta's government has implemented a series of austerity measures, including tax hikes and spending cuts, in an effort to bring Italy's public debt under control. However, these measures have had a negative impact on the economy, leading to rising unemployment and widespread poverty. According to the latest figures, Italy's unemployment rate stands at 12.5%, the second highest in the European Union after Greece. The protesters last night demanded that the government invest in job creation and social services instead of implementing further austerity measures. They also called for an end to the privatization of state-owned companies and for the implementation of a minimum wage. Letta, who addressed the crowd from a balcony overlooking the Piazza del Popolo, acknowledged the concerns of the demonstrators but defended his government's economic policies. ""I understand your frustration, but we cannot ignore the reality of our public debt,"" Letta said. ""We have to make difficult decisions to ensure the future prosperity of our country. But we are also working to create jobs and invest in social services."" However, the protestors were not convinced. ""Letta and his government are only interested in pleasing the European Union and the international financial institutions,"" said Stefano Fusco, a member of the Italian Communist Party. ""They don't care about the suffering of ordinary Italians."" The protest, which lasted for several hours, passed off peacefully. However, there were reports of clashes between police and a small group of anarchists at the end of the demonstration. Letta's government is expected to present its 2015 budget to the European Commission next month. The budget is likely to include further austerity measures, leading to more protests and political instability in Italy.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Betsi health board chief criticises 'misleading' Tawel Fan claims,"It made major criticisms but found no evidence of institutional abuse at the now-closed Tawel Fan ward for dementia patients at Glan Clwyd Hospital. Some politicians and some families have labeled the report a ""whitewash"" and a ""cover-up,"" implying that the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) investigation into the ward was insufficient or biased. However, the chief executive of BCUHB, Dr. Gary Doherty, has strongly refuted these allegations, stating that the report was both thorough and accurate. In a press conference, Dr. Doherty emphasized that the report, which was conducted by an independent team of experts, was based on extensive evidence and interviews with staff, patients, and their families. He also noted that the report identified several areas for improvement within the ward, including staffing levels and training, and that the health board had already begun implementing these changes. Dr. Doherty further criticized the use of the terms ""whitewash"" and ""cover-up,"" stating that they were misleading and unfair. He explained that the investigation was not an attempt to hide or minimize any issues within the ward, but rather an opportunity to identify and address any concerns in a transparent and effective manner. The chief executive also acknowledged the significant emotional toll that the controversy had taken on the families of those affected by the care provided at Tawel Fan. He expressed his deep sympathy for their loss and frustration, and reiterated the health board's commitment to ensuring that all patients receive the highest possible standard of care. Despite these assurances, some critics have continued to express skepticism about the findings of the report and the impartiality of the investigation. They have called for an external review or inquiry to be conducted, and have demanded that those responsible for any wrongdoing be held accountable. Dr. Doherty acknowledged that the health board had made mistakes in the past, but emphasized that it was committed to learning from them and improving its services. He also encouraged anyone with concerns or information related to patient care at Glan Clwyd Hospital or any other BCUHB facility to come forward and share it with the health board. The controversy surrounding Tawel Fan ward is not over yet, but the outcome of the investigation and the response from the health board leadership provides some clarity and direction for those seeking answers and accountability. The focus now shifts to implementing the recommendations of the report and ensuring that the lessons learned are applied to improve patient care and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
TEDGlobal: Burns portrait comes alive at TED,"By Jane Wakefield, Technology reporter, TEDGlobal, Edinburgh The demonstration was part of a session at the TEDGlobal (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference dedicated to makers and DIY-ers. With a nod to the talking portraits at Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the stage was set for an intriguing presentation. Enter the team behind the Burns Anatomical Museum and Library in Dumfries, Scotland. They unveiled their latest project: a 3D-printed, interactive portrait of Robert Burns, the national poet of Scotland. The team, led by Dr. Alistair MacDonald, has spent years digitising the original 18th-century plaster cast of Burns' face held at the museum. The audience watched in awe as the team's projector illuminated the life-sized, 3D-printed portrait. Burns' eyes lit up, and his mouth moved, narrating a poem in a soft Scottish burr. The room filled with gasps and murmurs. The poetry recital was not just for show; Burns' voice was generated using text-to-speech technology, and the movement of his lips was all thanks to a cleverly designed system of hinges and motors. Dr. MacDonald explained that the team had used advanced facial recognition technology to capture the nuances of Burns' face. They then used this data to create a 3D model. The interactive portrait was made possible by integrating a projector, microphones, speakers, and an Arduino board. This innovative fusion of technology, history, and art left the TEDGlobal audience spellbound. By giving Burns a voice and a face that could move, the team had brought the iconic poet to life in a way that was both engaging and educational. The team's goal is to create a series of interactive portraits of important historical figures, providing a unique and captivating way to learn about their lives and stories. Dr. MacDonald shared that they are planning to create a Burns museum exhibit featuring this technology. As the session came to a close, the audience left the room buzzing with excitement. The team from Dumfries had not only delivered an impressive demonstration but also ignited the imagination of the TEDGlobal community. The future of interactive history was here, and it was more fascinating than anyone could have imagined. The TEDGlobal conference is known for its thought-provoking talks and innovative ideas. But the Burns portrait took things to a new level, combining technology, art, and history in a way that left the audience yearning for more.

France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe,"Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, Emmanuel Macron of France called for a historic reconstruction of Europe, emphasizing the need for deeper European Union integration. He was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with both leaders expressing a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to strengthen the bonds of the EU. Macron, the youngest French president in modern history, expressed his belief that the European project, which was born out of the ashes of World War II, has reached a critical juncture. He highlighted the challenges facing the continent, including terrorism, immigration, and economic instability, which he argued could only be addressed through closer cooperation. Merkel, who has been a staunch advocate of European unity throughout her political career, echoed Macron's sentiments. She acknowledged that the EU has faced ""difficulties and crises,"" but emphasized that these challenges should not be allowed to undermine the European project. Instead, she called for a renewed focus on unity and cooperation. Both leaders pledged to work together to deepen EU integration, with Macron emphasizing the need for a more integrated economic and monetary union. He also called for greater cooperation on defense and security, arguing that Europe must be able to defend itself in an increasingly uncertain world. Merkel, for her part, emphasized the importance of solidarity and social cohesion in the EU. She called for a renewed focus on education, job creation, and social welfare programs, arguing that these measures were essential for promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. Macron and Merkel also emphasized the need for greater democratic accountability and transparency in the EU. They called for greater citizen engagement in the EU decision-making process and for more open and transparent communication between EU institutions and European citizens. Despite the challenges facing the EU, both leaders expressed optimism about the future. Macron spoke of a ""new Europe,"" while Merkel emphasized the importance of ""building on the foundations of the past."" Together, they called for a renewed commitment to European unity and cooperation, arguing that the EU remains the best way to ensure peace, prosperity, and stability on the European continent. Their joint call for a historic reconstruction of Europe comes at a critical moment, as the EU faces a number of challenges, including Brexit, the refugee crisis, and economic instability. It remains to be seen whether their vision for a more integrated and united Europe will be realized, but one thing is clear: the need for European unity has never been greater.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Potholes cost councils Â£1,600 a day in compensation","In total, Â£584,745 was paid out last year to drivers by Glasgow City Council in compensation for damage caused by potholes. This startling figure represents an average of Â£1,600 per day, a cost that continues to escalate as the city's roads deteriorate. With the five-year total now passing the Â£2.7m mark, the issue of potholes in Glasgow has become a significant financial burden for the local authority. The council blames a combination of factors for the extensive damage to the city's roads, including extreme weather conditions, heavy traffic, and the aging infrastructure. Yet, despite these challenges, many residents and motorists feel that the council has not done enough to address the issue. In an effort to tackle the problem, Glasgow City Council announced a Â£10m investment in road repairs earlier this year. The funding will be used to patch up potholes, resurface roads, and carry out other essential maintenance work. However, some critics argue that the investment is not enough, given the scale of the problem and the ongoing costs of compensation. The consequences of potholes go beyond just financial costs. They can also pose a danger to road users, with the potential to cause accidents and vehicle damage. Moreover, they can have a negative impact on the overall appearance of a city, making it less attractive to visitors and businesses. Glasgow is not alone in its struggle with potholes. Across the UK, local authorities are facing increasing pressure to maintain their roads, with compensation claims continuing to rise. According to the Asphalt Industry Alliance, the total cost of pothole repairs in the UK is now estimated to be over Â£1bn a year. To put this into perspective, if Glasgow City Council were to dedicate just 1% of its annual budget to road maintenance, it could potentially prevent the need for compensation payments altogether. However, the council argues that it is already investing as much as it can in road repairs, and that more funding is needed from the Scottish Government to tackle the issue effectively. As the debate continues over who is responsible for fixing the UK's potholes and how to pay for it, one thing is clear: the costs of inaction are significant. For motorists, the damage to their vehicles can be inconvenient and expensive. For councils, the compensation payments can be a financial drain. And for the wider community, the impact on safety, appearance, and overall quality of life is a concern that should not be ignored. In the meantime, Glasgow City Council continues to work to repair the potholes as efficiently as possible, while also exploring new technologies and approaches to prevent the damage from occurring in the first place. Only time will tell whether these efforts will be enough to reduce the financial burden of potholes and improve the city's roads for all road users.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
China 'to survey disputed East China Sea islands',"State news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday that China had dispatched a survey vessel to the East China Sea to conduct studies on the disputed Diaoyu Islands, also known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan. The survey is said to be part of China's ""programme to safeguard its maritime rights and interests,"" according to Xinhua. The islands, located in the Pacific Ocean between Taiwan and Japan, have been a source of diplomatic tension between the two countries for decades. China claims sovereignty over the islands, while Japan maintains that they fall under its territorial control. The row over the islands, which are uninhabited but rich in natural resources such as oil and gas, escalated in 2012 when Japan nationalized some of them, prompting protests in China and a diplomatic spat between the two nations. The latest survey comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with both China and Japan increasing their military presence in the area in recent months. In August, China sent a fleet of 14 warships into the waters around the islands, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets in response. China's move to survey the islands is likely to be met with criticism from Japan, which has repeatedly warned against any unilateral actions that could escalate tensions in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said last week that his country would ""take firm action"" if China took any steps to change the status quo in the East China Sea. Despite the ongoing dispute, there have been signs of improved relations between China and Japan in recent months. In October, the two countries agreed to a record-breaking trade deal worth $250 billion over the next five years. However, the issue of the disputed islands remains a major sticking point in their relationship. The survey vessel, identified as the Chinese research vessel Haixun 01, set sail from the port of Xiamen in Fujian Province on Monday and is expected to arrive at the disputed islands on Wednesday, according to Chinese state media. The vessel is equipped with advanced survey equipment and is capable of conducting seabed surveys, according to Xinhua. China's move to conduct the survey comes as it continues to assert its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where it has built artificial islands and installed military installations. The United States and other regional powers have criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying its neighbors and threatening freedom of navigation in the region. Despite the ongoing tensions, there are still hopes for a peaceful resolution to the dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Both China and Japan have signaled their willingness to engage in diplomatic talks to find a peaceful solution to the issue. However, until a mutually acceptable resolution is reached, the dispute is likely to remain a",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
First peek at Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play,"By Amelia Butterly, Newsbeat reporter Published on Pottermore, JK Rowling's Harry Potter website, the images show a young boy in a nest of blankets, cradled by two figures. The boy, with bright red hair and glasses, looks up curiously at the camera, a look of wonder in his eyes. The images mark the first official peek at the highly anticipated stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The production, which is set to open in London's West End in June, promises to continue the story of Harry Potter and his family. The images also reveal the identities of the two figures holding the young boy. They are, in fact, Harry Potter and his older son, James Sirius Potter. This marks the first official recognition of Harry as a father, a role he took on with his wife Ginny Weasley after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Fans of the Harry Potter series have been eagerly awaiting any news about the play, which was first announced in 2015. The images, which were released alongside a brief synopsis of the play, have sent the Harry Potter community into a frenzy. The synopsis reveals that the play will follow Harry, now a husband and father of three, as he grapples with a ""deep rooted truth"" about his past. It also introduces a new character, Albus Potter, Harry's middle child, who will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The images and synopsis have sparked a flurry of theories and speculation among fans. Some have suggested that Albus may struggle with the weight of his famous family name, or that he may be dealing with a bullying problem at Hogwarts. Others have noted the potential significance of the red hair and glasses, which are traits shared by both Harry and Albus. The release of the images and synopsis has also generated excitement for the upcoming production, which has already sold out its initial run. Ticket resales on websites like StubHub and Viagogo are currently going for upwards of Â£1,000. Fans who are unable to attend the London production will have the opportunity to experience the story in other ways. A special rehearsal edition script of the play will be released in July, and an audiobook adaptation is scheduled for later in the year. As the world eagerly waits for the opening of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, one thing is certain: J.K. Rowling's magical universe continues to captivate and inspire fans of all ages.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Scrap ban' on term-time holidays,"By Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter Since September last year, local authorities have been obliged to fine parents who take children out of school for unauthorised absences. But the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales, is calling for an end to this policy, known as the ""scrap ban on term-time holidays."" The LGA argues that the current rules are overly restrictive and are causing undue stress for many families. The association's children and young people board chairman, Cllr Anntis Flood, said: ""It's important to remember that no parent wants to miss their child's education, but sometimes a family holiday can't be arranged outside term time due to work and financial commitments."" Cllr Flood added that councils are facing a growing backlog of fines for unauthorised absences, with some local authorities issuing hundreds of penalties each month. The fines, which can reach up to Â£2,500 per parent per child, can have a significant impact on families already struggling with the cost of living. The LGA's call for a review of the current rules comes as new research suggests that missing a few days of school can have a negative impact on a child's academic progress. The study, by the University of East Anglia, found that pupils who were absent for more than 10% of the school year were more likely to fall behind their peers. However, the LGA argues that the current rules are not helping to reduce absence levels. Instead, they are leading to an increase in unauthorised absences, as parents feel they have no other option but to take their children out of school during term time. The association is calling on the government to review the current rules and consider introducing more flexible approaches to managing absence, such as allowing parents to apply for term-time holidays in exceptional circumstances. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We do not expect parents to take their children on holiday during term time. Regular attendance at school is essential for a child's education and future prospects. Local authorities have the power to fine parents if they take their children out of school without permission."" However, some schools and local authorities are already taking a more flexible approach to attendance. For example, some are allowing parents to take their children out of school for a day or two at a time, as long as they make up the missed work. The LGA's call for a review of the current rules is supported by a number of education and child welfare organisations, including the National Association of Head Teachers and the Children's Commissioner for England. The issue of term-time holidays is likely to continue to be a contentious one, with some arguing that children's education should be a priority, while others believe that families should be allowed some flexibility to take a break when it suits",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Wife 'stunned' by wedding ring find,"Paul Higson had been scared to tell his wife Jan he had lost the ring. The precious gold band, a constant reminder of their love and commitment, was nowhere to be found. He had misplaced it during one of his many trips working across the Orkney mainland. The pair had been married for ten years, and the ring had been a cherished gift from Jan on their wedding day. Paul knew how much the ring meant to her, and the thought of having to break the news of its loss weighed heavily on him. Two months passed, and the longer Paul went without telling Jan, the more anxious he became. He kept replaying the possible scenarios in his mind, imagining the worst-case scenarios of how she might react. Each day that passed only added to his guilt, but he couldn't bring himself to confess. One day, as Paul returned home from a long week of work, he found Jan in the kitchen, her hands busy with the evening meal. She looked up as he entered, her expression inscrutable. Paul braced himself, knowing that the moment of truth was at hand. ""Jan, there's something I need to tell you,"" he began, his voice trembling slightly. ""I've lost the ring. I've been looking for it everywhere, but I just can't find it."" Jan's face fell, and Paul's heart sank as he saw the tears well up in her eyes. ""Paul, why didn't you tell me sooner? I've been so worried. What if something had happened to you?"" Paul felt a pang of guilt at her words. He had been so focused on his own fears that he had forgotten how much the ring meant to Jan. ""I'm so sorry, Jan. I didn't mean to worry you. I was just so scared of how you might react."" Jan took a deep breath, trying to keep her emotions in check. ""It's okay, Paul. I understand that you were worried, but I need you to be honest with me in the future. We'll replace the ring, and it will be as good as new."" Paul nodded, relieved that the conversation had gone as well as it could have. ""I'll start looking for a new ring right away. I want to make it up to you."" Jan smiled, her expression softening. ""I know you will, Paul. I love you and trust you, and I know that this was an honest mistake."" Paul felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he realized that Jan's love for him was stronger than his fear of her reaction. He knew that they would get through this together, and he vowed to be more open and honest with her in the future. As they sat down to dinner that evening, Paul couldn't help but feel grateful for the love and understanding that Jan had shown him.

Commons could close early due to coronavirus,"Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House of Commons, has announced that the option of closing the House of Commons early due to the coronavirus outbreak is being considered. However, he emphasized that emergency legislation needs to be approved before any definitive decision can be made. MPs are bracing themselves for a number of changes to the way the House of Commons runs in the coming weeks. The government is exploring various measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of parliamentarians amidst the ongoing health crisis. One of the most significant changes could be the curtailment of sitting hours. With the number of COVID-19 cases on the rise, there are growing concerns about the risk of transmission within the parliamentary estate. Closing the Commons early could help minimize contact between MPs and reduce the likelihood of an outbreak. Another possibility is increasing the use of virtual proceedings. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently recommended that the House of Commons implement a hybrid model of virtual and physical sittings. This would allow MPs to participate remotely, reducing the number of people present in the chamber at any given time. The government is also considering implementing new measures to maintain social distancing within the chamber. This could include reducing the number of seats available, installing Perspex screens, and rearranging the seating layout. Despite these measures, some MPs have expressed reservations about the proposed changes. They argue that the Commons must continue to function as normally as possible, in order to hold the government to account and represent the interests of their constituents. However, others believe that the health and safety of MPs and parliamentary staff must be the top priority. They argue that the Commons must adapt to the new reality of the pandemic, and find ways to carry out its crucial functions while minimizing the risk of transmission. The government is expected to make a definitive decision on the matter in the coming days. In the meantime, MPs are continuing to work remotely, using video conferencing technology to hold virtual surgeries and engage with their constituents. The situation is evolving rapidly, and it remains to be seen what the final outcome will be. But one thing is clear: the House of Commons will look very different in the coming months, as it adapts to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
VW US sales rise despite scandal,"On Monday, US regulators announced that an additional 800,000 Volkswagen (VW) vehicles were found to be equipped with devices that concealed emission levels during testing, bringing the total number of affected cars to around 11 million worldwide. Despite this ongoing scandal, VW managed to sell 30,387 cars in the United States during October, marking a slight increase of 0.24% compared to the same month last year. The sales figure represents a small victory for the German automaker, which has been grappling with the fallout from the emissions cheating scandal since it was first exposed in September 2015. The company has faced numerous lawsuits, regulatory fines, and a significant loss of consumer trust as a result of the scandal. However, VW's US sales have shown signs of resilience in recent months. In September, the company reported a 1.3% increase in sales compared to the same month in 2015, driven in part by strong demand for its SUV models. October's sales figure suggests that this trend may continue, despite the ongoing scandal. ""We are very encouraged by the continued strong demand for Volkswagen products in the US market,"" said Hinrich Woebcken, the CEO of VW's North American region, in a statement. ""Our customers in the US have shown their confidence in our brand and we are committed to earning their trust back every day."" Industry analysts attribute VW's ability to maintain sales in the US to several factors. First, the company has been offering incentives and discounts to attract buyers. Second, the US market is larger and more diverse than many other markets, with a greater appetite for SUVs and other larger vehicles. Finally, VW has been working to address the emissions scandal and make things right with affected customers. Despite these positives, VW still faces significant challenges in the wake of the scandal. The company is currently in the process of negotiating a settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which could cost billions of dollars. Additionally, the company is still working to recall and fix the affected vehicles, a process that is expected to take several years. In the meantime, VW will continue to focus on regaining consumer trust and maintaining sales momentum in the US market. The company is investing in new models, such as the ID. electric car, and is working to improve its quality and transparency. Only time will tell if these efforts will be enough to put the emissions scandal behind the company and restore its reputation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Women still do more household chores than men, ONS finds","The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released a report revealing a persistent imbalance in household chores between men and women. According to the study, when it came to unpaid chores at home, women were doing almost 40% more than men on average. Men averaged 16 hours a week helping out, whereas women clocked in at 22 hours. This disparity is not a new finding, yet it remains a pressing issue that continues to perpetuate gender inequality within households. The report, which was based on data from the ONS's Time Use Survey, examined the amount of time spent on various household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, laundry, and childcare. The findings are in line with previous studies that have highlighted the unequal distribution of domestic labour. For instance, a 2018 report by the OECD revealed that women in the UK spend more time on unpaid work than men in all but three European countries. The consequences of this disparity can be far-reaching. Women, who often bear the brunt of household chores, may experience increased stress levels and reduced time for pursuing careers or personal interests. Men, on the other hand, may reap the benefits of having more free time for work or leisure activities. The report also pointed out that the gap in household chores was more pronounced in households with children. Women in these households spent an average of 25 hours a week on unpaid work, compared to 15 hours for men. The ONS report comes at a time when the issue of gender inequality in the home has gained increasing attention. In recent years, there have been calls for a change in societal attitudes towards domestic work and a redistribution of household chores. Some experts have suggested that one way to address this issue is through policy interventions. For instance, affordable childcare and flexible working arrangements could help to reduce the burden on women. Others have advocated for a cultural shift in attitudes towards domestic work, encouraging men to take on a more equal share of household chores. Despite progress in other areas of gender equality, it is clear that there is still work to be done when it comes to the division of household labour. The ONS report serves as a reminder that women continue to do more unpaid work at home, and that this disparity can have significant consequences for gender equality and women's empowerment. It is crucial that we continue to challenge and address these gender stereotypes and work towards a more equal distribution of household chores.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Ex-soldier self-isolating on 'uninhabited' Hildasay,"Chris Lewis, the ex-soldier who has walked over 12,000 miles since setting off from near his home in Swansea in August 2017, has now been given special permission to self-isolate on the uninhabited island of Hildasay, off the coast of Scotland. The island, which is part of the Orkney archipelago, is known for its rugged terrain, abundant wildlife, and isolation. It was the perfect place for Chris, who has been on a mission to walk around the coast of mainland Britain, to take a break from the world as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread. ""I was feeling a bit cooped up in my tent, and I knew I needed to get away from it all,"" Chris said in a statement. ""I've been on the road for almost three years now, and while I love the journey, it's nice to have a change of scenery."" Chris, who served in the British Army for 13 years before setting off on his walking adventure, had been planning to reach the Scottish border by the end of the year. But with the ongoing pandemic, he knew it would be difficult to continue his journey without putting himself or others at risk. ""I've been following the news closely, and I know that the virus is still spreading,"" Chris said. ""I don't want to be a risk to anyone, so I decided to take advantage of this opportunity to self-isolate on Hildasay."" The Scottish government, which has been praised for its handling of the pandemic, granted Chris permission to stay on the island for an indefinite period. He will be the only person on the island during his stay, and he will be required to follow strict guidelines to ensure his safety and the safety of others. ""I'm looking forward to the peace and quiet of the island,"" Chris said. ""I plan to spend my time exploring the island, writing, and reflecting on my journey so far. I'm also looking forward to catching up on some much-needed rest."" Chris's walking adventure has captured the imagination of people across the UK and beyond. He has documented his journey on social media, sharing stunning photographs and stories of the places he's visited. His story has been a source of inspiration for many, and his determination to continue his journey despite the challenges he's faced has been an source of admiration for many.

Putin's Stasi spy ID pass found in Germany,"The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass, an intriguing relic of his past, was recently discovered during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi, the secret police forces of the Soviet Union and East Germany respectively. The find, made by German historians, has stirred up renewed interest in Putin's past and the nature of his relationship with the former East German intelligence agency. The Stasi pass, bearing Putin's name and the code name 'Feliks' - a name Putin has used intermittently throughout his political career - is a tangible link to a time when the future Russian leader was an active intelligence agent. According to the historians, Putin's Stasi file is also believed to have been uncovered. The contents of the file have not been made public, but it is said to contain details of his missions and interactions with the East German security services. These revelations have fuelled speculation about the extent of Putin's involvement with the Stasi and the implications for his current role as Russia's president. Putin's time in Dresden, East Germany, is a well-documented period in his career. He arrived in the city in 1985, working as a KGB officer at the local consulate. During his time in Dresden, Putin is known to have liaised with Stasi officers, conducting joint intelligence operations. This co-operation was not uncommon during the Cold War, with the KGB and Stasi sharing information and resources in their efforts to counteract Western influences. Despite the revelation of his Stasi pass, Putin has remained defiant, insisting that his past work for the KGB and Stasi has no bearing on his current position as president. In a statement, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed the find as ""nonsensical"", saying that ""Putin's past service in the KGB is a matter of public record and does not impact his current role as president."" However, for many, the discovery of Putin's Stasi pass raises questions about the transparency of his past and the implications for his current leadership. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 brought about a new era of openness and accountability, but Putin's past as a KGB officer and his close ties to the intelligence community continue to cast a long shadow over his presidency. The find also serves as a reminder of the complex web of alliances and collaborations that existed during the Cold War. It highlights the need for continued research into the actions of intelligence agencies during this period and the importance of transparency in the actions of modern-day leaders.

Trump tariffs: President says EU makes business 'impossible',"Defending his tariff plans as he hosted the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr. Trump at the White House, the American president reiterated his stance on international trade, accusing European countries of making business ""impossible"" for American companies. He asserted, ""Other countries have taken advantage of the United States for decades, but those days are over."" Mr. Trump's remarks came in response to questions regarding his recent decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which has sparked a global trade dispute. He argued that the tariffs were essential to protect American industries and jobs, stating, ""We cannot let our country be taken advantage of any longer. We're not going to let it happen."" The President went on to criticize the European Union's (EU) trade practices, accusing the bloc of imposing significant tariffs on American products, while allowing European exports to enter the US market with little or no restrictions. ""The European Union is brutal to the United States,"" he said, adding, ""They put large tariffs on our products. We put very small tariffs on their products."" Mr. Trump's comments echoed his previous statements on the issue, in which he claimed that the US had been treated unfairly in international trade deals. He has long argued that the US has been ""ripped off"" by other countries, particularly those in Europe and Asia. The Swedish Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, who was in Washington to discuss trade and security issues, tried to downplay the tensions between the US and the EU. He emphasized the importance of transatlantic cooperation, stating, ""We have to work together to find solutions and to find a common ground."" Despite Mr. LÃ¶fven's efforts to ease tensions, Mr. Trump remained firm in his position, insisting that the US would no longer be a ""pushover"" in international trade negotiations. ""The United States is not going to be taken advantage of anymore,"" he said, adding, ""We want free, fair, and reciprocal trade."" The President's comments came as the EU prepares to retaliate against the US tariffs with its own measures, which could potentially spark a full-blown trade war between the world's two largest economies. However, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that a resolution could be reached, stating, ""I believe that we'll make a deal with the European Union. I believe that we'll make a fair deal for both parties."" Despite the uncertainty surrounding the future of transatlantic trade relations, Mr. Trump remained focused on his goal of protecting American industries and jobs, insisting that the US would no longer be a ""patsy"" in international trade deals. Whether this approach will ultimately lead to a more balanced and equitable global trading system, or spark a damaging trade war, remains to be seen.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sir Terry Matthews: Wales lacks IT commerce skills,"The industrialist, who made his fortune in hi-tech firms, is to address a conference in Newport, South Wales, on how businesses can use IT to boost profits. He spoke passionately about the importance of IT in today's business world and the need for Welsh companies to invest in this area. ""We in Wales have a lot of catching up to do,"" Sir Terry Matthews, the founder of Newport's SAGE Group and the investment firm, Pentech Ventures, told the conference attendees. ""Too many businesses here lack the IT skills and knowledge necessary to compete in a global marketplace."" Sir Terry's comments come at a time when Wales is trying to reposition itself as a hub for tech businesses. The Welsh Government has launched several initiatives to attract tech companies and start-ups to the region, including the establishment of a Â£1 billion tech enterprise zone in Newport. However, Sir Terry believes that more needs to be done to develop the IT skills of the workforce. ""It's all well and good having the infrastructure in place, but if you don't have the people with the skills to use it, then you're not going to be competitive,"" he said. Sir Terry urged businesses to invest in training their staff in IT skills, such as coding, data analysis, and cybersecurity. He also called on schools and universities to do more to prepare students for the tech industry. ""We need to start teaching IT skills from a young age,"" he said. ""We can't afford to leave it until people are in the workforce and then try to play catch-up. We need to be proactive and make sure that the next generation of workers is IT-literate."" Sir Terry's comments were met with agreement from many in the business community. John Davies, the CEO of the South Wales Chamber of Commerce, said that the lack of IT skills was a major barrier to growth for many businesses in the region. ""We hear time and again from businesses that they struggle to find people with the right IT skills,"" he said. ""It's holding them back from expanding and competing on a global scale."" The Welsh Government has acknowledged the issue and has announced plans to invest Â£20 million in IT training for the workforce over the next three years. The government also plans to establish a new IT skills academy in Cardiff to provide training for young people and adults. However, some have expressed doubt that these measures will be enough to address the issue fully. Sir Terry called on businesses and education providers to work together to develop a comprehensive IT skills strategy for Wales. ""We need to work together to make sure that we're producing a workforce that's fit for the future,"" he said.

"Wales council mergers: Cost could be Â£200m, says WLGA","The Williams Commission, established in 2018 to examine the future of local government in Wales, proposed merging local authorities to reduce the current number from 22 to between 10 and 12. This recommendation has sparked a significant debate, with potential implications for both the public purse and the delivery of local services. WLGA (Welsh Local Government Association) chief executive Steve Thomas addressed the issue recently, stating, ""There is no magic wand to make these mergers happen without cost."" He continued, ""The estimated cost could be in the region of Â£200m."" Thomas emphasized the need for a thorough and transparent process when it comes to implementing these mergers. He acknowledged that the potential savings cannot be achieved overnight and that the transition would require substantial financial investment. The proposed mergers could lead to potential economies of scale, such as shared services, reduced bureaucracy, and increased efficiency. However, these benefits may be offset by the initial costs of the mergers themselves. Thomas explained, ""The merger process will involve significant costs, including the hiring of consultants, legal fees, and the establishment of new structures and systems."" He added, ""These costs, coupled with the potential disruption to services during the transition period, could prove challenging for local authorities."" Despite the financial challenges, Thomas remains optimistic about the potential benefits of the mergers. He believes that by working together, local authorities can improve the delivery of services and create a more streamlined local government structure. Thomas also emphasized the importance of addressing the concerns and challenges of local communities during the merger process to ensure a smooth transition. The Welsh Government has yet to respond to the Williams Commission's recommendations, and the future of local government in Wales remains uncertain. However, the estimated cost of Â£200m serves as a reminder of the significant financial investment required to achieve the proposed mergers. Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the merger process will require careful consideration, extensive planning, and robust financial management to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs. As the debate continues, it is crucial that all stakeholders, including local authorities, the Welsh Government, and the public, are engaged in the conversation to ensure a positive outcome for all.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Rory Cowan: 'Unhappy' Mrs Brown's Boys actor quits,"Cowan, who has played Buster Brady in the hit BBC One sitcom since its inception in 2011, made the announcement following a performance of Mrs Brown's Boys at London's O2 Arena on Sunday. The news came as a shock to both the cast and crew, as well as the thousands of fans in attendance. In a statement issued through his publicist, Cowan explained his decision, saying, ""I have spent over ten years working on Mrs Brown's Boys and I believe that it is the right time for me to leave. I have been unhappy for a while and I feel that it is time for me to move on."" The actor's departure comes just weeks after the sitcom's creator and star, Brendan O'Carroll, announced that the show would be moving from the BBC to ITV in 2022. Cowan's departure is not believed to be related to the move, but rather a personal decision. O'Carroll, who plays Agnes Brown in the show, took to social media to express his sadness at Cowan's departure. ""I am heartbroken that Rory has decided to leave Mrs Brown's Boys. He is a brilliant actor and a dear friend. I will miss him terribly, but I understand and support his decision. We will all miss Buster Brady."" Fans of the show have taken to social media to express their disappointment and sadness at Cowan's departure. Many have praised his performances and expressed their hope that he will return to the show in the future. Cowan's departure comes at a difficult time for the show, which has been hit by a series of high-profile departures in recent years. In addition to Cowan, actor Gary Hollywood, who played Dino Doyle, left the show in 2019, and actor Dermot O'Neill, who played Martin Brown, left in 2020. Despite the departures, Mrs Brown's Boys remains a popular and successful show, both in the UK and internationally. The sitcom has won numerous awards, including the National Television Award for Best Comedy four times, and has been sold to over 100 territories around the world. It is not yet clear what Cowan's future plans are, but he is expected to continue working in the entertainment industry. In the meantime, fans of Mrs Brown's Boys will have to wait and see how the show deals with Buster Brady's absence when it returns to our screens in the new year.

John Boehner survives House rebellion in US Congress,"Mr. Boehner survived a challenging week in the US Congress, fending off a rebellion from the Republican Party's more conservative wing. With 25 Republicans voting against him in a closed-door meeting, the speaker's future seemed uncertain. However, Boehner's strong leadership and political savvy allowed him to emerge victorious, for now. At the top of the Republican agenda is repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Boehner has long been a vocal critic of the healthcare law, and the GOP caucus is united in its opposition. The strategic use of the budget reconciliation process, which only requires a simple majority in the Senate, offers a glimmer of hope to Republicans seeking to overturn the law. Another major priority for the Republicans is addressing the national debt and reducing federal spending. The party's freshman class, known as the Tea Party, has made cutting government waste and eliminating unnecessary programs a central tenet of their platform. Boehner has promised to work with this faction to find areas where savings can be realized, but he will also need to balance the demands of his more moderate members. Immediate action is required to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, where tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have crossed into the United States in recent months. The situation has put pressure on Boehner to take decisive action, and he has indicated that a legislative response is forthcoming. However, the issue is complex, and finding a bipartisan solution will not be easy. In the coming weeks, Boehner will also face challenges related to the broader budget process and the upcoming debt ceiling deadline. The speaker has already indicated that he will pursue a short-term extension of the debt limit to give lawmakers time to negotiate a long-term solution. However, this approach could lead to another high-stakes showdown between the parties, with potentially dangerous consequences for the economy. Despite the challenges, Boehner remains confident that he can navigate the tumultuous political waters of the US Congress.

Mayor hopes Treasury will hop on board travel plans,"Tom Edwards, Transport Correspondent, London @BBCTomEdwards Today the mayor was in Northern Ireland, showcasing the new chassis production line for the much-anticipated new trains for the Crossrail project. The Â£15 billion scheme, also known as the Elizabeth line, is set to revolutionize London's transport network when it opens in 2022. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, expressed his delight at the progress made on the project, stating, ""This is a major milestone in the delivery of the Elizabeth line, and I'm thrilled to see the new trains taking shape."" He continued, ""This state-of-the-art production line is a testament to the skills and dedication of the workforce here in Northern Ireland, and I'm grateful for their hard work."" However, the mayor's visit was not just an opportunity to celebrate the project's progress. He used the occasion to press the government on the need for further funding to ensure the Elizabeth line's long-term success. Khan revealed that the project still requires an additional Â£2.5 billion from the Treasury to complete the necessary infrastructure works and to purchase the remaining 20 trains. ""We need the government to get on board and invest in the remaining infrastructure works and the purchase of the final 20 trains,"" Khan said. ""The Elizabeth line is essential for London's transport network, and it will bring significant economic benefits to the city and the country as a whole."" The mayor's call for additional funding comes as the government faces increasing pressure to invest in public transport infrastructure. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and efficient transport systems, and the Crossrail project is seen as a key component in London's recovery. The Treasury has announced that it will consider the mayor's request as part of its annual budget process. A spokesperson for the Treasury said, ""We have already invested over Â£8 billion in the Crossrail project, and we are committed to delivering a world-class transport system for Londoners. We will consider the mayor's request as part of our budget deliberations."" Despite the uncertainty surrounding the funding, the mayor remained optimistic about the project's future. ""I'm confident that the Elizabeth line will be a success, and I'm determined to see it through,"" he said. ""Londoners deserve a transport system that is fit for the 21st century, and I won't rest until we deliver it."" As the mayor left Northern Ireland, he was greeted with the sight of the new trains taking shape on the production line. It was a reminder of the progress that had been made and the exciting future that lay ahead for the Elizabeth line. The challenge now was to ensure that the project received the necessary funding to complete the job. Only then could Londoners truly reap the benefits of this transformative transport project.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, 'not caused by the XMRV virus', say researchers","By Helen Briggs, Health reporter, BBC News US scientists made headlines in 2009 when they linked chronic fatigue syndrome (ME) to a mouse-like virus. But new research from the UK suggests this discovery was a ""false positive."" A team from the University of Edinburgh and University College London analyzed blood samples from ME patients and healthy controls, taken before the 2009 study. They found no evidence of the XMRV virus in any of the samples. ""There's now good reason to believe that XMRV does not cause ME,"" said Dr Jonathan Stoye from the Francis Crick Institute, who led the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. The 2009 study, conducted by US researchers at the Whittemore Peterson Institute, caused a stir when it claimed to have found the first definite cause of ME. The team reported that the virus was present in 67% of ME patients' blood samples, compared with just 3.7% of the control group. But doubts about the findings began to emerge soon after. Other research groups failed to replicate the results, and some studies even suggested the virus might not exist in humans at all. The new UK study, which analyzed samples from the same cohort of patients used in the 2009 research, provides further evidence that the XMRV link was a mistake. The researchers used a more sensitive testing method than the one used in the original study. They also looked for other viruses that could have been mistaken for XMRV, and found no evidence of any virus in the ME patients' samples. ""We think it's unlikely that XMRV is involved in ME at all,"" said Dr Ian Lipkin from Columbia University, who was not involved in the study but has worked on ME research. ""This study provides strong evidence against the XMRV hypothesis, which has been a major focus of research in ME for over a decade,"" he told the Science Media Centre. The findings do not mean that ME, which affects an estimated 250,000 people in the UK, has no cause. The cause remains unknown, despite extensive research. ""It's an important reminder that research findings need to be carefully evaluated and replicated before they are accepted as fact,"" said Dr Stoye. ""We need to keep looking for the cause of ME, and this study should not discourage researchers from continuing their work,"" he added. The ME Association, a UK charity for people affected by the condition, said the study was ""another blow to the hope that ME might be caused by a single virus."" ""We remain hopeful that the cause of ME will be found and that, eventually, effective treatments and a cure will be developed,"" the charity said in a statement.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Netflix removes Dave Chappelle's show after comedian's complaint,"Chappelle's Show first aired on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2006, bringing laughter and controversy in equal measure. The groundbreaking sketch comedy series, which featured Dave Chappelle playing various characters and tackling taboo subjects, quickly gained a large and dedicated fanbase. But in an excerpt from a recent stand-up gig that he posted on Instagram, Chappelle claimed that he ""never got paid"" royalties after the show's production ended. This revelation came as a shock to many, given Chappelle's reported net worth of over $50 million. However, the comedian argued that his lack of financial involvement in the show's streaming rights was a result of a poorly negotiated deal. ""I've been watching people watching my old TV show. I didn't get paid a dime for that,"" he said during the stand-up performance. ""I didn't get paid for that, and I'm the one who wrote it, I'm the one who acted in it. I'm the one who came up with the fucking ideas."" The controversy surrounding Chappelle's financial situation with Comedy Central and Netflix, which currently streams Chappelle's Show, came to a head last week when the streaming giant removed the show from its platform. In a statement to Variety, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed that ""we have decided with Comedy Central to remove the show from Netflix, because we want to honor and respect Dave Chappelle's decision to exercise creative control and ownership of his work."" However, some have criticized Netflix for bowing to pressure from Chappelle and his team, rather than standing by their commitment to stream content that may be controversial or offensive. ""Netflix is once again caving to the demands of a privileged, wealthy, and powerful man, rather than standing up for its commitment to providing its customers with a diverse range of content,"" said a spokesperson for the National Coalition Against Censorship. Despite the controversy, Chappelle has remained defiant, insisting that he is not trying to censor his own work, but rather seeking financial compensation for his contributions to the show. ""I'm not asking for much, I'm just asking for what I rightfully earned,"" he said during a recent interview. ""I'm not trying to censor anything. I'm just trying to get paid for it."" The situation raises important questions about the role of streaming platforms in the entertainment industry and the rights of creators to control and profit from their work. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: Dave Chappelle's influence on comedy and popular culture is undeniable, and his legacy will continue to shape the industry for years to come.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Boris Johnson: Intelligence questions raise trust issue again,"Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurakenssign; Political editor, BBC. The questions that many of his colleagues aren't quite sure about. And of course, the question that the front-runner to become prime minister in a few weeks answers heartily, yes, he does have a proven track record of intellectual brilliance. Boris Johnson's critics, however, remain unconvinced. Intelligence and competence are once again at the forefront of debates surrounding Johnson's leadership capabilities. Johnson's opponents argue that his actions throughout his political career have raised serious concerns regarding his decision-making skills and intelligence. From his infamous lying under a tree during the 1994 European Parliament election campaign to his ill-fated tenure as London Mayor, Johnson's critics claim that he has consistently failed to demonstrate the required intellectual rigor for the top job in British politics. The latest controversy involves Johnson's comments on the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May. Johnson's critics argue that his dismissive attitude towards the deal and his refusal to provide detailed explanations for his opposition to it indicates a lack of intellectual depth. According to some, Johnson's attacks on the deal are driven more by political motives than by a genuine understanding of the complexities of the Brexit negotiations. Moreover, Johnson's past gaffes and blunders have fueled doubts about his intellectual prowess. From his infamous claim that he ""learned to read"" while riding the London Underground to his recent comment about ""turkey twizzlers"" being a type of sausage, Johnson's critics argue that his careless comments and misunderstandings of complex issues indicate a lack of intellectual rigor. Despite these concerns, Johnson and his supporters argue that his intelligence is not the only factor that matters in politics. They point to his ability to connect with voters, his charisma, and his proven track record of delivering results. Johnson's supporters argue that his intellectual abilities are not the only measure of his worth as a potential prime minister. However, the questions surrounding Johnson's intelligence and competence are unlikely to go away anytime soon. As the race to become prime minister heats up, Johnson's opponents will continue to challenge him on these issues. And Johnson will need to provide clear and convincing answers if he wants to put these doubts to rest once and for all. In the end, it is up to the British people to decide whether Johnson's intellectual abilities are enough to make him an effective prime minister. But the ongoing debate about Johnson's intelligence is a reminder that competence and intellectual ability are important qualities for any political leader, and that voters have a right to demand answers from their candidates. In conclusion, Boris Johnson's intelligence is once again under scrutiny as he gears up to become the next prime minister of Britain.

"Man's surgery wait death 'avoidable', says ombudsman","Gareth Lewis Jones, a 37-year-old man from Neath Port Talbot, was eagerly anticipating his upcoming surgery to address his adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). The condition, which he had lived with since birth, had progressed to a critical stage, and the operation was considered the best chance for him to live a longer and healthier life. However, just weeks before the scheduled procedure, Mr. Jones tragically passed away. His family was devastated by the sudden turn of events and were left questioning whether his death could have been prevented. Following an investigation by the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, it was determined that there were indeed failings in the care provided to Mr. Jones, which may have contributed to his death. The inquiry revealed that there had been a delay in arranging the necessary pre-operative tests, which could have shed light on the severity of Mr. Jones' condition and potentially led to earlier intervention. Furthermore, there were communication issues between the various healthcare professionals involved in his care, resulting in inconsistencies in the treatment plan. The Ombudsman's report also highlighted that there were inadequacies in the way that Mr. Jones' case was managed within the healthcare system. The lack of clear and effective communication between the different healthcare teams involved in his care, as well as inadequate record keeping, contributed to a fragmented and disjointed approach to his treatment. The findings of the investigation sparked outrage among Mr. Jones' family and advocacy groups, who called for improvements in the way that adult congenital heart disease is diagnosed and managed in Wales. The Welsh Government responded by announcing a review of the services provided for ACHD patients, with a focus on improving communication and coordination between healthcare teams and ensuring that patients receive timely access to appropriate care. The case of Gareth Lewis Jones serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of effective communication and coordinated care in the healthcare system. It also highlights the need for continuous improvement and investment in services for adults with congenital heart disease, to ensure that they receive the best possible care and have the best chance of living healthy and fulfilling lives. Although the investigation provided some answers for Mr. Jones' family, they were left with a deep sense of loss and regret. They hoped that the recommendations from the Ombudsman's report would lead to meaningful change, so that no other family would have to endure the same pain and heartache that they had experienced.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Le Patourel brothers could be set for Guernsey blue plaque honour,"Plans have been submitted to honour the Le Patourel brothers, Guernsey natives who made significant contributions to their respective fields, with a blue plaque at their former home in the Fosse Andre, St Peter Port. John Herbert Le Patourel, the elder brother, was a leader in the field of medieval studies and a professor at the University of Cambridge. His groundbreaking research on feudalism and the history of Europe during the Middle Ages laid the foundation for future scholars in the field. Le Patourel's seminal work, ""The Forests of Normandy and Anjou,"" is still considered a classic in medieval studies today. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Frederick Le Patourel, also made a name for himself in the academic world, particularly in the field of maritime history. He spent his career at the University of Southampton, where he conducted extensive research on the history of the British navy and naval warfare. Le Patourel's book, ""The Naval War under Elizabeth I,"" is a comprehensive study of England's maritime conflicts during the latter half of the 16th century. The brothers' achievements were not limited to their academic pursuits. John Le Patourel served as a member of the British Academy, while Frederick was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. Both brothers also held positions in various learned societies, including the SociÃ©tÃ© Jersiaise and the Batelage Society. Despite their international careers, the Le Patourel brothers never forgot their Guernsey roots. They remained active in the local community and maintained close ties to their family and friends in the island. Their former home in the Fosse Andre, where they grew up, holds a special place in their hearts and represents a significant part of their personal history. The proposal to place a blue plaque at the Le Patourel brothers' former residence has been welcomed by the Guernsey community. The plaque, which will be unveiled later this year, is expected to attract tourists and scholars interested in the brothers' contributions to their respective fields. It will also serve as a reminder of the island's rich intellectual heritage and the achievements of its native sons. The Le Patourel brothers' story is a testament to the power of education and determination. Born and raised in Guernsey, they went on to make significant contributions to their fields and leave a lasting impact on academic research. Their achievements serve as an inspiration to future generations of Guernsey students and scholars, and the blue plaque will be a fitting tribute to their memory.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Device aids 'virtual' treatment of Leicester patients,"University Hospitals of Leicester Trust has announced that a small, portable blood oxygen monitor has enabled the treatment of 130 patients at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. The device, which is about the size of a smartphone, allows patients to take their own readings and are checked daily by hospital staff through remote consultations. The trust, which oversees the delivery of healthcare services in Leicester, Leicestershire, and Rutland, began using the monitors in March 2020, as the pandemic forced hospitals to prioritise in-patient care for those with the most critical conditions. The monitors were issued to patients with respiratory conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, who were at risk of worsening symptoms due to the virus. The use of the monitors has proven to be a success, with hospital staff able to remotely monitor patients' oxygen levels and provide timely advice and treatment. The trust's respiratory consultant, Dr Ramesh Arumugam, said: ""This technology has been a game-changer for us. It has enabled us to continue providing care for our patients with respiratory conditions while minimising the risk of exposure to Covid-19 in a hospital setting."" The monitors are connected to a secure online platform, which allows hospital staff to view patients' readings in real-time. Patients are advised to take readings at regular intervals throughout the day, usually every four hours, and to contact the hospital if their oxygen levels fall below a certain threshold. The trust's chief executive, Professor Ivan Brown, said: ""This innovation has allowed us to continue delivering high-quality care to our patients, even in these challenging times. It's a great example of how technology can be used to improve patient outcomes and reduce the pressure on our hospitals."" The use of remote monitoring devices is not limited to blood oxygen levels. The trust has also been using remote consultations for patients with other conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. The trust's director of digital transformation, Simon Evans, said: ""We have been exploring the use of telehealth and remote monitoring technologies for some time, but the pandemic has accelerated their adoption. These technologies not only improve patient care but also help to reduce the demand for hospital bed and save the NHS resources."" The trust's experience with remote monitoring and telehealth has caught the attention of other healthcare organisations in the UK and beyond. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the UK's health advisory body, has issued new guidance recommending the use of remote monitoring and telehealth for people with long-term conditions, including respiratory conditions. The use of remote monitoring and telehealth is not without its challenges, however. There are concerns about data security and patient privacy, as well as the need for reliable internet connectivity.

Monarch airline awaits package holiday licence decision,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch's licence by 24 hours on Saturday, providing a brief reprieve for the embattled airline amid uncertainty about its future. However, with the deadline now passed, the regulator has yet to announce a decision on what it means for the UK's fifth-largest carrier and its customers. Monarch, which flew more than six million passengers last year, entered administration last Monday after failing to secure a last-minute rescue deal. The CAA stepped in to protect customers, stating that all Monarch flights scheduled until midnight on Monday would operate as normal. Since then, Monarch has cancelled all future flights, leaving thousands of holidaymakers stranded abroad and at home, awaiting news on their refunds or rebooking options. The CAA has chartered planes to fly British passengers back to the UK, while it also works on securing alternative flights for those still overseas. The stakes are high for Monarch and its customers. The airline's collapse has left many with non-refundable travel arrangements and significant financial losses. Monarch's demise could also have wider implications for the UK tourism industry, particularly the package holiday sector. The CAA's decision to grant an extension to Monarch's licence further complicated matters. While it allowed the airline to continue flying for a day longer than originally planned, it also raised questions about Monarch's long-term prospects. Industry experts have suggested that the CAA may have granted the extension to allow Monarch to find a buyer or secure a rescue deal. However, with no such deal in sight, the regulator now faces a difficult decision. One option is to revoke Monarch's licence immediately, which would allow the CAA to wind down the airline's operations and begin the process of refunding passengers. Alternatively, the CAA could choose to keep Monarch's licence in place for a longer period, allowing the airline to continue flying while it works to find a buyer or secure a rescue deal. Whichever decision the CAA ultimately makes, it is likely to have far-reaching consequences. For Monarch's customers, it could mean the difference between a prompt refund or a lengthy wait. For the UK tourism industry, it could signal the end of an era for package holidays or the start of a new one. In the meantime, Monarch's employees and customers are left waiting for answers. The airline's collapse has raised serious questions about the future of the package holiday sector and the role of regulators in protecting consumers. As the CAA prepares to make its decision, the future of Monarch and the UK's package holiday industry hangs in the balance.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Tuition grants affecting Welsh universities',"Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, expressed concern over the policy of paying the majority of tuition fees for Welsh students through the Welsh Government's grants system. In a statement, he acknowledged the significant financial support provided by the Welsh Government, but warned of potential unintended consequences. ""While we welcome the ongoing financial commitment from the Welsh Government towards ensuring that students from Wales have access to higher education, it is essential that we consider the long-term implications of this policy,"" he said. ""The current system, where the government pays the tuition fees for the majority of Welsh students, may inadvertently create a disincentive for students to seek out sources of funding other than grants."" Riordan added that the grants system could limit students' financial independence and ability to develop essential life skills, such as managing their own finances and budgeting. ""We believe it is important for students to have some financial responsibility and to take ownership of their education,"" he stated. Moreover, the vice-chancellor expressed concerns about the sustainability of the grants system in the long term. ""With the ongoing financial challenges facing the Welsh Government, it is crucial that we examine alternatives to grant-funding as a means of supporting Welsh students,"" he emphasized. Riordan suggested that a more balanced approach could be adopted, one that encourages students to explore a range of funding options, including scholarships, bursaries, and student loans. ""Such an approach would empower students to make informed decisions about their financial situation, while also ensuring that the Welsh higher education sector remains financially viable and competitive,"" he explained. The Universities Wales chair also called for a collaborative dialogue between the Welsh Government, universities, and students to explore potential solutions and alternatives. ""We must work together to find a balanced approach that will provide Welsh students with the necessary financial support while also fostering their independence and preparing them for the future,"" he concluded. The issue of tuition grants and their impact on Welsh universities has gained increasing attention in recent years, with some experts arguing that the grants system could restrict access to higher education for students from low-income backgrounds. Meanwhile, others contend that the current system encourages students to rely excessively on government funding, potentially limiting their future employment prospects. As Welsh universities navigate these complex issues, they continue to emphasize the importance of fostering a robust and sustainable financial model that supports students while also maintaining the long-term viability of the higher education sector. The ongoing dialogue between stakeholders will be crucial in shaping the future of higher education in Wales.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
NHS pressure: Hospital corridors 'the new emergency wards',"By Nick Triggle, Health correspondent The warning comes as figures for the NHS in England showed January was one of the most difficult months on record. Record numbers of patients were forced to spend long hours in hospital corridors, as the health service struggled to cope with demand. According to data from NHS England, more than 50,000 patients spent more than 12 hours in A&E departments last month, while over 14,000 spent more than 12 hours on a trolley in a corridor. This is a significant increase compared to the same period last year and is a clear indication of the pressure the health service is under. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the situation was ""grim"" and called for urgent action. ""We've got a system that's struggling to cope with the demand that's being put upon it,"" he said. ""There are no easy solutions, but we need to invest in social care, community services, and primary care to take some of the pressure off hospitals."" The problem is not just limited to A&E departments. The pressure on hospitals means that many patients are delayed getting a bed on a ward, leading to long stays in corridors. In some cases, patients have even been forced to spend the night on chairs or in wheelchairs. The situation is particularly challenging for the most vulnerable patients, such as the elderly or those with complex health needs. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has expressed concern that these patients are at risk of harm due to the lengthy stays in corridors. ""It's unacceptable that patients are being left to wait in corridors for long periods,"" said Patricia Marquis, the RCN's professional lead for older people. ""These delays can have a negative impact on their health and wellbeing, and can cause distress and anxiety."" The NHS in England is currently facing a number of challenges, including a shortage of beds, staff, and funding. The government has announced a number of measures to address these issues, including an extra Â£335m for social care and an additional Â£2.5bn for the NHS this year. However, some experts argue that these measures are not enough to address the long-term challenges facing the health service. The situation is likely to get worse before it gets better, with the winter months traditionally being a peak period for demand on the NHS. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine has warned that the number of patients attending A&E departments could reach record levels this winter. In the meantime, patients and their families are being urged to use alternative services where possible, such as pharmacies, GP surgeries, and NHS 111, to help ease the pressure on hospitals. The NHS is also encouraging people to take simple steps to stay well, such as getting a flu jab and",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Celebrities join calls to axe sixth-form 'learning tax',"By Judith Burns, Education reporter, BBC News Unlike schools and academies, sixth-form colleges in England are unable to claim back their Value Added Tax (VAT) costs. The government's current policy means that these institutions, which provide post-16 education, must absorb the financial burden themselves. This issue has been highlighted once again with the publication of the comprehensive spending review. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced that the government would be freezing the schools budget in real terms between 2022 and 2025. Sixth-form colleges, however, were not mentioned in the statement. In response, celebrities and organisations have joined calls to axe the so-called 'learning tax' on sixth-form colleges. They argue that this tax unfairly disadvantages students in these institutions, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Actor and sixth-form college alumnus, Tom Hardy, recently added his voice to the campaign. He tweeted, ""Sixth Form Colleges are crucial for students who don't have the means to attend university. They deserve the same funding as schools. #FairFunding4SixthForms"" The National Union of Students (NUS) has also backed the campaign. NUS President, Larissa Kennedy, said, ""We cannot allow sixth form colleges to be left behind. They provide vital opportunities for students who cannot afford to go to university. It's time for the government to realise the value of these institutions and provide them with fair funding."" The Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) has estimated that the abolition of the VAT would save sixth-form colleges around Â£300 million over the next five years. This money could then be reinvested into better facilities, resources, and teacher training. The SFCA's Chief Executive, Bill Watkins, said, ""We cannot continue to ask sixth-form colleges to absorb this cost. It's time for the government to recognise the value of these institutions and provide them with the same funding as schools."" The education select committee has also called for an end to the 'learning tax'. MP and committee chair, Robert Halfon, said, ""Sixth-form colleges play a vital role in our education system. They deserve the same funding as schools and academies. I urge the government to reconsider this policy and provide fair funding for sixth-form colleges."" Despite these calls, the government has yet to respond. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said, ""We are committed to ensuring that all students have access to high-quality education.

Edinburgh's Christmas: Market did not have 2018 planning consent,"Edinburgh's Christmas market, a much-anticipated annual event that draws tourists and locals alike, faced unexpected challenges this year as Underbelly, the company responsible for organising the market, was still waiting for planning permission to operate in 2019/20. The absence of the necessary consents forced the council to announce that the market would not go ahead as planned on its scheduled opening day, Saturday. Underbelly, known for producing a range of cultural events across the city, had submitted an application for planning consent back in March 2019. However, the application was rejected due to concerns regarding traffic management, noise levels, and the impact on local residents. The company was given until the end of October to resubmit a revised application with the necessary mitigations. Despite the setback, Underbelly remained optimistic and continued to work closely with the council to address the concerns and secure the necessary approvals. However, the granting of a building warrant, a crucial permit required to construct the market infrastructure, had also yet to be obtained. The lack of this permit was causing further delays, and the opening of the market was pushed back indefinitely. The decision to postpone the market came as a disappointment to many, with some stallholders expressing frustration and concern over the financial implications. The loss of potential revenue during the crucial holiday season was a significant blow, and the uncertainty surrounding the event's future was causing worry and uncertainty. The council, acknowledging the economic importance of the market and the impact on those involved, expressed its commitment to working with Underbelly to find a solution. Council leaders were hopeful that a resolution could be reached soon, and that the market could still open before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Edinburgh residents and visitors were left waiting to see if and when the market would open. The absence of the festive market, a beloved tradition in the city, was felt keenly, and many took to social media to express their disappointment and frustration. Underbelly, for their part, remained resolute in their commitment to bringing the market to Edinburgh. The company had a long-standing relationship with the city and was determined to find a way to address the concerns and secure the necessary approvals. The fate of Edinburgh's Christmas market remained uncertain, but one thing was clear: the determination of all involved to ensure that the city's festive spirit would ultimately prevail.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Diana documentary: What the critics said,"The highly anticipated BBC documentary, ""Diana: In Her Own Words,"" which aired last week, received a mixed response from critics. The program, which featured previously unheard audiotapes of Princess Diana speaking candidly about her upbringing, her troubled marriage to Prince Charles, and her public life, resonated with some viewers while leaving others unimpressed. For those who were drawn to the documentary, it offered a rare glimpse into the private thoughts and feelings of the beloved royal figure. The tapes, recorded in the late 1990s, allowed viewers to hear Diana's reflections on her experiences in her own voice, providing a level of intimacy that was both captivating and poignant. One critic, writing for The Guardian, praised the documentary for its ""powerful and moving"" portrayal of Diana's life and legacy. The reviewer noted that the tapes provided a ""unique insight into the mind of a woman who was both a public figure and a private individual,"" and that the production team's decision to let Diana's words speak for themselves was a masterstroke. Another critic, writing for The Independent, agreed that the documentary was a ""fascinating and compelling watch,"" but noted that it was not without its flaws. The reviewer pointed out that some of the program's reenactments and voiceovers felt unnecessary and detracted from the impact of Diana's words. However, not all critics were impressed. Some felt that the documentary was overhyped and that the tapes did not reveal anything truly groundbreaking about Diana or her relationship with the royal family. One review, published in The Telegraph, dismissed the program as ""an exercise in voyeurism"" and questioned whether it was appropriate to air such personal recordings without the consent of those involved. Despite the varying criticisms, it is clear that ""Diana: In Her Own Words"" struck a chord with many viewers. The program drew an audience of over 11 million people in the UK alone, and sparked widespread discussion about Diana's life, her legacy, and the role of the media in shaping public perception. Ultimately, the success of the documentary can be attributed to the enduring fascination with Diana and her story. The tapes offered a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who was both a symbol of hope and a tragic figure, and provided a reminder of the complex and multifaceted nature of her public and private lives. Whether or not the documentary was a critical success, it was certainly a powerful and moving reminder of the lasting impact that Diana had on the world.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ex-Cardiff children's home boss jailed for sex abuse,"Patrick Grant, 69, from Cardiff, was convicted at Inner London Crown Court of three counts of indecent assault, bringing an end to a harrowing chapter for the victims who bravely came forward with their stories. The former boss of a children's home in south Wales had been on trial since early March, facing allegations that spanned over three decades. Grant, who had worked in the care sector for over 40 years, had previously been hailed for his dedication to helping vulnerable children. However, the faÃ§ade of a respected and trusted figure began to crumble as allegations of sexual abuse against him surfaced. The first victim, now in their 50s, described how Grant had subjected them to years of abuse, beginning when they were just 11 years old. The details of the incidents were harrowing, with the victim recalling how Grant would invite them into his office late at night and make them perform sex acts. The victim's bravery in coming forward sparked a wave of similar allegations from others who had also been in Grant's care. The court heard how Grant had used his position of authority to manipulate and groom young children, promising them special privileges and attention in exchange for their compliance. The victims, who were all under the age of 16 at the time of the abuse, described feeling trapped and powerless, fearing that no one would believe them if they spoke out. As more victims came forward, it became clear that Grant's abuse had gone on for decades, with some of the incidents occurring as recently as 2015. The police investigation that followed uncovered further evidence, including witness statements from former colleagues who had suspected something was amiss but had not spoken out due to fear or doubt. Grant's trial was a difficult and emotional experience for all those involved, with many victims choosing to give evidence via video link due to the trauma they had experienced. The court heard how the abuse had left them with long-term psychological damage, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite the harrowing details and the emotional toll on the victims, there was a sense of relief and closure as Grant was finally brought to justice. The judge handed down a sentence of 12 years, with an additional five years on licence. The victims, who had waited decades for this moment, expressed their gratitude to the police, the legal team, and the public for their support. As Grant was led away in handcuffs, it was a stark reminder of the devastating impact that child sexual abuse can have on victims and their families. It was also a reminder that no one is immune to such abuse, and that it is essential that we continue to raise awareness, provide support, and hold perpetrators accountable.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Martin McGuinness hopeful of welfare deal by middle of week,"Sinn FÃ©in's decision to withdraw support for the welfare reform bill last week has sent shockwaves through Stormont and raised questions about the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland. The bill, which aimed to introduce welfare changes aligned with those in the rest of the UK, was a key element of the Stormont House Agreement reached in 2014. However, the party's objection to elements of the bill, particularly those related to the implementation of welfare reform, led to their withdrawal of support. Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister, has expressed hope that a deal can be reached by the middle of this week. Speaking to the BBC, he stated, ""We want to see progress. We're hoping that we'll be able to reach an agreement by the middle of the week."" He went on to explain that the issues at hand were complex and required careful consideration, but that a resolution was necessary to prevent further instability in Northern Ireland's political landscape. The lack of a functioning Executive has already had a significant impact on the region, with crucial decisions on a range of issues, including health and education, left unaddressed. The political stalemate has also raised concerns about the impact on the peace process and the potential for renewed tensions in the region. Despite the challenges, there are signs that progress is being made. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been ongoing since the welfare bill was withdrawn, with both parties expressing a desire to find a resolution. The UK government has also been involved in the discussions, with Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland Secretary, stating that she was ""encouraged by the tone and tenor"" of the talks. However, there are still significant hurdles to overcome. Sinn FÃ©in has demanded that the welfare reforms be delayed until after the Assembly elections in May, while the DUP has been insistent that they be implemented as soon as possible. The parties are also at odds over a range of other issues, including the renewable energy sector and the proposed new flag legislation. As the talks continue, there is a growing sense of unease among the public. Many are concerned about the impact of the political instability on their daily lives, while others are worried about the potential for renewed violence. The coming days are expected to be critical in determining the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and the region as a whole. In the meantime, the Executive remains suspended, and crucial decisions are being made on a largely ad hoc basis by civil servants. The situation is far from ideal, and all parties involved will need to show flexibility and a willingness to compromise if a resolution is to be found. The hope is that a deal can be reached by the middle of the week, but only time will tell if this is a realistic expectation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ex-MI6 boss warns over electronic voting risk,"Sir John Sawers, the former chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), expressed his concerns over the security of electronic voting systems to the BBC in a recent interview. He emphasized that the traditional method of casting a ballot using pencil and paper is ""actually much more secure"" than relying on technology. Sir John cautioned, ""The risk of hacking or manipulation of electronic voting systems is a real and growing threat. We've seen instances of cyberattacks on political organizations and even entire countries' infrastructure. The potential for these attacks to target and manipulate voting systems is a serious concern."" The ex-MI6 boss pointed out that electronic voting systems present a unique set of vulnerabilities that are not present in traditional paper-based voting. He explained, ""Electronic voting systems rely on complex technology, and with that comes a greater potential for security breaches. Hackers could potentially infiltrate the system, manipulate data, or even disrupt the entire process."" Sir John's warning comes as several countries, including the United States, have begun exploring the use of electronic voting systems to make the process more efficient and convenient for voters. However, the former spy chief emphasized that the benefits of such systems must be weighed against the risks. ""It's important to remember that every additional layer of technology brings with it new vulnerabilities,"" Sir John stated. ""While electronic voting systems may offer convenience, we must ensure that they do not compromise the security and integrity of the democratic process."" The British intelligence veteran urged that more resources be dedicated to securing electronic voting systems and that rigorous testing be carried out to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities. He also emphasized the importance of public education on the risks of electronic voting and the measures being taken to mitigate them. ""We cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to the security of our democratic processes,"" Sir John concluded. ""Whether it's through traditional paper-based voting or electronic systems, we must ensure that every vote is counted fairly and accurately. The security of our democracies is at stake."" Despite the convenience that electronic voting systems offer, Sir John Sawers' warnings serve as a reminder that the security and integrity of the democratic process must always be a top priority. As countries continue to explore the use of electronic voting systems, it is essential that they are subjected to rigorous security testing and that the public is kept informed of the measures being taken to protect against potential threats.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Ballymena: Green Pastures 'urban village' is approved by councillors,"By Louise Cullen, BBC NI News Green Pastures church plans to build an urban village on the edge of Ballymena, with the development set to include homes, a community centre, and green spaces. The proposal was given the green light by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council's planning committee on Wednesday. The proposed urban village, which will be located on the outskirts of the town, will consist of 40 homes, a community centre, and extensive green spaces, according to the plans submitted by the church. The development is intended to create a vibrant, self-contained community, with a focus on sustainability and social cohesion. The plans have been met with widespread support from local residents and community groups, who have welcomed the prospect of new housing and community facilities in the area. Ballymena Town Councillor, John Palmer, expressed his delight at the decision, saying, ""This development is an excellent opportunity to create a thriving, sustainable community on the outskirts of Ballymena, and I'm thrilled that the planning committee has approved the plans."" The urban village project is part of a wider regeneration initiative in the area, which aims to transform the surrounding neighbourhoods and improve the overall quality of life for local residents. Green Pastures church has been working closely with local stakeholders, including the council, community groups, and residents, to ensure that the development meets the needs of the local community and is in line with local planning policies. The community centre at the heart of the development will provide a range of facilities for local residents, including a cafÃ©, meeting rooms, and a multi-purpose hall. The centre will also offer a range of activities and services, including youth clubs, community events, and educational programmes, to help foster a sense of community and social cohesion. The extensive green spaces within the development will provide a range of recreational opportunities for residents, including walking trails, picnic areas, and community gardens. The green spaces will also help to create a healthier environment, with the potential for community-led initiatives such as allotments and community orchards. Construction on the urban village is expected to begin in the coming months, with the first homes scheduled for completion by the end of the year. The development is anticipated to create around 100 jobs during the construction phase, as well as ongoing employment opportunities within the community centre and associated facilities. The approval of the Green Pastures urban village development is a significant step forward in the regeneration of the area and is expected to bring numerous benefits to the local community, including new housing, community facilities, and employment opportunities. The development is also in line with the council's commitment to promoting sustainable, self-contained communities and improving the overall quality of life for local residents.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

As the world continues to come to terms with the Manchester attack, Ariana Grande's heartfelt words of love and compassion serve as a shining light in the darkness.

Why good economics can make for bad politics,"Soutik Biswas, Delhi correspondent India's beleaguered Congress-led ruling coalition in Delhi is discovering that, in its attempts to push through major economic reforms, good economics can make for bad politics. On Tuesday evening, its unpredictable ally the Trinamool Congress pulled out from the government, dealing a significant blow to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's plans to overhaul the economy. The Trinamool Congress, led by the fiery Mamata Banerjee, has long been opposed to key economic policies such as the land acquisition bill and the nuclear liability bill. The coalition's collapse comes at a time when the Indian economy is showing signs of recovery, with the latest GDP growth figures showing a modest increase to 6.6% in the third quarter of this fiscal year. But the political instability threatens to derail the government's efforts to push through reforms, which many economists believe are necessary to put the Indian economy on a sustainable growth path. The coalition's collapse also comes at a time when India is facing multiple economic challenges, including a widening current account deficit, high inflation, and a burdensome fiscal deficit. The Indian political landscape is complex, and economic reforms often face stiff opposition from various quarters. In the past, attempts to liberalize the Indian economy have faced significant resistance from powerful vested interests, including farmers, trade unions, and regional political parties. The Congress-led coalition came to power in 2004, promising to deliver on economic reforms. But its inability to push through key reforms has led to growing frustration among investors and economists, who see India's political instability as a major barrier to economic growth. The Trinamool Congress's exit from the government is likely to lead to fresh elections in West Bengal, which could further delay the implementation of economic reforms. The coalition's collapse also raises questions about the future of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which has been in power since 2004. The Indian economy is at a crucial juncture, and the political instability threatens to derail the government's efforts to push through much-needed reforms. Economic reforms can be unpopular, and politicians often face pressure from various quarters to abandon them. But in the long run, good economics can lead to sustainable economic growth and improved living standards for the Indian people. The Indian political class needs to recognize that economic reforms are not a zero-sum game. While some may lose out in the short term, the long-term benefits of economic reforms can far outweigh the short-term costs. It is essential that political considerations do not override economic considerations, as this can have long-term consequences for the Indian economy and its people. As India navigates the complex political landscape, it is important that economic considerations take center stage",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Enterprise zones tax break bids expected after delay,"A form of tax cuts will be available in a zone on Deeside, but the Treasury has not had proposals from other enterprise zones seeking similar incentives, following a delay in the announcement of the tax break scheme. The enterprise zone in Flintshire, North Wales, was confirmed as one of the areas set to benefit from the tax breaks by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng earlier this year. The zones are designed to stimulate economic growth and job creation in deprived areas by offering businesses reduced business rates, simplified planning regulations, and other incentives. Businesses that move into the Deeside enterprise zone will be eligible for 100% business rates relief for five years, as well as a range of other tax incentives, including enhanced capital allowances and a simplified business rates system. However, the announcement of tax breaks for other enterprise zones across the UK has been delayed, leaving businesses in those areas uncertain about their future prospects. The Treasury has said that it has not yet received proposals from other enterprise zones seeking the tax incentives. The delay has caused frustration for some business leaders, who argue that the tax breaks are essential to attract new businesses and create jobs in deprived areas. The British Chambers of Commerce has called on the government to provide clarity on the status of the tax breaks as soon as possible. ""Businesses in enterprise zones are facing significant uncertainty,"" said Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce. ""They need certainty and clarity to plan for the future, and the delay in announcing the tax breaks is causing unnecessary anxiety."" The government has said that it is working to finalise the details of the tax break scheme and will announce the details as soon as possible. In the meantime, businesses in enterprise zones are being encouraged to continue with their plans for expansion and investment. The enterprise zone in Deeside is already home to a number of businesses, including Airbus, Tata Steel, and Toyota Manufacturing UK. The zone is expected to create thousands of new jobs in the coming years, with the tax breaks set to provide an added boost to the local economy. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the tax breaks for other enterprise zones, some businesses are still planning to move into those areas, hoping that the incentives will be announced in the near future. ""We're still planning to move into the enterprise zone in Hull,"" said John Smith, CEO of a manufacturing company. ""We believe that the tax breaks will be announced soon, and we're confident that they will make a significant difference to our business."" The delay in announcing the tax breaks for other enterprise zones is just the latest setback for businesses in those areas, who have faced a number of challenges in recent years, including Brexit uncertainty and the impact of the pandemic. As the government works to finalise the details of the tax break scheme, businesses in enterprise zones will be watching closely for any developments, hoping that",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Germany migrant shelter fire 'cheered by onlookers',"The fire in the town of Bautzen in the early hours of Sunday morning destroyed the roof of a former hotel, which was being converted into a migrant shelter. Police said some of the crowd tried to prevent firefighters from doing their job, cheering and jeering as the blaze engulfed the building. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a large group of people gathered outside the shelter, some of whom were shouting and throwing bottles at the emergency services as they arrived on the scene. The cause of the fire is not yet clear, but it comes at a time of heightened tension in Germany over the issue of migration. The shelter, which was due to open this week, was intended to house around 200 asylum seekers. It was one of several such facilities being built in the town, which has become a focal point for the anti-migrant sentiment that has been simmering in parts of Germany for years. The fire has sparked outrage among political leaders and human rights groups, who have condemned the behaviour of the onlookers and called for an end to the violence and hatred that has marred the debate over migration in Germany. ""This is a disgraceful and shameful display of intolerance and xenophobia,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel in a statement. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be divided by hatred and fear. We must stand together as a country and welcome those in need of our help and protection."" The German Red Cross, which was set to operate the shelter, expressed its deep sadness and disappointment at the events. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of the building, but more importantly, we are shocked and appalled by the behaviour of those who cheered on the fire,"" said a spokesperson for the charity. The fire in Bautzen is not an isolated incident. In recent months, there have been numerous attacks on migrant shelters and refugee homes across Germany, with arson being a particular concern. In one instance, a shelter in the town of Altenkessel was set on fire just hours after it opened, leaving around 100 people without a place to sleep. As the investigation into the cause of the fire continues, the focus is on preventing further incidents and bringing those responsible to justice. ""We will not be intimidated by hate and violence,"" said Merkel. ""We will continue to build shelters and offer support to those in need, and we will work to address the underlying causes of this intolerance and division."" The fire in Bautzen is a stark reminder of the challenges that Germany, and indeed Europe, faces in dealing with the issue of migration. It is a complex and deeply divisive issue, and one that requires a thoughtful, compassionate, and inclusive response. As Merkel noted, ""We must stand together as a country and welcome those in need of our help and protection."" Let us hope that this tragic event",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Wild animals circus ban passes first Holyrood vote,"MSPs unanimously signed off the general principles of the wild animals circus ban in the first vote at Holyrood, making it a significant milestone not only for Scotland but also for the entire United Kingdom. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham expressed her delight at the historic decision, stating that it was a ""great day for animal welfare."" The Scottish Government's proposal to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses has been a subject of intense debate in recent years. Animal welfare advocates have long argued that wild animals do not belong in the confined and often inadequate conditions of travelling circuses. They believe that these animals suffer physically and psychologically, and that they deserve to live in environments that allow them to exhibit natural behaviors. Opponents of the ban, however, argue that travelling circuses provide employment opportunities and that animals are well cared for. They also point out that many animals in circuses are rescued and rehabilitated, and that they are not kept in poor conditions. However, studies have shown that wild animals do not thrive in the confined and artificial environments of travelling circuses, and that they often suffer from stress, depression, and other health problems. The ban, which is expected to come into force later this year, has been welcomed by animal welfare organizations, who have been campaigning for such a measure for many years. One such organization, the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), hailed the decision as a ""landmark moment"" and called on other parts of the UK to follow Scotland's lead. ""We are absolutely thrilled that MSPs have voted in favor of banning wild animals in travelling circuses,"" said Kirsten Campbell, SSPCA's Head of Political Affairs. ""This is a massive step forward for animal welfare in Scotland, and we hope that it will set a precedent for the rest of the UK."" The ban is expected to affect around ten traveling circuses in Scotland, which currently use animals such as elephants, tigers, lions, and camels in their shows. The Scottish Government has assured circus operators that they will be provided with support and advice to help them transition to using alternative acts, such as those featuring human performers or animals that are not wild. Animal welfare advocates have also expressed their hope that the ban will lead to a broader conversation about animal rights and the treatment of animals in other industries, such as agriculture and entertainment. They believe that the ban is just the beginning of a larger movement towards recognizing and protecting the rights of animals. ""This is a great day for animal welfare in Scotland, but it is also just the beginning,"" said Campbell. ""We need to continue the conversation about animal rights and work towards creating a world where animals are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.""

Essex County Council HQ swastikas should be removed says UKIP group,"Earlier this week, it was reported that the markings on Essex County Council's County Hall, a building constructed between 1928 and 1939 in Chelmsford, had been deemed ""potentially upsetting"" due to the presence of swastikas. These carved symbols, synonymous with the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during World War II, have sparked controversy and calls for their removal. The discovery of the swastikas, hidden in plain sight for decades, has left many feeling uneasy and disturbed. The historic building, which serves as the headquarters for Essex County Council, is a place of work and a symbol of local government. However, the presence of such offensive symbols undermines the inclusive and welcoming environment that the council aims to promote. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) has added their voice to the growing chorus of those calling for the removal of the swastikas. A spokesperson for the Essex branch of UKIP stated, ""As a responsible and inclusive political party, UKIP strongly condemns any form of hate speech or symbolism. The swastikas at County Hall are offensive and have no place in modern society. We call on Essex County Council to take swift action and remove these markings without delay."" The council has yet to make a formal statement on the matter, but it is understood that they are considering their options. Some have suggested that the swastikas could be covered up or removed in a way that preserves the historical integrity of the building. Others argue that the swastikas should be left in place as a reminder of the dark chapters of our past, while providing context and education about their offensive meaning. The presence of the swastikas at County Hall is a reminder of the importance of education and open dialogue about the history of hate speech and symbols. It also serves as a reminder of the need to challenge and speak out against such symbols when they appear. As a society, we have a responsibility to learn from the past and to work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant future. The Essex branch of the Holocaust Education Trust has offered to provide educational resources and workshops to help raise awareness about the history and significance of the swastika. They believe that through education and open dialogue, we can better understand the impact of hate speech and symbols and work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant society. As the controversy surrounding the swastikas at County Hall continues to unfold, it is clear that this is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and thoughtful action. Regardless of how the council chooses to address the situation, it is important that we as a community come together to condemn hate speech and symbols and to work towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant future.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

He spoke to the press about an incident that occurred just before her tragic death. ""Amber seemed upset that day in school,"" Wallace recalled. ""She came to me after class and asked if I could give her a lift home because her mother and step-father were dealing with their pet, which had gotten into something it shouldn't have."" Wallace, a caring and empathetic man, agreed to help. As they drove through the quiet streets of their small town, Amber shared her concerns with him. Her voice trembled as she spoke, her eyes filled with tears. ""She felt overlooked in her own home,"" Wallace said. ""She mentioned that her mother and step-father seemed to care more for their dog than they did for her. Amber felt that her needs were being ignored, and she was desperate for attention and affection."" This revelation came as a shock to Wallace, who had always seen Amber as a bright and capable student. He encouraged her to talk to her parents about her feelings, but she seemed hesitant. ""She said she didn't want to cause any trouble,"" Wallace explained. ""She was afraid of how her parents would react. Amber felt trapped and alone, and I could sense the weight of her burden."" As they approached her house, Amber asked Wallace to wait for her in the car while she went inside to fetch something. He complied, feeling a growing sense of unease. A few minutes later, however, Amber didn't return. Wallace waited for what felt like an eternity before deciding to check on her. He found her hanging in her bedroom, lifeless and unresponsive. The news of her death sent shockwaves through their community, leaving many to wonder what could have been done to prevent it. In the aftermath of Amber's tragic demise, her teachers, friends, and family members have come forward to share their memories and pay tribute to the young girl.

As Wallace reflected on the last days of Amber's life, he felt a deep sense of regret for not being able to help her in the way she needed. He vowed to use her memory as a catalyst for change, working to create a more supportive and nurturing environment for all students in his care.

Leeds war hero's statue could be moved to heritage centre,"Flt Sgt Arthur Aaron, from Leeds, was killed on a bombing mission in Italy on the night of 11th February 1945. The RAF pilot was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for gallantry, the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy, in recognition of his extraordinary actions that fateful night. Seventy-six years have passed since that tragic night, but the memory of Flt Sgt Aaron's heroism lives on in his hometown. His statue, which stands proudly in Leeds City Square, has become a symbol of courage and resilience for the people of Leeds. However, there have been recent discussions about the future of the statue. Some believe that it would be more fitting for the Leeds Museum and Art Gallery, which houses an extensive collection of the city's rich history, to be the new home of the Flt Sgt Aaron statue. The heritage centre, located in the heart of Leeds, would provide a more appropriate setting for the statue, offering visitors a deeper understanding of the man behind the hero. The centre could provide context to Flt Sgt Aaron's life, his service in the RAF, and the events leading up to his Victoria Cross award. Moreover, the move would allow the statue to be protected from the elements and potential damage that comes with being situated in an open public space. The Leeds Museum and Art Gallery has the resources and expertise to ensure the statue's preservation. However, some argue that the statue in the city square serves as a reminder of the sacrifice made by Flt Sgt Aaron and the many other servicemen and women who gave their lives in the line of duty. The statue is a source of inspiration for the people of Leeds, particularly the young generation, to strive for excellence and bravery. The decision to move the statue is not an easy one. It's a matter of balancing the need for preservation, education, and sentiment. Regardless of where the statue ends up, Flt Sgt Aaron's legacy remains etched in the history of Leeds and the UK as a whole. The legacy of Flt Sgt Aaron extends beyond the city limits. His story has captured the imagination of people across the globe, inspiring thousands to pursue their dreams and to never give up in the face of adversity.

Councils fixed more potholes as budgets grew,"Some 330,000 more potholes were filled on roads across the UK between 2018/19 and 2019/20, with spending on roads maintenance increasing by 20%, according to a new study. However, the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) report reveals that this progress may not be sustainable as local authorities face continued budget pressures. The AIA's Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey shows that local councils spent Â£3.1 billion on maintaining the roads in 2019/20, a significant increase from the Â£2.6 billion spent in the previous year. The rise in funding led to a considerable improvement in road conditions, with councils able to fill 2.9 million potholes. The improvement in road maintenance was most notably seen in London, where 230,000 more potholes were filled compared to the previous year. Other metropolitan areas, such as Manchester and Birmingham, also reported significant reductions in pothole numbers. However, despite the progress made, the AIA warns that the financial pressures faced by local authorities could lead to a reduction in spending on road maintenance in the future. The report states that, without a sustained increase in funding, there is a risk that progress made in recent years could be undone. Mike Robinson, the executive director of the AIA, said: ""The latest figures show that the investment made by local authorities in road maintenance over the past year has had a positive impact on the condition of the roads. However, this progress is at risk due to the financial pressures that local authorities continue to face. It is essential that governments at all levels recognise the importance of investing in our roads to ensure that the progress made is sustained."" The AIA's warning comes as the government prepares to set out its spending plans for the next financial year. The organisation is calling on the government to provide local authorities with the funding they need to maintain the country's roads and prevent the condition of the network from deteriorating further. The AIA's report also highlights the importance of preventative maintenance in reducing the number of potholes and the need for costly repairs. The organisation is urging local authorities to prioritise this approach to ensure that roads are kept in good condition and to reduce the need for reactive repairs. The study also reveals that the condition of roads in England and Wales remains poor, with almost a quarter of local roads classed as being in poor or very poor condition. The AIA is calling on the government to invest in improving the network to ensure that roads are safe and reliable for all users. In conclusion, the increase in spending on roads maintenance in 2019/20 led to a significant decrease in the number of potholes on UK roads.

Hong Kong student's death sparks impromptu protests and vigils,"Alex Chow, a 22-year-old university student in Hong Kong, tragically lost his life on Monday morning during a police operation to clear a crowded area. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are still unclear, but eyewitnesses reported that he fell from the ledge of a multi-story car park. The news of Chow's death sent shockwaves through Hong Kong society and sparked impromptu protests and vigils across the city. Thousands of people, many of them students, gathered at the site of the incident to mourn and express their anger and frustration. The protesters demanded answers from the authorities about how Chow came to fall from the car park during the police operation. They also called for an independent investigation into the incident, as well as greater accountability and transparency from the Hong Kong police force. The mood among the protesters was somber but defiant. Many carried candles and flowers, while others held up banners and signs calling for justice. Some spoke of their own experiences of police brutality and expressed their solidarity with the Chow's family. The protests continued into the night, with some turning into violent clashes between the police and the protesters. Police used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowds, while some protesters threw bricks and other projectiles. The violence only served to fuel the anger and frustration of the protesters, and the situation showed no signs of easing. The incident has once again highlighted the deep-rooted tensions between the people of Hong Kong and the authorities, and many are calling for meaningful dialogue and reform. The death of Alex Chow has also sparked renewed international attention on the situation in Hong Kong. Human rights organizations and governments around the world have expressed their concern and called for an independent investigation into the incident. The Hong Kong government has condemned the violence and expressed its condolences to the Chow family. However, many Hong Kong people feel that the government has not done enough to address the root causes of the unrest and that meaningful dialogue and reform are urgently needed. As the situation in Hong Kong continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the people of Hong Kong are not going to be silenced. The death of Alex Chow has galvanized a new generation of activists, determined to fight for their rights and demand accountability from their leaders. The future of Hong Kong remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the spirit of democracy and freedom will continue to burn brightly in the hearts and minds of the people.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Sheffield family 'betrayed' over gambling death case,"Chris Bruney, a young man of 25 years old from Sheffield, tragically lost his life due to the reckless actions of a gambling firm. The heart-wrenching story has left his family feeling betrayed and outraged, as it came to light that PT Entertainment Services, the company in question, failed to carry out the necessary checks to ensure Chris could afford the VIP status they bestowed upon him. The Gambling Commission (GC) has since launched an investigation into the matter, stating that the company could have prevented Chris's death by implementing proper due diligence procedures. According to reports, Chris, who had a history of mental health issues, was given access to high-stakes gambling rooms and large credit lines, despite showing signs of financial instability. The Bruney family is now seeking answers and justice for their loved one, who they believe was taken advantage of by the gambling industry. Speaking to the BBC, Chris's mother, Emma, expressed her devastation and anger at the situation. ""I can't believe this has happened. Chris had his whole life ahead of him. He had so much potential. And for this to happen, it just feels like a total betrayal. We trusted the gambling industry to look after our son, to make sure he was safe. But instead, they gave him access to something that ultimately took his life,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. The GC has stated that it is important for gambling firms to take a proactive approach to identifying and protecting vulnerable individuals. This includes checking customers' financial and personal circumstances before granting them VIP status or access to high-stakes gambling. ""We are deeply concerned about this case and are working closely with the police to establish the full facts. Gambling businesses have a responsibility to ensure that their customers are not being harmed, and this includes carrying out appropriate checks to identify and protect those who may be at risk of harm,"" a spokesperson for the GC said. The Bruney family's story is a tragic reminder of the potential dangers of gambling, particularly for those who may be vulnerable due to mental health issues or financial instability. It also highlights the need for greater regulation and oversight of the gambling industry to ensure that vulnerable individuals are protected from harm. As the investigation into Chris's death continues, the Bruney family continues to grieve and seek answers. They hope that their story will raise awareness of the risks associated with gambling and bring about meaningful change in the industry. ""We just want to make sure that no other family has to go through what we're going through. We want to make a difference, to make sure that gambling firms are held accountable for their actions. And most importantly, we want to honour Chris's memory by ensuring that his life was not lost in vain,"" Emma said, her voice filled with determination.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
US 'preparing indictment against Julian Assange' of WikiLeaks,"The reports of an imminent indictment against Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, sent shockwaves through the journalistic community and beyond, as the US justice system appeared poised to take a significant step in the long-running saga of the controversial organization. The news came as a filing in a separate court case inadvertently hinted at the developing situation. The error-ridden document, which was later corrected, contained references to Assange and WikiLeaks, leading many to speculate that the US government was gearing up to bring charges against the Australian national. The filing was made in the Eastern District of Virginia, which is known for its handling of high-profile national security cases. Justice Department officials quickly moved to downplay the significance of the filing, insisting that it was a mistake and that no such indictment had been prepared. However, the damage had already been done, and the rumors continued to swirl around the internet. Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations, which were later dropped, has long been a target of the US government due to WikiLeaks' publication of a vast trove of classified documents in 2010. These leaks, which included diplomatic cables and military reports, exposed a range of sensitive information and caused diplomatic upheaval around the world. The potential indictment against Assange could mark a significant escalation in the US's efforts to hold the WikiLeaks founder accountable for his actions. The US government has accused Assange of conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain and publish the classified information. Assange, who maintains that he is a journalist protected by the First Amendment, has vehemently denied the allegations against him. He has also expressed concern about the potential consequences of being extradited to the US, where he could face espionage charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. The developing situation has sparked a fierce debate among free speech advocates, who argue that the potential indictment could set a dangerous precedent for investigative journalism. Others, however, point to the sensitive nature of the information that was leaked and the potential harm it caused to national security. With the situation continuing to unfold, it remains to be seen what the next move will be in the long-running saga of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. One thing is certain, though: the implications of this case go far beyond the individual involved and could have significant ramifications for the future of investigative journalism in the digital age.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Plaid Cymru call for all Commons debates to be digital,"With the UK under lockdown and MPs returning from recess on Tuesday, members of parliament will take part in hybrid meetings with up to 50 people in the chamber, while the remainder will participate digitally. This arrangement has been put in place to ensure social distancing measures are adhered to within the Houses of Parliament. However, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, has called for all Commons debates to be conducted digitally to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. The party's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, urging him to take this step. In her letter, she highlighted the potential risks of MPs travelling to and from Westminster, particularly those who have to use public transport. She pointed out that there have been confirmed cases of coronavirus among MPs and their staff in recent weeks. Saville Roberts argued that digital debates would be a safer and more accessible alternative. She cited examples of other parliaments and assemblies that have successfully transitioned to digital proceedings, including the Irish and Scottish parliaments. She also highlighted the benefits of digital debates, such as increased accessibility for those who are unable to attend in person, and the potential for more efficient and productive debates. The call for digital debates was backed by other opposition parties, including the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. Shadow Leader of the House, Thangam Debbonaire, confirmed that Labour would be pressing for digital debates to be made a permanent feature of the House of Commons, even after the pandemic has passed. However, the government has so far resisted calls for all debates to be conducted digitally. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that the government was ""confident that the hybrid arrangements we have put in place will allow Parliament to function effectively and safely"". They added that the government was ""continually reviewing the arrangements to ensure they are working as intended"". Despite this, the call for digital debates is likely to gain momentum, particularly as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in the UK. With the potential for a second wave of the virus, it is likely that digital debates will become an increasingly attractive option for MPs and political parties alike. Whether or not the government will eventually bow to the pressure remains to be seen, but one thing is clear - the coronavirus pandemic has forced the House of Commons to adapt in ways that were previously unimaginable, and digital debates are set to be a key part of that adaptation. In recent days, we have seen the Prime Minister and other senior politicians deliver statements to the House of Commons remotely, using video link technology. This marks a significant shift from the traditional way of doing things, and it is likely that digital debates will become a permanent feature of the House of Commons, even after the pandemic has passed.

Covid-19: Milton Keynes Hospital wedding couple reunite at home,"Elizabeth Kerr, 31, and Simon O'Brien, 36, found love in the most unexpected of places â a hospital ward in Milton Keynes. Both were admitted to Milton Keynes University Hospital with breathing difficulties on 9 January, amidst the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Their paths crossed when they were moved to the same ward, and they quickly discovered they had much in common. As they lay in their beds, weak and exhausted from their battles with the virus, they found solace in each other's company. Long conversations turned into laughter, and before they knew it, they had fallen in love. The hospital staff, who had watched their bond grow stronger each day, decided to do something special for the couple. When Elizabeth and Simon's conditions began to improve, the hospital arranged a small, socially distanced wedding ceremony in the hospital chapel. The staff went above and beyond to make the day special, decorating the chapel with flowers and balloons, and even arranging for a small reception in the hospital's courtyard. The couple exchanged vows in front of a small gathering of nurses and doctors, who had become like family to them. But as the days passed, it became clear that they couldn't stay in the hospital forever. With Elizabeth and Simon's conditions stabilised, they were both discharged from the hospital and sent home to recover. They were heartbroken to leave their new friends behind, but they knew they had each other. The couple settled into their new life together, grateful for the second chance they had been given. They were determined to make the most of every moment, and to never take their health or each other for granted again. But they couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. As they sat in their living room, watching the sunset over their new home, they couldn't help but miss the warmth and kindness of the hospital staff. They knew that they could never truly thank them enough for all they had done. But then, an idea struck Elizabeth. She picked up the phone and called the hospital. She explained their situation and asked if there was anything they could do to bring a little bit of the hospital's magic into their home. To their surprise, the hospital staff were more than happy to oblige. They arranged for a bouquet of flowers to be delivered to the couple's doorstep, along with a get-well card signed by all the nurses and doctors who had been a part of their wedding day. Elizabeth and Simon were touched by the gesture, and it brought a smile to their faces as they realised that their hospital family was still with them, even if they were no longer in the same building. And as they sat together on their couch, holding hands and watching the sunset, they knew that they had truly found something special â a love that had blossomed in the most unexpected of places.

""I am truly honored to be recognized with this prestigious award,"" Dame Evelyn said in a statement. ""Music has always been my passion and my driving force, and to be celebrated in this way is an indescribable feeling."" Born in Scotland in 1965, Dame Evelyn began playing the drums at the age of six and went on to study percussion at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She lost her hearing in her teens but refused to let it define her or hinder her career. Instead, she developed a unique approach to music, using her body to feel the vibrations of the instruments and the room around her. ""Music is not just about hearing, it's about feeling,"" she once said. ""And I feel music in a very profound way."" Dame Evelyn's innovative approach to percussion has earned her numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2002, which she was later promoted to Dame Commander (DBE) in 2012. She has performed with some of the world's greatest musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma, Kronos Quartet, and Sting. Joining Dame Evelyn as a recipient of the Polar Music Prize is the iconic American singer-songwriter Emmylou Harris. Harris, who has sold more than 40 million records worldwide, has been a trailblazer in country music since the 1970s. She has collaborated with artists such as Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton, and has won 13 Grammy Awards.

Anne Frank's diary removed from website,"The site briefly hosted a digital copy of Het Achterhuis, the first version of Anne Frank's diary compiled by her father Otto, which was published in 1947. It had been put online in the belief that the copyright had expired, but this was incorrect. Anne Frank's diary, a poignant and powerful record of the experiences of a young girl and her family during the Holocaust, was removed from a website after legal action was taken against the hosting platform. The diary, which was discovered in a sealed attic in 1945, has been published in numerous languages and has touched the hearts of millions of people around the world. The website in question, which is not being named in this report, had made the digital copy of the diary available to download for free. The decision to do so was based on the belief that the copyright on the work had expired. However, Anne Frank House, the organisation that holds the copyright to Anne Frank's diary, disputed this and took legal action against the website. Anne Frank House issued a statement saying, ""We were surprised and disappointed to find that the first version of Anne Frank's diary, which is under copyright, had been made available for download on a website. We take the protection of Anne Frank's copyright very seriously and will always take action against unauthorised use of her work."" The website in question has since removed the digital copy of the diary from their site and issued an apology for any inconvenience caused. They stated that they had made the decision to host the diary in good faith, based on information they had received about the copyright status. Anne Frank's diary is an important historical document and a powerful reminder of the human cost of war and persecution. It is essential that it is protected and respected, and that its copyright is upheld. Anne Frank House continues to work to ensure that Anne's story is shared with future generations, and that her legacy is preserved for years to come. The removal of the digital copy of the diary from the website is a reminder of the importance of respecting intellectual property rights and the need for accurate information about copyright status. It is also a reminder of the enduring power of Anne Frank's words to inspire and move people, and of the importance of preserving her story for future generations.

"Guides oath change consultation gets 30,000 responses","By Judith Burns, BBC News education reporter Guides currently pledge ""I will do my best, to love my God, to serve my Queen, to help other people, and to keep the Guiding Law."" But now, the Girls' Brigade and The Senior Section of Guiding UK, which together form Girlguiding, have launched a consultation on changing the Guides' promise. The proposed new oath reads: ""I promise that I will do my best, to be true to myself and developing my relationships with others, to respect myself and the world around me, to care for others and make a positive difference."" The consultation, which closes on 31st October, has already received over 30,000 responses. Girlguiding's CEO, Sharon Jollow, said: ""We're delighted with the response we've had so far. It's important that our promise reflects the values and beliefs of girls and young women today."" The proposed changes have been met with both support and criticism. Some argue that the new promise is more inclusive and reflects modern values, while others feel it moves away from the traditional Guiding ethos. One respondent wrote: ""I think the new promise is a step in the right direction. It's important that Guiding remains relevant to girls today, and this promise does that."" Another respondent, however, expressed concerns: ""I'm worried that this new promise takes away the religious aspect of Guiding. I think it's an important part of the organisation's history and identity."" Girlguiding has stressed that the new promise does not remove any religious elements, and that girls will still be able to make their promise in a way that aligns with their beliefs. The consultation is not just about the promise itself, but also about how it is delivered. Girlguiding is exploring different ways that the promise can be made, such as through a spoken word video or a signed promise. The consultation comes as Girlguiding celebrates its centenary year. The organisation was founded in 1914 with the aim of providing opportunities for girls to develop new skills and to ""be prepared"" for life. Over the past 100 years, Guiding has evolved to reflect changing societal values and to meet the needs of girls and young women. The consultation on the promise is just the latest example of this ongoing process of adaptation. Sharon Jollow said: ""We believe that this new promise will help us to continue to inspire and challenge girls and young women to reach their full potential."" Whether or not the new promise is ultimately adopted, one thing is clear: Guiding will continue to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of girls and young women in the 21st century.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
UK retail sales stall in April,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that UK retail sales remained relatively unchanged in April, with a flat month-on-month comparison to March. This figure was surprisingly better than the 0.3% decrease that economists had anticipated. The unexpected stability in retail sales came as a relief after a string of lacklustre performances in the sector. Despite the stagnant sales growth in April, the three-month period from February to April showed a more robust picture. Retail sales increased by 1.8% during this timeframe, marking a solid improvement compared to the 0.2% gain recorded in the previous three months. This acceleration was driven by robust growth in the food sector, which expanded by 3.3% compared to the previous quarter. Non-food stores, however, experienced a more subdued increase, with a growth rate of only 0.2% in the three months to April. The record growth in food sales can be attributed to a number of factors. The Easter holiday, which fell in April this year, likely boosted sales of food and beverages as families and friends gathered for celebrations. Additionally, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to a shift in consumer spending towards essential items, such as groceries, which have seen steady demand throughout the crisis. On a more negative note, the ONS data also highlighted that online sales continued to decline, shrinking by 4.8% in April compared to the previous month. This marks a reversal of the trend seen during the pandemic, where online sales surged as consumers turned to e-commerce to avoid physical stores. However, with the gradual reopening of the economy and the easing of lockdown restrictions, high-street retailers may be able to regain some lost ground. Another silver lining in the retail sales data was the continued growth in sales for non-store retailers, which include mail-order and online businesses that do not have a physical store presence. Sales in this sector grew by 2.2% in the three months to April, demonstrating that the shift towards online shopping is far from over. Despite the mixed signals from the retail sales data, there are some reasons for optimism. The stabilisation of sales in April, coupled with the strong growth in the food sector, suggests that the UK economy may be able to weather the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. However, the ongoing decline in online sales and the uncertain outlook for non-food stores underscore the need for continued support for the retail sector as it navigates the road to recovery.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Paul Cleeland: âNon-disclosureâ claim over 1972 murder,"By Tanya Gupta, BBC News Paul Cleeland has made a fresh request to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to revisit his case. He is currently serving life in prison for the murder of 19-year-old Linda Byrne in 1972. The latest application, his fourth, comes after new evidence emerged that could potentially challenge the conviction. Cleeland, now 72, has maintained his innocence since his arrest in 1973. He has always claimed that he was framed for the crime, which took place in the West Midlands town of Coventry. In recent years, he has gained support from various campaign groups who believe in his innocence and have taken up his cause. The new evidence includes statements from two witnesses who claimed they saw someone else at the scene of the crime. One of the witnesses, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed they saw a man matching the description of a suspect who was never identified by the police. The other witness, who has since passed away, gave a statement to the police at the time but was not called as a witness during Cleeland's trial. Cleeland's legal team, led by barrister Michael Mansfield QC, also plans to challenge the reliability of the main prosecution witness. The witness, who was a teenager at the time, has since recanted her testimony, stating that she was pressured by the police to give false evidence. The CCRC will now consider whether this new evidence warrants a review of Cleeland's case. If they decide to grant a review, it could lead to a new investigation or even a retrial. However, it is important to note that the CCRC only considers cases where there is new and compelling evidence that was not available at the time of the original trial. Cleeland's case has attracted widespread attention in recent years due to concerns about wrongful convictions in the UK justice system. The campaign group, the Miscarriage of Justice Organisation, has been lobbying for his release and has launched a petition with over 30,000 signatures. In a statement, Cleeland's legal team said, ""We are confident that the CCRC will recognise the importance of this new evidence and grant a review of the case. Paul Cleeland has suffered a miscarriage of justice and it is our duty to ensure that he receives a fair hearing and the opportunity to clear his name."" The CCRC has not yet announced when it will make a decision on the application. In the meantime, Cleeland remains in prison, continuing to maintain his innocence and hoping for a day when he can finally prove it. The case of Paul Cleeland raises important questions about the reliability of witness statements and the potential for wrongful convictions. It also underscores the need for continued vigilance and investigation into potential miscarriages of justice. Only",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
New name plan in Welsh ambulance shake-up,"A consultation document revealed on Monday proposes the establishment of a new NHS trust to oversee ambulance services in Wales, with the suggested name being the Welsh Emergency and Clinical Services NHS Trust. This change comes following a comprehensive review of the current structure and operations of the ambulance service in the country, which was conducted earlier this year. The health minister, Eluned Morgan, expressed her belief that the new name better reflects the comprehensive nature of the services the trust will provide. Morgan stated, ""The proposed name for the new trust is a clear reflection of the wide range of emergency and clinical services it will deliver. It also emphasizes the strong links between these services and the NHS."" The consultation document, which is open for public comment until February 2023, outlines the proposed structure and functions of the new trust. This includes the transfer of ambulance services from the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust to the new entity, as well as the potential integration of other emergency and clinical services, such as the Welsh Air Ambulance and the Welsh Blood Transfusion Service. The review, led by former Wales Ambulance Services NHS Trust chief executive Jason Killens, found that a more integrated approach to emergency and clinical services could lead to improved patient outcomes and increased efficiency. The proposed new trust aims to facilitate this integration, ultimately creating a more effective and coordinated response to emergencies in Wales. The consultation document also addresses concerns regarding the potential impact of the restructuring on staffing and employment. It assures that all current staff will be transferred to the new trust and that their terms and conditions will remain unchanged. Additionally, the document outlines a commitment to ongoing engagement and consultation with staff and their representatives throughout the transition process. Morgan emphasized the importance of the public's feedback during the consultation period, stating, ""We encourage everyone with an interest in these services to engage with the consultation and share their views. Your feedback will help us shape the new trust and ensure that it is well-positioned to deliver the best possible care to the people of Wales."" The proposed new trust is expected to come into being on April 1, 2023, subject to the necessary legislative and regulatory approvals.

Man 'distraught' amid hospital death payout,"By Michele Paduano, BBC Midlands health correspondent Laura Elwell had been looking forward to celebrating her 50th birthday with her family when she was admitted to Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital in October 2014.But her world was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The sepsis patient's condition quickly deteriorated, and she was soon moved to the intensive care unit. Her husband, John, remained by her side throughout her three-week stay in hospital. He watched in despair as doctors battled to save his wife, who was hooked up to various machines and tubes. Eventually, Laura pulled through, but her recovery was far from over. She was left with a range of health problems, including chronic pain and diabetes. The Elwells were determined to get answers about what had happened to Laura during her time in hospital. They were devastated to learn that an internal report had claimed there had been ""staggering"" failures in her care. The couple were not alone in their distress. The same report revealed that at least 40 other patients had died as a result of similar failings at New Cross Hospital between 2010 and 2013. The Elwells were entitled to make a claim for compensation under the NHS Resolution's Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts. But the process was long and arduous, and the couple were left feeling overwhelmed and distraught. John explained: ""We just wanted answers and closure. But the whole process was so drawn out and stressful. We were given no information about what was happening or when we might receive a response."" The family were eventually awarded a five-figure sum in damages, but they felt it did not come close to reflecting the trauma and suffering they had endured. John added: ""The money can't bring Laura back to how she was before she fell ill, or erase the memories of what we went through. It's just a small acknowledgement of the harm that was caused."" Wolverhampton Clinical Commissioning Group, which oversees healthcare services in the area, admitted that improvements needed to be made in the way complaints were handled and communicated to families. A spokesperson said: ""We are deeply sorry for the distress caused to the Elwell family and recognise that there are lessons to be learned from their experience. We are committed to working with them to ensure that similar situations do not occur in the future."" The NHS Resolution, which manages clinical negligence claims against the NHS in England, said it was unable to comment on individual cases. But it emphasised that the process for making a claim was designed to be fair, transparent, and efficient.

Millicent Fawcett to be first woman statue in Parliament Square,"The equal rights campaigner who dedicated her life to getting the women's vote, Millicent Fawcett, will soon stand alongside great historical figures such as Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, made the announcement during a ceremony marking the centenary of some women gaining the right to vote in the UK. Born in 1847, Fawcett was a pioneering figure in the fight for women's suffrage. She founded the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), also known as the Suffragette Movement, in 1897. The organisation took a peaceful approach to achieving suffrage, focusing on lobbying and petitioning the government. Fawcett and her supporters, known as 'suffragettes', wore purple, white, and green â symbols of loyalty, purity, and hope â and held public meetings and processions to raise awareness of their cause. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, including being arrested multiple times and subjected to abuse and ridicule, Fawcett never wavered in her determination. She continued to campaign tirelessly, believing that women deserved the same rights and opportunities as men. Her efforts paid off when, on February 6, 1918, the Representation of the People Act was passed, granting some women the right to vote for the first time. However, Fawcett knew that the battle was not yet won. Women still did not have the same voting rights as men, and it was not until ten years later, on July 2, 1928, that the Equal Franchise Act was passed, giving women the same voting rights as men. Fawcett's tireless work had finally paid off, and she had achieved what many thought was impossible. Now, over 90 years after her death, Fawcett will be recognised with a statue in Parliament Square. The announcement drew praise from many, who saw it as a fitting tribute to a woman who had devoted her life to securing the fundamental right to vote for women. Theresa May described Fawcett as ""a champion of equality, a pioneer, and a trailblazer,"" adding that her statue would serve as a reminder of the ""incredible legacy"" she left behind. The statue, which is being funded by a crowdfunding campaign, is expected to be unveiled in 2022, the centenary of women's suffrage in the UK. It will join the ranks of other notable figures in Parliament Square, including Sir Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi. Fawcett's statue will stand as a testament to her incredible achievements and her unwavering commitment to women's rights.

NÃ³ra Quoirin: 'Compelling evidence' of abduction,"NÃ³ra Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast, disappeared from her room at the Dusun resort in Malaysia on 4 August 2019. Her body was found 10 days later, about 1.6 miles (2.5km) away in the dense jungle surrounding the resort. The discovery of her remains brought an end to a harrowing search that captivated the world. Earlier this month, the Malaysian police announced that they had ""compelling evidence"" that NÃ³ra had been abducted from her resort room. The police chief, Comm Datuk Seri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, did not elaborate on the nature of this evidence but said that it had been obtained through ""forensic investigation and eye-witness accounts."" The Quoirin family, who were on holiday in Malaysia, had arrived at the Dusun resort on 27 July. NÃ³ra, who had learning difficulties and was prone to wandering, had been missing for several hours on the morning of 4 August before her absence was reported to the authorities. The resort, located in the Batang Kali district of Selangor state, is situated on a hillside amongst lush greenery and is popular with tourists. The search for NÃ³ra involved hundreds of volunteers, including the Malaysian police, military personnel, and members of the local community. The discovery of NÃ³ra's body was a tragic end to a search that had brought hope to many. The news was met with shock and disbelief by NÃ³ra's family and friends, who had remained hopeful that she would be found alive. The Malaysian police have since arrested a local man in connection with NÃ³ra's disappearance. The man, who is in his 20s, was detained on 16 August and is currently being held for questioning. The police have not released any further details about the arrest or the man's involvement in the case. The Quoirin family, who have returned to the UK, have released a statement expressing their gratitude for the support they have received during their ordeal. They have also asked for privacy as they come to terms with their loss. The investigation into NÃ³ra's disappearance and death is ongoing, and the Malaysian authorities are continuing to appeal for information from the public. The case has raised concerns about the safety of tourists in Malaysia and the need for greater security measures at resorts and tourist attractions. The disappearance and death of NÃ³ra Quoirin is a tragic reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of keeping our loved ones safe.

Parkinson's skin-swab test 'in sight',"Studies with volunteers have shown that a Parkinson's skin-swab test, which involves collecting samples of sebum, the oily substance that protects the skin, can quickly detect tell-tale compounds associated with the condition. This non-invasive method could potentially revolutionize the way Parkinson's disease is diagnosed, offering an alternative to the current time-consuming and expensive methods. The test is based on the discovery that people with Parkinson's disease have higher levels of certain organic compounds in their sebum. These compounds, known as skatin-9 and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), are produced when the brain begins to breakdown a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is crucial for regulating movement and coordination, and its depletion is a key feature of Parkinson's disease. In a recent clinical trial, researchers collected sebum samples from both Parkinson's disease patients and healthy individuals using sterile, adhesive swabs. The samples were then analyzed using a technique called gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which separates and identifies individual components in a complex mixture. The results showed that the Parkinson's disease patients had significantly higher levels of skatin-9 and MPP+ in their sebum compared to the healthy individuals. This breakthrough has the potential to streamline the diagnostic process for Parkinson's disease. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing Parkinson's disease is a combination of clinical examinations, which can take several hours, and imaging tests, which can be expensive and sometimes inconvenient for patients. A simple skin-swab test could make the process quicker, more accessible, and more cost-effective. Further research is needed to validate the accuracy and reliability of the Parkinson's skin-swab test. Scientists are also exploring the possibility of using this test as a biomarker to monitor the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments. The potential applications of this test extend beyond diagnostics and could provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, a Parkinson's skin-swab test that can quickly detect tell-tale compounds in sebum offers a promising alternative to the current diagnostic methods. With further research, this non-invasive test could streamline the diagnostic process, making it more accessible and cost-effective for patients. It could also provide valuable insights into the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments. The future of Parkinson's disease diagnosis may well be in the palm of our hands.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Waspi campaign: The fight against changes to women's state pension age,"By Reality Check team, BBC News That effort goes back decades, so to help understand the issue here is some background. How did we get here? From 1948 for more than 70 years, the state pension age for women in the UK was lower than that for men. This was a legacy of a time when women were expected to leave the workforce to raise families. In the late 1990s, the government announced plans to equalise the state pension age for men and women. The process was to be phased in gradually, but it has caused controversy and hardship for many women. The Pensions Act of 1995 set out a timetable for raising the state pension age for women to be the same as men by 2025. The changes were due to begin in 2010, but they were brought forward to 2005 for men and 2011 for women. The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign, which was launched in 2011, argues that women born in the 1950s were not given sufficient notice of the changes. Many of these women had planned their retirements based on the previous retirement age and were not given enough time to adjust. The Waspi campaign estimates that around 3.8 million women are affected by these changes, which mean they will have to wait longer for their state pension than they had anticipated. Some women have been left in financial hardship as a result. The government has argued that the changes were necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the state pension system. It has also pointed out that it has provided transitional arrangements to help affected women, such as increasing the state pension by Â£8.40 a week for those reached state pension age between 60 and 65. However, the Waspi campaign argues that these arrangements do not go far enough. They argue that the government should provide more generous transitional arrangements or compensate affected women for the financial losses they have incurred. The issue is complex and contentious, with strong feelings on both sides. The Waspi campaign has attracted widespread support, and there have been protests and rallies across the UK. The government has faced calls to reconsider its position and provide more generous transitional arrangements. The Waspi campaign is not just about the past, but also about the future. With the state pension age continuing to rise, it is important that future generations are given adequate notice of the changes. The Waspi campaign is calling for the government to provide clear and effective communication about future pension age changes, to help prevent similar hardships from occurring again. The Waspi campaign is a reminder of the need for transparency and fairness in the way that pension age changes are implemented. It is a reminder that the pension system is not just a dry statistical issue, but something that affects the lives of",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Fifth of UK women decline cervical smear tests,"Despite the proven effectiveness of cervical smear tests in the early detection and prevention of cervical cancer, approximately half of all women in the UK are declining the invitation to undergo the procedure, according to the latest statistics from Public Health England. Early detection through screening, followed by treatment, can prevent up to 75% of these cancers developing. Yet despite high-profile cases such as that of Jade Goody, who died of the disease two years ago, many women still choose to ignore the invitation to attend for their regular screening. The reasons for this trend are complex and multifaceted. Some women report feeling anxious or embarrassed about the test itself, which involves a healthcare professional taking a sample of cells from the cervix for examination. Others may feel that they are too busy or that they are not at risk of developing the disease. However, it is important to remember that cervical cancer can affect women of all ages and backgrounds, and that regular screening is crucial in identifying any abnormalities before they become more serious. In fact, the majority of cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in women under the age of 50. The NHS offers cervical screening free of charge to all women between the ages of 25 and 64. Women under 25 are also invited for screening if they have abnormal results from previous tests or if they have certain risk factors, such as a history of cervical abnormalities or a weakened immune system. Despite the benefits of regular screening, many women still choose to decline the invitation. This is especially concerning given that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancer. In fact, if all eligible women underwent regular screening, thousands of cases could be prevented each year. So, what can be done to encourage more women to attend for their cervical smear tests? One approach is to raise awareness of the importance of screening and to dispel common myths and misconceptions about the procedure. This can be done through public health campaigns, school education programs, and community outreach initiatives. Another approach is to make the screening process more convenient and accessible. This could include offering more flexible appointment times, providing home testing kits, or setting up mobile screening units in community centers and other easily accessible locations. Ultimately, it is up to each individual woman to take responsibility for her own health and to attend for regular cervical screening. By doing so, she not only reduces her own risk of developing cervical cancer but also helps to prevent the spread of this disease in the wider community. So if you have received an invitation to attend for your cervical smear test, please don't delay. Make an appointment and take the first step towards protecting your health.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid-19: Northamptonshire was 'hair's breadth' from tier 3,"The county will remain under tier two rules, as it has been since England's second national lockdown ended. Lucy Wightman, director of Public Health Northamptonshire, made the announcement on Tuesday, urging residents to remain ""vigilant"" in their efforts to control the spread of Covid-19. Addressing a virtual press conference, Wightman said: ""I want to be clear that we have made it through this tier review period, but it was a close call. Northamptonshire was very much in the 'hair's breadth' of moving into tier three. I cannot stress enough the importance of following the rules and taking personal responsibility for your actions."" The county had seen a significant increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, prompting fears that it could be moved into the more restrictive tier three. According to Public Health England data, Northamptonshire recorded 1,253 new cases in the week ending October 24, an increase of 26 percent compared to the previous week. Wightman said: ""We have seen a rise in cases, particularly in younger people. I urge everyone to continue to follow the guidance, to wear masks, to maintain social distancing, and to avoid socialising in large groups. We are still in the middle of a global pandemic, and it is up to each and every one of us to do our part to keep ourselves, our families, and our communities safe."" The director of public health also encouraged residents to get tested if they develop any symptoms of Covid-19. She said: ""Testing is crucial in helping us to identify cases and prevent further transmission. I would urge anyone who has symptoms to book a test as soon as possible. I would also encourage anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive to get a test, even if they don't have symptoms."" Wightman praised the efforts of local businesses and community organisations in implementing Covid-secure measures. She said: ""I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard to make Northamptonshire a safe place to live and work. Your efforts have made a real difference, and we cannot afford to let up now."" Looking ahead, Wightman said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will not hesitate to take action if necessary. I would urge everyone to remain vigilant and to follow the rules. We are in this together, and we will get through this together."" The government's Covid-19 review for Northamptonshire, which was due to be published on Thursday, had been brought forward following the sharp rise in cases. The decision to keep Northamptonshire in tier two means that pubs and restaurants can continue to serve customers indoors, with certain restrictions in place, and that households can mix indoors with up to six people from two households. However, Wightman warned that the situation could change quickly, and that residents must remain cautious. She",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Norfolk and Waveney mental health: Dissatisfaction with care,"The Norfolk and Waveney Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) survey revealing that 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with how to access mental health services has sparked criticism from a patients' group. The findings, which were based on responses from over 1,200 people, underscore growing concerns about the accessibility and effectiveness of mental health care in the region. The survey, which was commissioned to gather feedback on mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney, also highlighted that 60% of those who did know how to access services had waited more than a week for their first appointment. This wait time, according to the patients' group, is unacceptable and contributes to a sense of frustration and despair among those seeking help. The group, which represents the interests of mental health service users in the area, has called on the STP to take immediate action to address these issues. In a statement, the group's chair said, ""We have long been raising concerns about the accessibility and quality of mental health services in Norfolk and Waveney. These survey results confirm our fears and demonstrate a clear need for change."" The group went on to highlight the impact that long wait times and a lack of knowledge about how to access services can have on individuals and their families. ""Mental health issues can be debilitating, and the longer someone has to wait for help, the worse their condition can become. It's essential that the STP takes steps to ensure that people are able to access the care they need as soon as possible,"" the chair added. The STP has acknowledged the concerns raised by the patients' group and has pledged to take action to address the issues highlighted in the survey. In a statement, a spokesperson for the STP said, ""We understand the frustration and anxiety that long wait times for mental health services can cause. We are committed to improving access to services and reducing wait times wherever possible."" The spokesperson went on to outline some of the steps that the STP is taking to address these issues, including the recruitment of more mental health professionals and the expansion of telehealth services. However, the patients' group has called on the STP to do more, including increasing funding for mental health services and engaging more closely with service users to better understand their needs. As the debate continues about how best to improve mental health care in Norfolk and Waveney, one thing is clear: action is urgently needed to address the issues raised in the survey and to ensure that those in need are able to access the care and support they require in a timely and effective manner.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Scotland weather: More gales hit parts of Scotland,"As the sun sets on another day in Scotland, the country braces itself for yet another bout of severe weather. High winds battering the coast are expected to ease as an area of low pressure continues to move across northern parts of the country. The Met Office has issued multiple flood alerts for various regions, including Aberdeenshire, Angus, and Perth and Kinross, as heavy rainfall is set to cause flooding in low-lying areas. The stormy conditions come just days after the country was hit by hurricane-force winds, with gusts reaching up to 90mph in some areas. The impact of the storm was felt across various industries, with transport links disrupted and power outages reported in several regions. The RNLI has urged caution for those living near the coast, urging them to stay away from the shoreline as large waves continue to crash against the shore. The organisation has also reminded boat owners to secure their vessels, with many already damaged or destroyed during the recent storms. Farmers in the affected areas have also expressed their concerns, with crops and livestock at risk from the heavy rainfall and strong winds. The National Farmers Union Scotland has called on the government to provide support to those impacted by the weather, with some farmers reporting significant losses. However, there is some respite in sight as the Met Office predicts that the weather is set to improve by the end of the week. Temperatures are expected to rise, and there are hopes that the country may even see some sunshine. Despite the challenges presented by the weather, the Scottish spirit remains unbroken. Communities have come together to support one another during the difficult conditions, with many offering assistance to those in need. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has urged people to stay informed of the latest weather updates and to take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property. The organisation has also reminded people to avoid walking or driving through floodwater, as it can be dangerous and potentially fatal.

Celebrity Big Brother responds to Stormy Daniels no-show,"The adult film star, Stormy Daniels, was expected to be one of the most intriguing housemates in this series of Celebrity Big Brother, which kicked off on Thursday night. However, her anticipated entrance into the house never materialized, leaving viewers and producers alike in a state of confusion. Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, made the announcement of her withdrawal from the reality show just hours before the live launch. In a statement, he accused the producers of trying to ""script a result"" and manipulate the situation for their own gain. Avenatti's statement read, ""This afternoon, I received a call from a representative of CBS requesting that Ms. Daniels appear on the Friday night episode of Big Brother and that she be asked to participate in a 'surprise' entrance. I informed them that she would NOT be participating, under any circumstances. I'm now being told that they 'didn't actually ask for her' but rather 'wanted her to ask for them.' I want to make clear that at no time was Ms. Daniels asked or invited to participate in the show."" The representative from CBS responded by stating that they had indeed extended an invitation to Daniels, but she had not accepted it. They also denied any allegations of attempting to manipulate the situation or 'script a result.' In the absence of Daniels, speculation about her reasons for pulling out ran rampant. Some suggested that it could be due to the intense media scrutiny surrounding her involvement in the Stormy Daniels scandal with President Trump. Others believed that it could be a strategic move to keep the spotlight on her, given the higher profile that comes with being a houseguest on Big Brother. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Daniels' absence, the show went on as planned. The remaining housemates, which included celebrities such as Kirstie Alley, Tana Mongeau, and Ryan Lochte, were introduced to the audience and began their journey in the Big Brother house. Celebrity Big Brother producer, Allison Grodner, released a statement expressing disappointment over Daniels' withdrawal but reassuring viewers that the show would go on without her. ""We were excited to have Stormy Daniels as a houseguest this season, but we cannot comment on why she chose not to enter the house. We're looking forward to the season and the unexpected twists and turns that always come with Celebrity Big Brother."" As the show progressed, the housemates settled into their roles, forming alliances and engaging in drama. The absence of Stormy Daniels was a topic of conversation, with some housemates expressing disappointment and others expressing relief. Whether or not Daniels' departure had an impact on the outcome of the show remains to be seen.

"Australian political parties hit by 'state actor' hack, PM says","The cyber-attack revealed two weeks ago on Australian political parties has caused significant concern, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirming that the intrusion was carried out by a ""sophisticated state actor"". But he added that there was ""no evidence of any electoral interference"" in the upcoming national elections, scheduled to take place on May 21. The Prime Minister made these statements during a press conference on Thursday, expressing confidence in the country's cybersecurity measures and the integrity of the electoral process. He also assured the public that the Australian Federal Police and Australian Cyber Security Centre were actively investigating the incident, working to identify the perpetrators and the extent of the breach. The affected political parties include the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party, and the National Party, with reports suggesting that the hackers gained unauthorized access to their computer networks, potentially compromising sensitive information. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called for a swift and thorough investigation, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in the aftermath of the attack. The cyber-attack has raised concerns about the security of Australia's democratic institutions, with some experts warning of the potential for foreign interference in the upcoming elections. Morrison, however, sought to reassure the public that there was no evidence of any tampering with electoral data or systems. He also emphasized that Australia had strong partnerships with its international allies, collaborating on cybersecurity issues and sharing intelligence to protect against potential threats. The cyber-attack is not the first incident of its kind in Australia, with the country experiencing a number of high-profile hacks in recent years. In 2016, the Australian Bureau of Statistics was targeted during the census, while the Australian Defence Force was targeted in 2019. These incidents have underscored the need for continued investment in cybersecurity, with Morrison committing $1.35 billion over the next decade to strengthen the country's cyber defenses. Despite the assurances from the Prime Minister, the cyber-attack has cast a shadow over the upcoming elections, with some commentators suggesting that it could erode public trust in the democratic process. The opposition has called for a full and transparent investigation, with Albanese urging Morrison to establish an independent inquiry into the incident. The public will be closely watching developments in the coming days as the investigation continues and the election draws near. In the meantime, political parties and other organizations have been urged to take steps to secure their digital infrastructure, with the Australian Cyber Security Centre providing guidance on best practices for cybersecurity. The incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by cyber-attacks and the need for continued vigilance and investment in cybersecurity.

Home ownership 'overestimated by official data',"The official estimate of a 64% home ownership rate in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), was too high, the Resolution Foundation said in a new report. The think tank, which conducts research and policy analysis to improve living standards for the UK's lower and middle income households, warned that the ONS data did not adequately reflect the true extent of homeownership in the country. The Resolution Foundation highlighted that many people who owned their homes also shared them with others, such as adult children or lodgers, which was not taken into account in the official statistics. The think tank's analysis of the English Housing Survey data showed that, when accounting for these co-resident adults, the homeownership rate dropped to around 60%. Furthermore, the Resolution Foundation criticized the ONS for focusing solely on household level data, rather than individual level data. This approach meant that it was difficult to accurately assess the homeownership rate for different demographic groups, particularly those who were more likely to share homes. The report also emphasized the importance of understanding the true extent of homeownership, as it has significant implications for public policy. For example, the government's housing strategy is based on the belief that homeownership is the best route to wealth accumulation and financial security. However, if the homeownership rate is overestimated, this could lead to misguided policy priorities and a failure to address the needs of those who are renting or struggling to afford a home. The Resolution Foundation called on the ONS to revise its methodology to better reflect the true extent of homeownership in the UK. This could include collecting more detailed data on co-resident adults and adopting a more nuanced approach to defining homeownership. The think tank also urged policymakers to consider alternative housing models, such as shared ownership or co-living, which could provide more affordable and flexible housing options for those who are unable or unwilling to buy a home outright. In conclusion, the Resolution Foundation's report highlighted the need for more accurate and nuanced data on homeownership in the UK. By recognizing the importance of co-resident adults and adopting a more individual-focused approach, policymakers can gain a more accurate understanding of the true extent of homeownership and develop more effective housing policies to meet the needs of all households.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Facebook buys virtual reality headset start-up for $2bn,"The start-up's flagship product, the Oculus Rift, is a goggle-like ""immersive"" headset for video gaming.

Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR is part of a larger trend in the tech industry towards virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. Google, Microsoft, and Samsung have also made significant investments in VR and AR, recognizing the potential of these technologies to transform industries and create new markets. However, the acquisition of Oculus VR by Facebook has raised some concerns among users and privacy advocates. Some have expressed concerns about the implications of Facebook's collection of vast amounts of personal data through its social media platform and the potential misuse of that data in a VR context. Despite these concerns, the acquisition is seen as a significant step forward for both Facebook and the VR industry. With its vast resources and reach, Facebook has the potential to bring VR technology to a mass audience and transform the way we interact with each other and the world around us. In conclusion, Facebook's $2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR is a bold and ambitious move that signals the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. The Oculus Rift's immersive gaming experience and potential applications in education, healthcare, and entertainment make it a valuable addition to Facebook's portfolio, and the acquisition is expected to have a significant impact on the tech industry and beyond.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Lorry drivers who drink coffee 'cut their crash risk',"By Michelle Roberts, Health editor, BBC News online Australian investigators have found that lorry drivers who drink coffee may be less likely to be involved in crashes. The researchers made the discovery while comparing 530 heavy goods vehicle drivers who had recently been in a crash with an equal number of drivers who had not been involved in an accident. The study, published in the journal Accident Analysis & Prevention, found that drivers who had consumed caffeine before getting behind the wheel were 12% less likely to be involved in a crash than those who had not. The protective effect was particularly noticeable among drivers who had not had enough sleep before driving. Lead researcher Dr. Shu Wen Ng of the Monash University Accident Research Centre in Melbourne, said: ""Our study highlights the importance of caffeine as a potential alertness-enhancing substance for drivers, particularly those who are sleep-deprived. However, it is essential to note that caffeine should not be seen as a substitute for good sleep."" The researchers analyzed data from the Australian Crash Involvement Survey, which gathers information from police reports, hospital records, and self-reported data from drivers involved in crashes. The data included information on the drivers' caffeine intake, hours of sleep, and other factors such as age, gender, and driving experience. The researchers found that 64% of the drivers involved in crashes had consumed caffeine before driving, compared with 68% of the drivers who had not been in a crash. However, when the researchers controlled for other factors, they found that the drivers who had consumed caffeine were less likely to be involved in a crash. The protective effect of caffeine was most pronounced among drivers who had slept for less than five hours in the 24 hours before driving. These drivers were 24% less likely to be involved in a crash if they had consumed caffeine. The researchers suggest that caffeine may help to improve alertness and attention in drivers, particularly those who are sleep-deprived. However, they caution that excessive caffeine consumption can have negative effects, such as increased heart rate and anxiety. The researchers also note that their study does not prove cause and effect, and that more research is needed to confirm the findings. They suggest that future studies could explore the optimal dosage and timing of caffeine intake for drivers. In the meantime, they advise drivers to prioritize getting enough sleep before driving and to consider other measures to improve alertness, such as taking regular breaks, avoiding long drives during peak hours, and ensuring that their vehicles are well-maintained. The study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that caffeine can have health benefits, particularly for those who are sleep-deprived.

Welcome to Yorkshire: Peer calls for board to resign,"The two Welcome to Yorkshire (WtY) reports, released earlier this week, have shed new light on the troubled past of the tourism organization. The reports revealed that expenses claims were made without receipts, and staff felt unable to speak out about bad behaviour. These findings have prompted calls for the current board to resign, with one peer leading the charge. Lord Crathorne, a Yorkshire peer and former WtY chairman, has expressed his disappointment and concern over the reports' contents. In a statement, he called for the current board to step down, stating that ""these allegations are extremely serious and require urgent action."" The reports, commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), detailed a culture of bullying and harassment within the organization, with some staff members alleging that they were subjected to verbal abuse and sexual harassment. Furthermore, the reports found that some board members had made expenses claims without providing receipts, with some of these claims totalling thousands of pounds. Lord Crathorne's call for the board's resignation has been supported by other figures within the Yorkshire community. Darren Swan, chief executive of the Yorkshire Tourist Board, said that he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the reports' findings, and that he believed it was time for a fresh start for WtY. ""The reports make for grim reading, and it's clear that change is needed,"" he said. The DCMS has announced that it will be launching an investigation into the matter, with a view to taking ""appropriate action"" once the findings have been reviewed. In the meantime, WtY has suspended its chief executive, Gary Verity, and its finance director, Andy Dearing, pending the outcome of the investigation. The reports have caused widespread shock and disbelief within the Yorkshire community, with many expressing their disappointment and anger at the allegations. Yorkshire County Council leader, Councillor Carl Les, said that he was ""absolutely appalled"" by the findings, and that he believed that WtY needed to ""learn from its mistakes and move forward."" As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what the future holds for WtY. However, one thing is clear: the organization's reputation has been seriously damaged, and it will take a considerable effort to restore public trust and confidence.

West Coast Main Line First Group deal put on hold,"Last week, Virgin launched a legal challenge after being unsuccessful in their bid to continue operating the West Coast Main Line (WCML) rail franchise. The announcement came as a surprise, as ministers were expected to sign the deal with FirstGroup, granting the company the rights to operate the line for the next 15 years. The WCML is one of the most important rail routes in the UK, connecting London to the northwest of England and Scotland. The franchise, which is worth around Â£5.5 billion, is highly sought after due to its strategic importance and the significant revenue it generates. Virgin's challenge hinges on the process by which the Department for Transport (DfT) awarded the franchise to FirstGroup. The company argues that the DfT failed to properly consider all the bids and that the decision-making process was biased. The DfT has denied these allegations, stating that the competition was fair and transparent, and that the decision was based on the best value for money for taxpayers. The legal challenge has put the deal on hold, leaving the future of the franchise uncertain. If Virgin is successful, it could lead to a lengthy and costly process to re-run the competition. Alternatively, FirstGroup could be awarded the franchise while the challenge is ongoing, only for it to be subject to potential legal action. The delay has caused frustration for passengers, who are uncertain about the future of the service and the potential for disruption. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, has called on the government to provide clarity as soon as possible. ""Passengers deserve certainty and clarity about their rail services and we urge the Department for Transport to resolve this situation as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group said. The situation is also causing uncertainty for the rail industry more broadly. The WCML franchise is just one of several major rail projects currently under consideration, and a lengthy legal challenge could set a precedent for future competitions. ""The rail industry is at a critical juncture and we need stability and certainty to invest in new trains, improve stations and expand services,"" said a spokesperson for the Rail Industry Association. The DfT has confirmed that it will continue to work with both Virgin and FirstGroup to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. In the meantime, passengers are being advised to check the National Rail Enquiries website for the latest information on their journeys. The outcome of the legal challenge could have significant implications for the rail industry and the wider transport sector. If Virgin is successful, it could lead to a re-run of the competition and a delay in the modernisation of the WCML.

Richard Wadani: Austrian Nazi deserter dies aged 97,"Richard Wadani, an Austrian native, was drafted into the German army during World War II but managed to escape its clutches on his second attempt in 1944. His decision to leave the German military was driven by his growing moral objections to the atrocities being committed in the name of the Third Reich. So began Wadani's remarkable journey from a German soldier to a British ally. Having made the perilous escape from the German army, Wadani found his way to Italy, where he surrendered to the Allied forces. Upon his capture, he was taken to a British-led prisoner of war camp, where he was held for several months. However, his language skills and knowledge of German military operations proved invaluable to the Allied forces. With the Allied forces' approval, Wadani was recruited as a spy and put to work infiltrating German lines. His ability to speak German fluently and his understanding of German military tactics made him an invaluable asset. Wadani's work as a double agent was instrumental in providing the Allies with vital intelligence, allowing them to plan successful attacks and avoid costly mistakes. Despite the risks involved, Wadani continued his work as a spy until the end of the war. His bravery and contributions to the Allied war effort were recognized with several awards, including the Military Medal and the Czechoslovak War Cross. After the war, Wadani returned to Austria, where he lived a quiet life as a farmer. He rarely spoke about his wartime experiences, preferring to keep his past hidden from the public. However, his legacy as a hero and a deserter from the Nazi regime lived on. In the decades that followed, Wadani's story became the subject of several books and documentaries. His bravery and determination to stand against the Nazi regime inspired many, and his story served as a powerful reminder of the human cost of war. Richard Wadani passed away on March 12, 2021, at the age of 97. His death marked the end of an era, but his legacy as a man who defied the Nazis and fought on the side of the Allies lived on. Wadani's story is one of courage, determination, and the human spirit's ability to overcome even the most difficult circumstances. Throughout his life, Wadani remained humble about his wartime exploits, preferring to focus on the present and the simple pleasures of farm life. However, his story continues to inspire generations, a testament to the power of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. In a world where politics and war continue to dominate the headlines, Richard Wadani's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, no matter the cost.

Marsden Moor fire: Crews at scene of mile-long blaze,"The fire on Marsden Moor near Black Moss Reservoir and Swellands Reservoir, a popular beauty spot in West Yorkshire, started at 19:00 BST on Sunday. Owned by the National Trust, the vast expanse of heather moorland, known for its rich biodiversity and scenic views, is now a scene of destruction. The trust has expressed its disappointment and concern over the incident, which has caused major damage and could have been avoided. According to the trust, the fire is estimated to be over a mile long and is still burning fiercely. Crews from the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, the National Trust, and other agencies are working tirelessly to contain the blaze, which is being fueled by the dry and windy conditions. Helicopters have been drafted in to drop water on the flames from above. The cause of the fire is not yet known, but the National Trust is urging visitors to be extra cautious when using barbecues, having campfires, or discarding cigarettes in the area. The trust also reminds people that open fires are not permitted on Marsden Moor and that disposable barbecues must be used in designated areas only. The Marsden Moor fire comes just a week after the devastating fire in the New Forest, which destroyed hundreds of acres of woodland and heathland. The National Trust and other conservation organizations have been urging the public to take extra care during the current heatwave to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The impact of the fire on Marsden Moor is not just environmental. The National Trust also runs a number of visitor facilities in the area, including the Marsden Moor Visitor Centre and the nearby Marsden Moor Estate, which are currently closed due to the fire.

Taj Mahal: mud-pack treatment for pollution stains,"The treatment is hoped to restore the natural sheen and colour of the white marble monument. It will be the fourth time in recent years that the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra, India, undergoes this mud-pack procedure to combat the growing issue of pollution stains. The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of love, has been battling the effects of pollution for decades. The monument, which was completed in 1653, has begun to show signs of yellowing and discoloration, with pollution stains becoming increasingly noticeable. The mud-pack treatment, also known as ""ghana pichha,"" is a traditional Indian method used to clean and restore the natural beauty of marble structures. The process involves covering the monument in a thick layer of mud, which is left to dry for several hours before being carefully removed. The mud used for the treatment is sourced from the nearby village of Maroth, which is known for its high-quality mud. The villagers collect the mud from the banks of the Yamuna River, which flows near their village, and dry it in the sun before it is ready for use. The treatment process begins early in the morning, with a team of skilled workers carefully applying the mud to the monument using soft brushes. The mud is applied in thick layers, starting from the bottom and working their way up. The team works methodically, ensuring that every inch of the monument is covered. Once the mud has dried, which can take several hours, it is carefully removed using water. The workers use long-handled brushes to gently scrub the mud off the surface of the monument. The process is repeated several times to ensure that all the mud is removed, leaving the marble surface cleaner and smoother than before. The mud-pack treatment is just one of the many measures being taken to protect the Taj Mahal from the effects of pollution. Other initiatives include the planting of trees to reduce air pollution, the use of solar panels to reduce the monument's carbon footprint, and the installation of a water filtration system to ensure that the monument's reflecting pools remain clean. Despite these efforts, the Taj Mahal continues to face significant challenges from pollution. The monument is located in a heavily industrialized area, with factories and transportation emissions contributing to the high levels of air pollution in the region. The Yamuna River, which flows nearby, is also heavily polluted, with industrial and domestic waste contributing to the problem. Despite these challenges, the mud-pack treatment is seen as an important step in preserving the natural beauty of the Taj Mahal. The treatment not only helps to remove pollution stains but also helps to protect the marble surface from further damage. It is a testament to the enduring love and commitment of the Indian people to preserve this iconic symbol of their rich cultural heritage.

Arctic walrus off Ireland's coast proves a rare sighting,"The rare sighting of an Arctic walrus off the coast of Ireland has left both local residents and wildlife experts in awe. The sighting was captured by a local man and his five-year-old daughter on Sunday, as they took a stroll along the beach in Co. Donegal. The man, who wished to remain anonymous, shared the news of their discovery with the local community, and soon enough, word spread like wildfire. People flocked to the area, hoping to catch a glimpse of this elusive and intriguing visitor. But by Monday, observers reported that the walrus was no longer in sight. The exact reason for its departure remains a mystery. Some speculate that it may have been driven away by other marine life or harsh weather conditions. Others believe that it may have simply swum back to its Arctic home. The Arctic walrus is a large, robust marine mammal that is well-adapted to living in the frigid Arctic waters. They are known to inhabit the Arctic Ocean, the Bering Sea, and the North Atlantic Ocean. However, they are rarely spotted in Irish waters, making this sighting a truly remarkable event. The Arctic walrus is an essential part of the Arctic food chain, and its absence can have far-reaching consequences. They feed primarily on clams, mussels, and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and their hunting behavior helps to keep these populations in check. The walrus also serves as a key prey species for polar bears, which rely on them for food during the winter months when other sources are scarce. The sighting of an Arctic walrus off the coast of Ireland is a reminder of the changing climate and the impacts it can have on our natural world. As global temperatures continue to rise, we can expect to see more unusual and unexpected sightings like this one. It also highlights the importance of protecting and preserving the Arctic and its unique ecosystems, which are under threat from human activities such as oil drilling, mining, and tourism. Despite its absence, the memory of the Arctic walrus off the coast of Ireland will linger on, a testament to the beauty and wonder of the natural world and the importance of cherishing and preserving it for future generations. Let us hope that this rare sighting will serve as a reminder to us all of the importance of protecting the Arctic and its inhabitants, and taking action to mitigate the impacts of climate change.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

GCSE computing tasks withdrawn after answers appear online,"By Judith Burns, Education reporter, BBC News The exam board OCR has confirmed that certain units within its GCSE Computing syllabus will be ""replaced"" following the publication of answers online. This comes after students reportedly gained access to examination content before sitting their tests. The affected units, which include Computer Systems Algorithms and Programming, and Computer Systems Storage, were due to be assessed in June. OCR states that ""the security of our exams is of the utmost importance,"" and that the decision to replace the units was made in response to an identified breach. The exam board is working closely with schools to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by this unexpected change. OCR has confirmed that students will still be able to complete the required content for their GCSE, albeit through alternative means. ""We understand that this will cause inconvenience for some students and teachers,"" OCR said in a statement. ""We are committed to minimising the impact on learners and will be providing updates as soon as possible."" This latest development comes amid growing concerns over the security of GCSE exams, with several boards reporting incidents of leakage in recent years. In 2018, the exam board AQA was forced to cancel a GCSE English Language paper after malpractice was detected. The British Computer Society (BCS), the professional body for IT, has expressed its disappointment at the situation. ""It is deeply concerning that exam content for GCSE Computing has been leaked,"" said David Clarke, BCS Education Policy Manager. ""This cannot be allowed to undermine the integrity of the qualification and the hard work of students and teachers."" The BCS has called for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the leak and for immediate action to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Meanwhile, the Department for Education has stated that it is working with OCR and other exam boards to ""ensure the security of exams and to prevent the publication of exam content online."" For their part, schools are urging students to focus on their studies and to avoid engaging with any online resources that may be offering exam content. ""Our priority is to ensure that our students have the best possible chance of success in their exams,"" said one headteacher. ""We will be providing alternative resources to help them prepare for the revised units, and we encourage students to stay focused on their learning."" As the situation unfolds, the educational community is urging exam boards to take robust action to protect the integrity of GCSE exams and to minimise the impact on students. OCR has promised to keep schools and students informed of any developments.

Small businesses in Scottish council spend call,"The FSB (Federation of Small Businesses) strongly advocated for greater transparency and accountability in the spending habits of Scottish public bodies. In a recent statement, the organization called for public authorities to be mandated to regularly publish assessments of how they allocate and utilize their financial resources. Such assessments, according to the FSB, should include a thorough analysis of expenditures on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With an increasing number of small businesses contributing significantly to Scotland's economy, it is essential that public bodies recognize their role in fostering an environment conducive to their growth. By publishing spending assessments, local councils could demonstrate their commitment to supporting SMEs, as well as identify potential areas for improvement. Moreover, the FSB argued that public bodies should be required to report on the percentage of their contracts that go to SMEs, the average contract length, and the payment terms in place. Transparent reporting of this nature would enable small businesses to make informed decisions when tendering for contracts and help them build stronger relationships with local authorities. The FSB also emphasized the importance of early payment practices in enhancing the financial stability of SMEs. Often, small businesses face significant cash flow issues due to prolonged payment terms or late payments, which can hinder their growth and development. By requiring public bodies to adhere to a strict payment schedule, the FSB believed that it would promote better payment practices across the board and create a more level playing field for SMEs. To further encourage public bodies to engage with local SMEs, the FSB recommended that councils explore the possibility of creating a dedicated procurement team or a central database of small businesses. This would facilitate easier access to information, streamline the tendering process, and ensure that SMEs are given equal opportunities to participate in council contracts. The FSB's proposals come at a crucial time, as the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its public procurement policies. The organization urges policymakers to take note of these recommendations and to consider the needs of SMEs when drafting new guidelines. By ensuring that local councils are accountable for their spending and actively engage with SMEs, the Scottish economy is poised to benefit from a more vibrant, diverse, and inclusive business landscape.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Brexit: Trade deal now looking remote,"Laura Kuenssberg @bbclaurakencyclesbtw But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of arduous talks designed to create a smooth path for post-Brexit trade between the UK and EU. As the clock ticks down on the December 31st deadline, the gulf between the two parties appears to have widened rather than narrowed. The key sticking points remain: fisheries, the level playing field, and the governance of any future agreement. The EU's insistence on maintaining access to UK fishing waters has long been a contentious issue for the UK government. Boris Johnson's promise to ""take back control"" of British waters has been a rallying cry for Brexit supporters. However, the EU's refusal to budge on this issue has left negotiations at a stalemate. The level playing field, or state aid, is another major issue. The EU wants the UK to commit to abide by EU rules on state aid and environmental regulations in order to ensure fair competition between the two parties. The UK, on the other hand, sees this as an infringement on its sovereignty. The governance of any future agreement is also a significant hurdle. The EU wants a mechanism to ensure that any future disputes can be resolved through the European Court of Justice. The UK, however, wants to avoid any role for the ECJ in its legal system. Despite the mounting pressure to reach a deal, the UK has shown little sign of conceding on these key issues. The EU, too, appears unwilling to make significant concessions. EU leaders have made it clear that they will not compromise on the principles that underpin the bloc. The potential outcomes of a no-deal Brexit are far-reaching and uncertain. Tariffs would be imposed on goods traded between the UK and EU, leading to increased costs for businesses and consumers. There would also be disruption to the movement of goods across borders, potentially leading to shortages and delays. The UK government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario for some time, but the impact on businesses and individuals could be significant. The automotive industry, for example, could be hit particularly hard, with tariffs on car exports to the EU potentially leading to job losses and increased costs for consumers. As the deadline approaches, the pressure on both sides to reach a deal is mounting. However, with key issues remaining unresolved, a no-deal Brexit now looks increasingly likely. The implications for the UK and EU will be far-reaching and uncertain, and the potential for disruption and economic instability cannot be ignored.

Suspected Tamil rebels shot dead in Sri Lanka,"By Charles Haviland, BBC News, Colombo It says they were taking instructions from two LTTE leaders based in Europe. The reported incident, if true, is the first substantial military engagement between the Sri Lankan security forces and the Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), also known as the Tamil Tigers, since the end of the civil war in 2009. According to reliable military sources, a group of around 20 suspected rebels were killed during a pre-dawn raid on a jungle camp in the eastern province of Ampara on Saturday. The sources add that the security forces seized explosives and other weapons, which they believe were intended for use in attacks against government targets. The killings come amid growing concerns that the LTTE, which was once a formidable militant organisation with an extensive global network, is making a resurgence. In recent months, there have been a number of small-scale attacks and attempted attacks on military installations and police stations in the eastern and northern parts of the country. The military believes that the suspected rebels were part of a cell that had been planning to carry out attacks in the run-up to the national day celebrations on 4 February. The LTTE waged a brutal civil war against the Sri Lankan government for nearly three decades, which left tens of thousands of people dead and displaced. The conflict ended in May 2009, when government forces crushed the rebels in a final offensive. Since then, the LTTE has been officially classified as a terrorist organisation by several countries, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. But despite the peace, there have been sporadic reports of LTTE activity. In 2019, for example, the group claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a bus in Colombo that killed at least 27 people and injured more than 100 others. The LTTE's international network, which reportedly includes cells in several European countries, has been a major concern for security agencies. In 2018, a Norwegian court jailed a man for plotting to assassinate the Sri Lankan president and prime minister on behalf of the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has repeatedly urged foreign countries to take action against LTTE supporters and sympathisers, arguing that they pose a threat to national security. But there have been few tangible results so far. The reported killing of the suspected rebels in Ampara is likely to fuel further tensions between the government and the Tamil community, who accuse the military and police of human rights abuses. There have been widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances, which the government denies.

Wirelessly charged electric buses set for Milton Keynes,"By Neil Bowdler Science and technology reporter, BBC News A fleet of eight new electric vehicles will operate along a busy route in Milton Keynes from late January, and the buses can run for longer by virtue of a wireless charging technology that is set to revolutionize public transport. The buses, manufactured by Wrightbus, have been fitted with a system developed by the UK company, WitCharge. This innovative technology allows the vehicles to be charged while they are in motion and at bus stops, without the need for physical contact. The system works by using a series of coils placed beneath the road surface at designated charging points. As the bus passes over these areas, an electromagnetic field is generated that transfers energy to the vehicle's onboard battery. According to WitCharge, the wireless charging system can add up to 30% of extra range to the vehicle's battery during each journey. This additional power will help to extend the length of each trip, making the buses more efficient and reducing the need for frequent charging. Milton Keynes Council has been working with Wrightbus and WitCharge to introduce the wireless charging buses to the town as part of a wider plan to reduce emissions and improve air quality. The new fleet is expected to save around 4,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year, equivalent to taking around 800 cars off the road. The buses will operate on the X9 route, which serves the town center and the nearby university campus. The X9 is one of the town's busiest services, carrying around 1.5 million passengers a year. The introduction of wireless charging buses in Milton Keynes marks a significant step forward in the development of this technology. WitCharge claims that its system is more efficient and cost-effective than traditional charging methods, which require the bus to stop at a charging station for an extended period of time. The company is currently in talks with other transport operators and local authorities to roll out the technology more widely. WitCharge believes that wireless charging could be particularly useful in cities and towns where buses operate in heavy traffic, as the technology can help to reduce congestion and save time. The Milton Keynes buses are not the first to use wireless charging technology. In 2019, the Dutch city of Eindhoven introduced wireless charging buses on its Route 10 line. However, the Milton Keynes project is significant because it is the first time that the technology has been used in the UK and on a bus route with such high passenger numbers. The introduction of wireless charging buses in Milton Keynes is part of a wider push to decarbonize public transport. The UK government has set a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and the transport sector is one of the major contributors to the country'",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

However, as they prepared to board, an unexpected mechanical fault struck, leaving the vessel stranded in the bay. Despite the initial disappointment, the Landmark Trust, the organization that leases Lundy Island, sprang into action. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, they swiftly arranged for an alternative ferry service to transport the stranded visitors back to the mainland. The visitors, though initially disheartened, demonstrated remarkable resilience and flexibility in the face of adversity. They spent the day exploring the quaint island village, taking in the breathtaking views, and engaging in activities organized by the Landmark Trust. As evening approached, the alternative ferry, the Swanland, arrived, allowing the holidaymakers to finally begin their journey home. The sense of relief was palpable as they boarded the vessel, knowing that they would soon be reunited with their loved ones and familiar surroundings. The unexpected turn of events left many of the visitors reflecting on the serendipitous nature of their island adventure. As they made their way back to the mainland, they couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to experience the beauty and tranquility of Lundy Island, even if their stay was cut short. The Landmark Trust, ever attentive to the needs of its visitors, ensured that those who wished to return to the island at a later date were offered priority bookings and financial incentives.

Essex lorry deaths: Accused made earlier crossing attempt,"The tragic events of 23 October last year unfolded as a group of Vietnamese nationals, aged between 15 and 44, suffered a brutal fate in the back of a lorry as it was transported from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet in Essex, England. The harrowing details of their final moments were revealed in the ongoing trial at the Old Bailey. As the jury listened intently, it was outlined how the victims had been sealed in the pitch-black, unventilated trailer, with no access to air or means of escape. The temperature inside the lorry rose rapidly, leading to the suffocation of all those trapped within. Prosecutors revealed that the driver of the lorry, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had attempted to make the same dangerous crossing just one month earlier in September 2020. He had been stopped by Belgian authorities before making it to the UK, but managed to return with the fatal load in October. Detective Constable Mark Jones from the Essex Police, who led the investigation, stated in court: ""It is believed that the lorry driver had made a previous attempt to bring a similar group of Vietnamese nationals into the country in September 2020. He was identified by Belgian authorities and the group was dispersed. The driver is then believed to have returned to Belgium and attempted the journey again in October 2020."" The court also heard testimonies from Belgian border police who had stopped the lorry on 15 September 2020. The driver, who was later identified as the defendant, had been found with 22 Vietnamese nationals concealed in the trailer at the time. The group was taken to a reception centre, and it is understood that they were later allowed to continue their journey to the UK. The tragedy of the Essex lorry deaths has brought renewed focus on the issue of people smuggling and the dangerous journeys that many take in the pursuit of a better life. The investigation and trial are ongoing, and the outcome will no doubt have significant implications for those involved and the wider issue of illegal immigration. As the court proceedings continue, the families and friends of the victims wait anxiously for closure and justice. The harrowing details of their final moments serve as a stark reminder of the human cost of this ongoing issue. The defence has yet to present its case, and it remains to be seen whether the driver will be found guilty of the manslaughter charges. The trial is expected to last several weeks, and the outcome will no doubt be closely watched by the public and immigration policy makers. As the story unfolds, it is crucial to remember the human element behind the statistics and the tragic loss of life. The victims were individuals with families, dreams, and aspirations, and their lives were cut short in the pursuit of a better future. ",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Golden and sea eagle decline since Dark Ages mapped,"In the annals of history, the golden eagle and the sea eagle held a revered place in the folklore and mythology of various cultures. These majestic birds of prey, with their powerful talons and sharp vision, were often associated with strength, courage, and wisdom. However, the populations of these birds have seen a significant decline since the Dark Ages, and researchers have been working tirelessly to map out the extent of this decline. To gain insights into the populations of these birds during the early medieval period, researchers looked to places named after eagles in both Gaelic and Old English. By examining historical records and place names, they were able to estimate the numbers of golden eagles and sea eagles that once thrived in these areas. From the Dark Ages, they discovered that the golden eagle was a common sight in many parts of Europe, including Scotland, Wales, and England. The bird was held in high regard by the Celts, who believed that the golden eagle represented the sun god. In Wales, the golden eagle was known as the ""ensign of the princes,"" and it was said that any prince who did not own a golden eagle was not truly a prince at all. The sea eagle, on the other hand, was a more elusive bird, with its population centered around the coasts of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. In Old English, the sea eagle was known as the ""sea wyrm,"" a name that hinted at the fearsome reputation of this bird. The sea eagle was a powerful predator, with a wingspan of up to 7 feet and a sharp beak that could tear apart the flesh of a seal or a fish. However, the populations of both the golden eagle and the sea eagle began to decline in the medieval period. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. One major factor was the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, which led to the destruction of habitats that were essential for the survival of these birds. Another factor was the persecution of eagles by humans, who saw them as threats to livestock or as symbols of evil. Despite these challenges, there were pockets of resistance to the decline of the eagle populations. In Scotland, for instance, the golden eagle was protected by the law, and it was considered a symbol of the Scottish monarchy. The sea eagle, too, was protected by the law in some areas, and there were reports of successful breeding programs in the late medieval and early modern periods. Today, the populations of the golden eagle and the sea eagle continue to face threats, including habitat loss, poisoning, and climate change. However, there are also efforts underway to protect and conserve these birds, from reintroduction programs to the establishment of protected areas. By learning from the past, we can work to ensure that the majestic golden eagle and the powerful sea eagle continue",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Homeless people struggle to access healthcare, report says","A third of people surveyed by housing charity Cymorth Cymru revealed that health problems played a significant role in their homelessness. The charity's report, ""No Place Like Home,"" highlighted the urgent need for better healthcare access and housing support for this vulnerable group. The study, which surveyed over 1,000 homeless people in Wales, found that those with long-term health conditions were more likely to lose their homes due to the financial strain caused by medical bills and the inability to work. Additionally, people with mental health issues often struggled to maintain stable housing due to the lack of affordable and safe options. The report made seven recommendations to address these issues. Firstly, health boards were urged to prioritize housing as a critical social determinant of health and to work closely with local authorities and housing providers. Secondly, landlords were encouraged to accept housing benefit payments directly to ease the financial burden on tenants. Thirdly, councils were advised to ensure that emergency accommodation was available for those in crisis and that it met basic health and safety standards. Fourthly, primary care services should be more accessible to homeless people to prevent hospital admissions and reduce the risk of long-term health problems. Fifthly, health professionals were urged to be more proactive in identifying and addressing housing issues among their patients. Sixthly, there was a call for more investment in mental health services, as these services often faced significant funding cuts, leaving many homeless people without adequate support. Lastly, the report emphasized the importance of a coordinated response from all stakeholders involved in addressing homelessness and healthcare. This included governments, NGOs, and community organizations. The report's findings echoed those of similar studies conducted in other parts of the UK and around the world. Homelessness and poor health are interconnected issues, with homelessness exacerbating health problems and health problems contributing to homelessness. The Welsh Government responded to the report by announcing an additional Â£10 million investment in emergency accommodation and support services for homeless people. However, critics argued that more significant and long-term solutions were needed to tackle the root causes of homelessness and ensure that everyone had access to basic healthcare and a safe and secure place to call home. In conclusion, the ""No Place Like Home"" report underscores the urgent need for better healthcare access and housing support for homeless people. The recommendations, if implemented effectively, could make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of homeless individuals in Wales and beyond. However, more investment, political will, and coordinated action are required to ensure that these recommendations become a reality and that everyone has access to the basic human rights of healthcare and shelter.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
JVP 'planned to kill' MP,"A senior leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), Sunil Handunnetti, MP, is currently under house arrest by the party following his attempted flight from the country, his close associate Sampath revealed. The incident has sent shockwaves through the political circles of Sri Lanka, with allegations of a planned assassination against Handunnetti. Handunnetti, a prominent figure in the JVP, was a key player in the party's political maneuverings and was known for his vocal opposition to the government. According to sources, he had been expressing fears for his safety in the wake of increasing political tensions and threats from unknown sources. The JVP leadership, however, denied any involvement in Handunnetti's arrest, describing it as an internal matter. They claimed that Handunnetti had been placed under house arrest for disciplinary reasons, following a series of allegations leveled against him. ""He had been creating problems within the party for some time now,"" a senior JVP member said on condition of anonymity. ""His actions were causing unnecessary tensions and dividing the party. The leadership felt it was necessary to take action."" Handunnetti's close associates, however, were skeptical of this explanation. ""Sunil was a loyal party member and a dedicated politician,"" Sampath said. ""He had no reason to create trouble within the party. Something more sinister is at play here."" Rumors of a plot to assassinate Handunnetti had been circulating in political circles for some weeks, with some sources claiming that he had received death threats from unknown quarters. The JVP leadership had denied these allegations, dismissing them as baseless rumors. The incident came at a time when political tensions in Sri Lanka were running high, with the ruling coalition and the opposition engaged in a bitter power struggle. The government has been accused of using heavy-handed tactics to suppress dissent, while the opposition has been criticized for engaging in violent protests. The JVP, a radical leftist party with a history of militant activism, has been a key player in Sri Lankan politics for decades. The party has a sizeable following among the country's marginalized communities and has been a vocal critic of the government's policies. Handunnetti's arrest and the allegations of a planned assassination have raised concerns about the state of political freedoms in Sri Lanka and the rule of law. Human rights groups have called for an independent investigation into the matter, while opposition leaders have demanded the release of Handunnetti and an end to what they describe as a culture of intimidation and violence. As the situation continues to unfold, the future of Sri Lankan politics remains uncertain. The JVP, which has a reputation for being a tough and resilient party, is unlikely to back down easily.

Coronavirus: Pubs and bars probe after Newport spike,"Public Health Wales (PHW) has announced an investigation following an increase in positive coronavirus cases in the Newport area. Newport has the fourth highest number of confirmed cases in Wales, with 301 people testing positive for the virus as of September 15. The increase in cases has raised concerns among health officials, prompting PHW to work closely with local authorities and businesses to identify the source of the outbreak. The focus of the investigation is on the city centre, where a number of pubs and bars have reported high footfall and potential breaches of social distancing guidelines. One pub, which has asked not to be named, has confirmed that several staff members and customers have tested positive for the virus. The pub has since closed temporarily for deep cleaning and contact tracing. The owner of the pub expressed his concern for the health and safety of his staff and customers, adding that the pub had been following all government guidelines. Another establishment, a popular bar in the city centre, has also reported several cases among its staff and customers. The bar has closed temporarily for deep cleaning and contact tracing, with the owner expressing his disappointment and frustration at the situation. He urged all customers who had visited the bar in the past two weeks to get tested for the virus as a precaution. The Newport City Council has issued a statement urging residents to take the situation seriously and follow all government guidelines. This includes wearing masks in public places, maintaining social distancing, and following the rule of six when meeting with others. The council has also reminded businesses of their responsibilities to ensure that they are following all guidelines and regulations. PHW has urged anyone who has tested positive for the virus or has been in close contact with someone who has to self-isolate immediately. They have also urged anyone with symptoms, however mild, to get tested as soon as possible. The investigation is ongoing, with PHW working closely with local authorities, businesses, and community leaders to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread. The situation in Newport serves as a reminder of the importance of following all government guidelines and taking the virus seriously, even as the number of cases in Wales continues to decline. The Welsh Government has expressed its support for the investigation and urged all residents to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their communities. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has emphasized the importance of following all guidelines and regulations, especially in the context of the ongoing pandemic. The Newport outbreak is a reminder that the fight against the virus is not over, and that everyone has a role to play in preventing further spread. By following all guidelines, getting tested when necessary, and taking all necessary precautions, we can help protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from the virus.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Labour MP apologises for calling pandemic 'good crisis',"Kate Green, the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, has issued an apology after coming under fire for remarks she made about the Covid-19 pandemic during her party's annual conference earlier this month. During an online event, Green was reported to have described the pandemic as a ""good crisis"" for Labour. The comments, which were made in the context of discussing opportunities for the party to address long-standing issues, were met with immediate criticism, both from within her own party and from the public. Speaking to Sky News, Green acknowledged the hurt and offense her comments had caused. ""I really regretted the words I used and I understand why they were hurtful and distressing to many people, particularly those who have been directly affected by the pandemic and have lost loved ones,"" she said. Green went on to explain that she had not intended to downplay the seriousness of the pandemic or the hardships it had caused. ""I was speaking about the challenges that come with any crisis, and the opportunities that can arise for positive change,"" she said. ""But I fully recognise that this was not well expressed and I apologise for any confusion or distress that my comments may have caused."" The Labour Party swiftly distanced itself from Green's comments, with party leader Keir Starmer issuing a statement saying that the pandemic was ""a human tragedy that has caused immense suffering and loss"". ""Our focus must be on supporting those who are going through a difficult time and working together to overcome this crisis,"" Starmer added. Green's apology comes as the UK continues to grapple with the ongoing challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, with cases and hospitalizations on the rise in many areas. The government has announced a number of new measures in recent days, including stricter restrictions on social gatherings and increased financial support for businesses and individuals. For Green and her colleagues in the Labour Party, the focus will now be on offering constructive criticism and support to the government as it seeks to navigate the crisis. The opposition party has faced criticism in the past for appearing to exploit the pandemic for political gain, and will be keen to avoid any further missteps in this area. As the UK enters a new phase of the pandemic, with the rollout of vaccines offering hope for a return to normalcy, the focus for all political leaders will be on finding solutions to the challenges posed by the crisis and offering support to those who have been hardest hit. Green's apology marks a recognition of the need for sensitivity and care in the face of such challenges, and a commitment to working constructively to find a way forward.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Denbighshire votes for extra sites for local development plan,"They were proposed after a government inspector raised concerns that Denbighshire County Council had not allocated sufficient land to meet the original target of 7,500 homes by 2021. A report from the inspector warned that without the addition of extra sites, he could declare the Local Development Plan (LDP) ""unsound,"" a term used to describe plans that do not meet the necessary requirements. Opponents of the new sites have expressed their concerns over the potential impact on local communities and the environment. Some argue that the council should focus on making better use of existing brownfield sites before considering new developments. At a recent meeting, council members debated the merits of the proposed sites. One councillor argued that the council had a responsibility to provide for the housing needs of its residents, while another emphasized the importance of protecting the green belt and preserving the character of local communities. The proposed sites include land at Bodelwyddan, Rhyl, and Denbigh. The plans include a mix of affordable and market-rate homes, as well as commercial and community facilities. However, opponents argue that the infrastructure to support these new communities is not in place, and that the strain on local services such as schools and healthcare facilities will be too great. Environmental groups have also raised concerns about the potential impact on wildlife habitats and the overall health of the local environment. Some have called for a more thorough assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed sites before any decisions are made. The council has said that it will listen to the concerns of local residents and take them into account as it moves forward with the LDP. A public consultation is expected to take place in the coming months, giving residents the opportunity to voice their opinions and ask questions about the proposed sites. The council has also assured residents that it will work closely with developers to ensure that any new developments are sustainable and that infrastructure is put in place to support the new communities. However, some remain skeptical, arguing that the council has not done enough to address the concerns raised in the past. As the debate continues, it is clear that the proposed sites are a contentious issue in Denbighshire. While some see them as a necessary step to meet housing targets and support the local economy, others are concerned about the impact on the environment and the strain on local services. Only time will tell whether the council will be able to find a balance between these competing priorities and move forward with the LDP.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Brazilian Senate eases Amazon protection rules,"The Brazilian Senate's recent decision to ease Amazon protection rules has sparked controversy both domestically and internationally. The bill, which now returns to the lower house for final approval, aims to provide legal certainty for farmers and ranchers in the Amazon region. However, environmentalists warn that this could lead to increased destruction of the world's largest tropical rainforest. The legislation, which was passed with a narrow margin in the Senate, eases fines for some previous illegal clearance if farmers commit to a reforestation programme. Supporters argue that Brazil needs more land for food production to ensure food security for its growing population. They believe that the new regulations will help reduce conflicts between farmers and environmental agencies by providing legal certainty. However, critics argue that the bill undermines the protections afforded to the Amazon rainforest. They point out that reforestation programmes take time and resources, and there is no guarantee that farmers will stick to them. Moreover, they argue that the Amazon rainforest is not only crucial for global carbon sequestration but also plays a vital role in regulating the world's climate. Environmental groups have expressed their concern over the potential impact of the bill on the Amazon. Greenpeace Brazil's Amazon Campaigner, Marcio Astrini, stated, ""This bill puts profits before people and the planet. It is a step backwards in our efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest."" He added that the bill would only encourage more illegal deforestation in the region. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) also expressed its concern over the bill. ""The Amazon rainforest is a vital ecosystem that needs protection. The easing of fines for illegal deforestation sends the wrong message to those who continue to destroy the forest,"" said Maria Helena Ramos, WWF's Amazon Forest Programme Director. The international community has also weighed in on the issue. The European Union, which is Brazil's largest trading partner, has threatened to take action if the bill is passed into law. European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans warned that the EU would consider imposing trade sanctions on Brazil if it fails to protect the Amazon. The debate over the bill highlights the complexities of balancing economic development with environmental protection. While some argue that Brazil needs more land for food production, others believe that the Amazon rainforest is too valuable to be sacrificed for short-term economic gains. The fate of the Amazon remains uncertain as the bill makes its way through the lower house of the Brazilian Congress.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Australia to hold royal commission inquiry into banks,"Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced on Thursday that Australia will hold a royal commission inquiry into its banking sector, following intensifying public pressure over numerous scandals that have tarnished the reputation of the country's financial institutions. Speaking to reporters in Canberra, Mr. Turnbull acknowledged the mounting concerns and asserted that the commission - Australia's highest form of public inquiry - would help restore confidence in the sector. ""This is about ensuring accountability, ensuring transparency, and ensuring that the community has confidence in the integrity of the banking sector,"" the Prime Minister said. Australian banks have been embroiled in various scandals in recent times, with the most recent being the revelation of widespread fees for no service and other unethical practices by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the country's corporate regulator, has also been criticized for its handling of these issues. Mr. Turnbull had resisted calls for a royal commission for months, arguing that the existing regulatory framework was sufficient and that the government was taking appropriate action. However, the public outcry continued to grow louder, with opposition parties and consumer groups demanding a more comprehensive inquiry. The decision to hold a royal commission came after the release of a report by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which found that the cultural issues within the banks were more deeply entrenched than previously believed. The report identified a ""profit at all costs"" mentality, a lack of accountability, and a culture of complacency and indifference. The inquiry, which is expected to cost around AUD 75 million, will be headed by a retired judge and will have the power to summon witnesses and demand documents. Its terms of reference will be broad and will cover all aspects of the banking sector, including governance, culture, and customer treatment. The announcement of the royal commission was welcomed by the opposition Labor Party, which has been pushing for such an inquiry for over a year. ""The Australian people have been crying out for a royal commission, and finally, the Prime Minister has listened,"" opposition leader Bill Shorten said in a statement. The banking sector has already begun preparing for the inquiry, with the major banks announcing that they will set aside funds to cover any potential costs or penalties. The CEOs of the major banks have also expressed their support for the inquiry and have pledged to cooperate fully. The royal commission is expected to begin its work in the coming months and is likely to take several years to complete. Its findings and recommendations will be closely watched both domestically and internationally, and it could lead to significant reforms in the banking sector. In the meantime, Mr. Turnbull has urged Australians to have faith in the banking sector and assured them that the government is taking the issue seriously.

Hexham BID business levy to be scrapped over 'retaliation' fears,"Directors of the Hexham Business Improvement District (BID) have announced their intention to wind up the company, citing concerns over potential retaliation from businesses as the primary reason. The BID, which was launched in 2016 with the aim of improving the town's business environment, has been beset by problems in its short existence. Last year, about a third of the business community voted against the renewal of the BID levy, which funds the organisation's activities. This was a significant blow to the organisation, as the majority vote is required for the levy to continue. The directors attributed this to dissatisfaction with the BID's performance and perceived lack of value for money. In the wake of this setback, the organisation has struggled to secure the necessary funds to continue operating. Efforts to secure external funding have been unsuccessful, and the directors have now decided that the best course of action is to wind up the company. The decision to wind up the BID has not been taken lightly, and directors have expressed their disappointment at the situation. They had hoped that the organisation could continue to make a positive contribution to the town's business environment, but the lack of support from the business community has made this impossible. The wind-up process is expected to take several months, during which time the BID's assets will be sold and any outstanding debts will be paid off. It is unclear what will happen to the BID's ongoing projects, such as the town centre improvement works, but the directors are working to find a solution. The news of the BID's imminent demise has been met with mixed reactions from the business community. Some businesses have expressed relief that they will no longer be required to pay the levy, while others have expressed disappointment at the loss of a potentially valuable resource. The directors have emphasised that their decision to wind up the BID was not a reflection of any wrongdoing on their part, but rather a response to the lack of support from the business community. They have pledged to work with the council and other stakeholders to find a way forward for the town's business environment, and have urged businesses to continue working together to promote Hexham as a thriving business destination. Despite the challenges faced by the BID, there is a sense of optimism among some in the business community that a new approach may be needed to revitalise the town's business environment. The wind-up process represents an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the past and to forge a new path forward. Only time will tell what the future holds for Hexham's business community, but one thing is certain: the town's businesses will continue to face challenges and will need to work together to overcome them.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Casualties from cluster munitions doubled in 2016,"A new report by the Cluster Munition Coalition revealed that the number of casualties from cluster munitions more than doubled in 2016, with a staggering 971 people killed or injured worldwide. Among the victims, 860 were reported in conflict-affected areas, primarily in Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan. Cluster munitions are indiscriminate weapons that continue to pose a threat long after an initial attack. They are designed to disperse numerous explosive sub-munitions over a wide area, often leaving behind unexploded ordnance that can claim lives and limbs long after the conflict has ended. In Syria, where the conflict entered its seventh year in 2016, cluster munitions were used extensively, resulting in the highest number of casualties. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that at least 528 people were killed or injured by these weapons last year. The majority of victims were civilians, including 142 children and 95 women. Yemen, another conflict-torn country, also saw a significant increase in cluster munition casualties. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project documented 81 civilian casualties in Yemen due to cluster munitions in 2016, a 60% increase from the previous year. Afghanistan, despite a decrease in the use of cluster munitions in 2016 compared to the previous year, still reported 53 civilian casualties from these weapons. The majority of these casualties occurred in the southern province of Helmand. The use of cluster munitions is prohibited under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which was adopted in 2008 and has been ratified by 101 states. However, 13 countries still possess and use these weapons, including Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan. The report emphasized the urgent need for all states, especially those still using cluster munitions, to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions and to take immediate action to clear the stockpiles and contaminated areas of these deadly weapons. ""The human cost of cluster munitions is devastating, and the use of these weapons in populated areas is unacceptable,"" said Hanaa Singer, executive director of the Cluster Munition Coalition. ""It is essential that all states take immediate steps to prevent further harm to civilians by joining the Convention on Cluster Munitions and taking concrete actions to clear contaminated areas and destroy their stockpiles."" The report also called on donor countries to provide adequate funding for humanitarian demining and victim assistance programs to help those affected by cluster munitions. The financial burden of clearance and victim assistance efforts is significant, with an estimated $1.5 billion needed annually to address the global cluster munition problem.

What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories?,"James Landale, Diplomatic correspondent @BBCJLandaleon Twitter Britain has 14 overseas territories. They are mostly former colonies and are located all over the world, from Gibraltar and the Falklands in the Americas, to Anguilla, Turks and Caicos, and the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. These territories, which also include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, have unique relationships with the UK. The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) are not part of the EU, but they benefit from many EU agreements. The UK is responsible for their defense and foreign affairs. The territories themselves have varying degrees of self-governance, with some, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, having a high degree of autonomy. The UK's commitment to its overseas territories is enshrined in law. The constitutional relationship between the UK and each territory is set out in a constitution or a constitutionally entrenched agreement. This relationship is known as ""constitutional dependency"". The UK Government's commitment to its overseas territories is also reflected in the White Paper on the UK Overseas Territories, published in 2017. This document outlines the UK's role as a ""supportive partner"" and sets out the government's vision for the future of the territories. One of the key areas of UK commitment is to the territories' economic development. The UK provides funding for infrastructure projects, education, and healthcare. The UK also encourages private sector investment and provides technical assistance. Another area of commitment is to the territories' security. The UK provides military support and trains local security forces. The UK also works with international partners to address regional security challenges. The UK's commitment to the environment is also important. Many of the territories are home to unique ecosystems, such as the rainforests of St. Lucia, the coral reefs of the Cayman Islands, and the volcanic landscapes of Montserrat. The UK provides funding for conservation projects and works with local communities to promote sustainable development. The UK's relationship with its overseas territories is not without challenges. There have been disputes over fishing rights in the Falklands and Gibraltar, and some territories face economic challenges, such as high levels of debt and unemployment. Despite these challenges, the UK remains committed to its overseas territories. The UK sees these territories as an important part of its global responsibilities and as valuable contributors to the international community. In conclusion, the UK's commitments to its overseas territories are legal, constitutional, and moral. The UK provides support for the territories' economic development, security, and environmental sustainability",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pubic hair grooming 'STI risk linked to skin tears',"Doctors warn that the small tears in the skin caused by shaving or trimming pubic hair could increase the risk of contracting Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). This warning comes as more people are turning to grooming their pubic hair for cosmetic reasons. Groomers, both professional and at-home, should be aware of the potential risks associated with hair removal. While the process may leave the skin looking smooth and clean, it can also create microscopic tears in the skin, creating entry points for bacteria and viruses. According to the American Sexual Health Association, some STIs, such as herpes, can enter the body through small cuts or abrasions in the skin. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can also spread through mucous membranes, which are found in the genital area. Dr. Jane Smith, a dermatologist, explains, ""When you shave or wax, you're essentially creating small wounds on the skin. These wounds can be an entry point for bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can cause infections."" Furthermore, the use of razors or other grooming tools can spread existing infections. For instance, someone with herpes can unknowingly introduce the virus to other areas of their body or to their sexual partners during grooming. To minimize the risks associated with pubic hair grooming, doctors recommend the following: 1. Use sharp razors: Dull blades can cause more tears in the skin, increasing the risk of infection. 2. Clean your equipment: Make sure to clean your razors or grooming tools before and after use. 3. Use shaving cream or gel: This can help reduce friction and prevent skin irritation and tears. 4. Don't share your tools: Sharing razors or other grooming equipment can spread STIs and other infections. 5. Practice safe sex: Using protection during sexual activity can help prevent the spread of STIs. 6. Be aware of signs and symptoms: If you notice any unusual symptoms, such as itching, burning, or discharge, contact your healthcare provider. Grooming your pubic hair is a personal choice, but it's essential to be aware of the potential risks associated with the process. By taking proper precautions and being mindful of your health, you can enjoy the benefits of grooming while minimizing the risks.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Term-time holiday outlook - what might change?,"By Judith Burns, Education reporter Schools in England are gearing up for another term, with many parents looking forward to the upcoming half-term break. However, the holiday outlook for the coming school year could see some changes, as the government continues to push for greater attendance and crack down on unauthorised absences. The Department for Education (DfE) has maintained its stance that reducing school absence is a priority, despite criticism from some educational professionals and parents. The policy, which includes fines for parents whose children miss school without a valid reason, has been a contentious issue since its introduction. However, they maintain the policy to reduce school absence is ""clear and correct"" and they also plan to strengthen it. The DfE announced last month that it will be consulting on new measures to prevent term-time holidays, including increasing the fines for parents and making it easier for local authorities to prosecute those who persistently flout the rules. The move has sparked anger among some parents, who argue that the pressure to attend school every day is causing undue stress and anxiety for children and their families. They claim that a few days away from the classroom can help to rejuvenate tired pupils and improve their academic performance in the long run. ""Term-time holidays are an essential part of family life,"" said Sarah, a mother of two from Manchester. ""We always take our children out of school for a week or two during the holidays to go on a family trip. It's a chance for us all to bond and create memories that will last a lifetime."" However, the DfE argues that attendance is crucial for academic success and that missing even a few days of school can have a detrimental impact on a child's learning. They also point out that many other countries do not allow for term-time holidays and that there is evidence that this approach leads to better educational outcomes. The debate is set to continue, with many parents and educational professionals calling for a more flexible approach to attendance. Some have suggested that schools could be more understanding of the needs of families and offer more flexible holiday arrangements, while others have called for a review of the fines system and a more nuanced approach to dealing with unauthorised absences. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the issue of attendance and unauthorised absences will remain a contentious one for the foreseeable future. With the consultation on new measures set to begin soon, parents and educational professionals will be watching closely to see what changes, if any, are on the horizon. One thing is for sure, the debate around term-time holidays and attendance is far from over, and it will continue to be a hot topic in the world of education in the coming months and years.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Manchester homeless man's shock at Spice use in city,"In the space of a year, William Nicholson, a former Manchester resident, has noticed a marked rise in the use of a formerly legal drug that has once again cast a dark shadow over the city. Mr. Nicholson, who spent six months in Manchester in 2016 before finding temporary shelter in a hostel outside the city, returned in 2017 to find the streets awash with a substance that was thought to have been largely eradicated. The drug, Spice, is a synthetic cannabinoid that was once sold legally in head shops and online before being banned in 2016 due to its severe health risks and addictive properties. Despite the ban, Mr. Nicholson was shocked to find large numbers of homeless people using the drug openly on the streets. ""I've seen people using it in broad daylight, in the middle of the city centre,"" he said. ""It's heart-breaking to see people who are already in such a vulnerable position being drawn deeper into addiction."" Mr. Nicholson, who is now living in a hostel in Liverpool, described the effects of Spice as ""terrifying."" He recalled seeing one man in Manchester who appeared to be under its influence, pacing back and forth and muttering to himself. ""He was completely out of it, mumbling to himself and swearing at passing pedestrians,"" Mr. Nicholson said. ""It was obvious that he was under the influence of something, but when I asked him what he had taken, he just looked at me blankly. All he could do was repeat the same few words over and over again."" Mr. Nicholson's concerns about the rise of Spice use in Manchester are shared by local authorities and homeless charities. The Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd, recently called for a crackdown on the sale and use of the drug, stating that it was ""causing misery for many vulnerable people."" The chief executive of the Manchester homeless charity, Crisis, Matt Thomason, also voiced his concerns, stating that Spice use was a major issue for the city's homeless population. ""Spice is a particularly insidious substance, and its use among homeless people is a major concern,"" he said. ""It can lead to a range of health problems, including paranoia, hallucinations, and violent behaviour, and it can be extremely difficult to help people overcome an addiction to it."" Despite these concerns, however, Mr. Nicholson is not optimistic about the situation improving any time soon. ""The problem with Spice is that it's so cheap and easy to get hold of,"" he said. ""As long as there's a market for it, people will continue to sell it, and vulnerable people will continue to use it."" Mr. Nicholson's experiences in Manchester are a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against drug",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Tyne and Wear Metro strike: Commuters and shoppers affected,"The network has been brought to a standstill after talks between operator Nexus and the RMT union broke down. Nexus and the RMT union have been in negotiations over pay, pensions, and working conditions for Tyne and Wear Metro staff. The union announced that its members would take industrial action if their demands were not met, and on this particular day, the threat became a reality. Commuters and shoppers in Newcastle and the surrounding areas were hit hard by the sudden cessation of metro services. The normally bustling stations were deserted, and the usual hustle and bustle of people rushing to work or to the shops was replaced by a somber silence. Those who had planned to travel by metro were left stranded, unsure of how to get to their destinations. The disruption to services also had a significant impact on local businesses. Many rely on the footfall generated by commuters and shoppers using the metro to get to their premises. With no metro services available, those businesses saw a sharp decline in customers, leading to a potential loss of revenue. The city council and local authorities were scrambling to find alternative transport solutions for those affected by the strike. Bus and taxi services were put on standby to help commuters get to work or to their appointments. Moreover, some employers were allowing their staff to work from home to reduce the number of people needing to travel into the city. The RMT union, meanwhile, expressed its disappointment at the failure of the negotiations and the resulting disruption to services. The union's general secretary, Mick Lynch, stated that the union would continue to fight for fair pay, pensions, and working conditions for its members. The union also urged Nexus to engage in further talks to reach a resolution. Nexus, for its part, expressed its frustration at the strike action and the resulting disruption to services. The operator stated that it had made a fair offer to the union and that it was disappointed that the union had chosen to resort to strike action. Nexus also urged the union to call off the strike and return to the negotiating table. As the day wore on, it became clear that the strike action was causing significant hardship for commuters and businesses in the area. The disruption to services was also having a ripple effect, with other forms of transport experiencing increased demand as people sought alternative ways to get around. The situation was a reminder of the importance of fair and productive labor negotiations and the impact that industrial action can have on individuals and businesses. As the situation continued to unfold, all involved would be hoping for a swift resolution to the dispute and the restoration of metro services.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Virus rebuilds heart's own pacemaker in animal tests,"By James Gallagher, Health and science reporter, BBC News The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals and if these go awry, the consequences can be fatal. However, scientists have taken a step closer to developing a heart that can repair itself by using a genetically-modified virus to rebuild the organ's own pacemaker. Researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), injected the virus into the hearts of mice with a condition similar to human heart failure. The virus, which carries a gene for a protein called Tbx18, was designed to infect and reprogram heart cells. The protein, which helps regulate heart development, was shown to restore the electrical activity of the heart in the mice. The findings, published in the journal Nature, could potentially lead to new treatments for heart failure, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively around the body. It can be caused by various conditions, including damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack, high blood pressure, or infections. The heart's natural pacemaker, located in the right atrium, is responsible for initiating each heartbeat. However, in heart failure, this pacemaker can malfunction, leading to an irregular heart rhythm. The UCSD team, led by Dr. Shuibing Chen, used a harmless adeno-associated virus (AAV) to carry the Tbx18 gene into the hearts of the mice. The virus infected heart cells and caused them to produce the Tbx18 protein, which reprogrammed the cells into pacemaker cells. The researchers found that the newly-formed pacemaker cells were able to restore the heart's normal electrical activity, improving the mice's heart function. ""We were able to reprogram heart cells into pacemaker cells and restore their ability to initiate heartbeats,"" said Dr. Chen. ""This could provide a new approach to treating heart failure."" The researchers are now planning further studies to determine whether the technique can be used in larger animals and eventually in humans. Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 26 million people are living with heart failure, and more than half of them die within five years of diagnosis. The development of a heart that can repair itself could be a major breakthrough in the treatment of heart failure and other heart conditions. ""This is an exciting development that could potentially lead to new treatments for heart failure,"" said Professor Derek Yach, executive director of the World Health Organization's noncommunicable diseases program. ""It's a promising step towards developing hearts that can repair themselves."" The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Brexit: Differences remain over trade deal, say UK and EU","UK negotiator Lord David Frost and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, met again last week to continue the intense negotiations over the post-Brexit trade deal between the two parties. Despite the marathon sessions and significant progress made in some areas, both sides acknowledged that ""wide divergences"" and ""serious divergences"" still existed, particularly over the contentious issues of fishing and competition rules. Lord Frost expressed his concerns regarding the EU's insistence on maintaining its access to British fishing waters, stating that the current proposal was ""unacceptable"" for the UK. He emphasized that the UK sought a fair and balanced agreement that respected its sovereignty and the interests of its fishing industry. The EU, on the other hand, stands firm on its position, arguing that the access to British waters has been a long-standing right for its fishermen. The issue of competition rules has also proved to be a significant stumbling block in the negotiations. Lord Frost stated that the EU's proposed regulations could potentially lead to a ""level playing field"" that could harm UK businesses, as it could mean having to adhere to EU rules even when selling goods and services to the EU market. The UK government insists that it should have the autonomy to set its own regulations and standards, without interference from the EU. Michel Barnier, for his part, reiterated the EU's position that any trade deal must ensure a ""fair and balanced"" relationship between the two parties. He stated that the EU would not compromise on its core principles, particularly those related to the protection of its single market and the rights of its member states. Barnier also emphasized the need for a ""robust enforcement mechanism"" to ensure that any agreement reached would be adhered to by both sides. As the negotiations continue, both sides remain committed to finding a mutually beneficial solution. However, the ""wide divergences"" and ""serious divergences"" over the contentious issues of fishing and competition rules remain a significant challenge. With the deadline for a deal fast approaching, the pressure is on for both negotiating teams to find a compromise that will satisfy the interests of their respective governments and citizens. The ongoing Brexit negotiations have far-reaching implications not only for the UK and the EU but also for their trading partners across the globe. As the world watches with bated breath, the outcome of these negotiations could shape the future of international trade and the global economic landscape. The stakes are high, and both sides are determined to secure a deal that reflects their interests and values.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Australia approves strikes against IS in Iraq,"Prime Minister Tony Abbott made a strong statement against the Islamic State (IS) militant group on Wednesday, declaring that Australia would join international coalition airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq. Speaking to reporters in Sydney, Abbott described IS as a ""death cult"" that had ""declared war on the world"" and must be stopped. IS controls a broad swathe of territory, spanning a borderless stretch of Syria and Iraq. The group, also known as ISIL or ISIS, has gained notoriety for its brutal tactics, including public beheadings and mass executions. It has also gained significant territory in both countries, with its self-proclaimed caliphate extending from the Syrian city of Raqqa to the outskirts of Baghdad in Iraq. Abbott emphasized that the threat posed by IS was not only to the Middle East, but to the entire world. ""We cannot allow this death cult to hold sway in the Middle East and beyond, and to inspire and recruit people to its cause here in Australia and around the world,"" he said. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) will contribute six F/A-18 Hornet jets and an E-7A Wedgetail early warning and control aircraft to the international coalition. The jets will conduct targeted airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq, while the Wedgetail will provide surveillance and command and control capabilities. Abbott said that the decision to join the coalition was not taken lightly, and that Australia would take every possible measure to minimize the risk to its personnel. ""We will not put our men and women in harm's way unnecessarily,"" he said. ""But we will do what is necessary to protect our national interests and to contribute to the international effort to degrade and ultimately defeat IS."" The Prime Minister also acknowledged the concerns of some Australians about the potential for increased terror threats at home. ""I understand that some Australians may be worried about the potential for increased terror threats as a result of our involvement in these airstrikes,"" he said. ""But I want to reassure Australians that we have some of the best intelligence and security agencies in the world, and they are working tirelessly to keep us safe."" Abbott's announcement came just a day after the United States launched its first airstrikes against IS targets in Syria. The international coalition, which also includes France, Canada, and the United Kingdom, has been conducting airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq since August 2014. The coalition aims to degrade IS's military capabilities and prevent the group from expanding its territory. Abbott's decision to join the coalition was widely supported by the Australian public, with a Newspoll conducted this week showing 63% of Australians in favor of the airstrikes.

Menzies Aviation workers face redundancy after global travel slump,"The Unite trade union announced on Thursday that Menzies Aviation, a leading provider of ground handling services for airlines, has initiated a 45-day consultation period with its employees regarding potential redundancies. Before the global travel industry came to a virtual standstill due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Menzies Aviation was one of the major players in the field. Now, with international travel restrictions in place and passenger numbers plummeting, the company finds itself facing significant financial challenges. Menzies Aviation has reportedly warned of up to 2,100 job losses in the UK alone, with further cuts likely to affect its workforce in other countries. The Unite union expressed deep concern over the situation and called on the company to explore all possible alternatives before resorting to redundancies. ""Menzies Aviation has been a major employer in the aviation industry for many years, and it is heart-breaking to see the scale of job losses being proposed,"" said a Unite official. ""We understand the financial pressures that the company is under due to the pandemic, but we believe there are other ways to address these challenges without resorting to compulsory redundancies,"" the official added. The union has urged Menzies Aviation to consider measures such as the use of the government's Job Retention Scheme, negotiating pay cuts with staff, or exploring new business opportunities in areas that have not been as severely affected by the pandemic. Menzies Aviation has stated that the consultation period will provide an opportunity for employees to raise their concerns and put forward proposals. The company's management has stressed that the decision to consider redundancies is not an easy one and that they will do their utmost to support affected employees through the process. The Unite union has called on the government to take a more proactive role in supporting the aviation industry, which has been one of the hardest-hit sectors during the pandemic. The union has also urged the company to engage in meaningful consultation with employees and their representatives to find a solution that minimizes the impact on workers. The consultation period is expected to end on April 15, after which Menzies Aviation is expected to make a final decision regarding redundancies. The outcome of the consultation will have significant implications not only for the affected workers but also for the wider aviation industry, which is struggling to cope with the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Challenge of Redcar blast furnace relighting,"Dave Johnson and Derek Thomas, two seasoned veterans with over 80 years of combined experience in the steel industry, sat huddled around the control room table as they prepared for the daunting task of relighting Redcar's blast furnace. The room was filled with the hum of monitors and the faint smell of oil and machinery. The weight of responsibility on their shoulders was palpable as they went through the final checks before the relighting process could begin. ""We've been through this drill countless times,"" Derek remarked, his voice steady and calm. ""But every time is different. You can never take it for granted."" Dave nodded in agreement. ""That's the nature of the business. We're dealing with vast amounts of energy and raw materials. One small misstep can lead to serious consequences."" The two men exchanged a knowing look. They had seen firsthand the power of the blast furnace â the intense heat, the towering flames, and the deafening noise. But they also knew the rewards. A successful blast furnace relighting meant the continuation of production, steady employment for workers, and a valuable contribution to the economy. They went through the final checks on the control panel, monitoring the levels of coke, iron ore, and limestone in the furnace. Every detail had to be just right. The smallest error could lead to a dangerous situation. ""Ready to begin?"" Dave asked, looking over at Derek. ""As ready as we'll ever be,"" Derek replied, his voice betraying a hint of apprehension. They both took a deep breath, and with a coordinated effort, they pressed the button to initiate the relighting process. The room was filled with a low rumble as the furnace came to life. The temperature began to rise, and the pressure built up. For the next few hours, Dave and Derek worked tirelessly, adjusting the fuel mix and monitoring the temperature and pressure levels. They knew that every minute counted. If they didn't get the relighting just right, it could mean costly downtime and a significant loss in production. Despite the pressure, there was a sense of satisfaction and pride that came with their work. They were part of a long tradition of steelworkers who had faced the challenges of the industry head-on and emerged victorious. And with each successful relighting, they were ensuring that the industry continued to thrive. As the hours passed, and the temperature and pressure levels stabilized, Dave and Derek allowed themselves a brief moment of relief. The blast furnace was back online, and another challenge had been overcome. But they knew that there would always be more challenges to face. And they were ready for them.

London taxi and private hire cab sex attacks 'at 14-year high',"Transport for London (TfL) and the Met Police have expressed concerns over the significant increase in sexual offences reported in London taxis and private hire cabs. In 2016, 164 offences were reported to police, marking a 21% rise on the previous year. Figures were only higher in 2002, when 173 offences were recorded. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) stated that they have taken a ""proactive approach"" to addressing this issue, increasing patrols in the taxi and private hire cab ranks and implementing a dedicated taxi and private hire crime team. The MPS also urged passengers to report any incidents, no matter how small, to help bring offenders to justice. TfL has also taken steps to improve passenger safety. All London taxis and private hire vehicles are required to have CCTV cameras installed, and drivers are subjected to enhanced criminal record checks. TfL has also launched a new campaign, ""Every Journey Matters,"" which encourages passengers to take simple steps to ensure their safety, such as sitting in the back seat, keeping belongings close, and reporting any suspicious activity to the driver or the control room. However, despite these efforts, victims and their families have criticized the authorities for not doing enough to prevent these attacks. In a statement, the mother of a 17-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted in a taxi last year said, ""I feel like the authorities don't take this seriously enough. They keep saying they're taking steps to improve safety, but it's not enough. My daughter was left traumatized by this experience, and I don't want any other family to go through what we went through."" The Transport Select Committee has also called on the government to take action on this issue, urging TfL and the Met Police to work together to improve passenger safety and to consider introducing measures such as mandatory driver training on sexual harassment and assault. The rise in sexual offences in taxis and private hire cabs is a significant concern for both passengers and authorities. While steps have been taken to improve safety, more needs to be done to prevent these attacks and to ensure that passengers feel safe and secure when using these modes of transport. The Met Police and TfL have pledged to continue their efforts to address this issue and to bring offenders to justice. Meanwhile, passengers are being urged to take simple steps to stay safe, such as avoiding travelling alone late at night, sitting in the back seat, and reporting any suspicious activity to the driver or the control room. By working together, authorities and passengers can help reduce the number of sexual offences in taxis and private hire cabs and ensure that everyone can travel safely and with peace of mind.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Scots NHS staff to receive pay rise denied to English,"By Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Scotland's NHS staff are set to receive a pay rise of at least 4%, while their counterparts in England will only see a 1% increase, if that, in their wages. This is in contrast to England, where staff will not be given the 1% increase recommended by the NHS pay review body. The Scottish Government announced the higher increase last week, which will come into effect from April 2023. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the decision was ""recognition of the hard work and dedication of NHS staff in Scotland."" However, the announcement has caused frustration among some health workers in England, who feel undervalued and demotivated by the lower pay increase. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), the largest nursing union in the UK, has criticised the decision, calling it a ""kick in the teeth"" for health staff. The RCN's Scotland Director, Theresa Fyffe, said: ""NHS staff in Scotland deserve this recognition, but it is a bitter pill for those in England to swallow, especially when they know they have been valued less for too long. The Scottish Government has led the way in recognising the value of NHS staff, and it is time for the UK Government to follow suit."" The Scottish Government's decision to increase NHS staff pay by 4% comes after a long period of campaigning by unions and health workers for fairer wages. The RCN and other unions have argued that NHS staff have been underpaid for too long, and that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of their role in keeping the health service running. The UK Government has defended its decision to only increase NHS pay by 1%, arguing that it is in line with inflation and that it is providing funding for other areas of the health service, such as mental health and primary care. However, critics argue that the 1% increase does not go far enough to address the real-term pay cuts that many health staff have experienced in recent years. The RCN has called for a 5% pay rise for all NHS staff, and has warned that the lower pay increase could lead to staff shortages and a worsening of the recruitment and retention crisis in the NHS. The Scottish Government's decision to increase NHS pay by 4% has been welcomed by health unions in Scotland, who have called it a ""significant step forward"" in recognising the value of NHS staff. However, the issue is likely to remain a contentious one, with health workers in England continuing to call for fairer wages and better recognition for their contribution to the NHS.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

PC Gordon Semple death: Stefano Brizzi 'spent days' with body,"Stefano Brizzi, 50, is currently in police custody, accused of the heinous crime of taking the life of PC Gordon Semple, 59. The disturbing details of this case continue to emerge, with Brizzi telling detectives that he spent several days with the body of the murdered officer, attempting to dispose of the remains in an acid bath. Brizzi's confession came after weeks of intensive investigative work by the Metropolitan Police. The discovery of Semple's body parts in a commercial acid bath in Southall, west London, on October 18, 2021, marked the beginning of the harrowing investigation. According to reports, Brizzi and Semple had met at a local pub a few days before the incident. Witnesses claim that Semple had appeared in good spirits and in good health. However, Brizzi, who was known to have a history of violent tendencies, allegedly lured Semple to his residence under the pretext of offering him a drink. Once there, Brizzi is believed to have strangled Semple in a brutal and violent attack. He then spent several days with the body, attempting to dissolve it in an acid bath in an effort to destroy any evidence of his crime. Detectives were able to piece together the events leading up to Semple's death through witness statements, CCTV footage, and forensic evidence. Brizzi's own admissions to authorities provided the crucial breakthrough in the case. The news of Semple's murder sent shockwaves through the community, with many left in disbelief at the senseless violence. Semple was a well-respected police officer, having served in the Metropolitan Police for over 30 years. He was known for his dedication to his work and his commitment to serving the community. The investigation into Semple's death is ongoing, with detectives continuing to gather evidence and interview witnesses. Brizzi remains in police custody and is expected to face charges in relation to the crime. The Metropolitan Police have reassured the public that they are doing everything in their power to bring those responsible for Semple's death to justice. They have also urged anyone with information to come forward and speak to them. The tragic loss of PC Gordon Semple is a reminder of the risks that our emergency services personnel face every day in the line of duty. It is a call to action for us all to remember the importance of supporting and respecting our public servants, and to speak out against violence and crime in our communities.

Undercover police: Legal challenge over inquiry,"Dominic Casciani, Home affairs correspondent @BBCDomCon Twitter In a significant development in the ongoing undercover police saga, a legal warning letter has been sent to the home secretary from a group of activists, claiming that one of the officers at the centre of the affair operated beyond England and Wales, potentially infringing on their human rights. The activists, who have chosen to remain anonymous for their safety, allege that the officer, known as 'Mark' or 'Mark Jacobs', engaged in relationships and collected intelligence on their activities in Scotland and Wales. This, they argue, falls outside of the jurisdiction of the English and Welsh police forces and therefore breaches their fundamental human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The letter, drafted by the legal team at Leigh Day, states that 'our clients' rights to privacy, family life and freedom of expression have been violated as a result of the actions of this undercover officer'. It goes on to demand that the home secretary take urgent steps to address these concerns, including an investigation into the extent of 'Mark's' activities outside of England and Wales and the provision of appropriate redress for the affected individuals. The home secretary's office has yet to respond to the letter, but the issue is likely to add further fuel to the growing controversy surrounding the undercover police units and their tactics. The Metropolitan Police's Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) and its successor, the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU), have been under scrutiny since it was revealed that undercover officers had formed long-term relationships with activists and infiltrated their groups over several decades. The activists' claim is particularly significant because it raises questions about the legal boundaries of undercover operations and the extent to which the police can act beyond their jurisdiction. It also highlights the potential for a wider investigation into the activities of the undercover units, particularly in relation to their operations in Scotland and Wales. The activists' legal team has also suggested that their clients may not be the only individuals affected by 'Mark's' activities outside of England and Wales. In the letter, they write that 'we are currently investigating allegations from other women and men who believe they may have been similarly targeted by this officer'. The undercover police controversy is likely to rumble on for some time yet, with calls for a full independent public inquiry growing louder. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has previously indicated that she is open to the idea of an inquiry, but has yet to make a firm commitment. In the meantime, the legal challenges and allegations continue to mount, raising serious questions about the actions of the undercover police units and their impact on the human rights of those they targeted.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Libby Squire murder trial: Accused's behaviour 'frightening',"Libby Squire, a young woman of 21 years old, disappeared after an unfortunate incident on the cold night of 31 January 2019 in Hull. The evening had started off like any other for Libby, who had planned to meet friends at a local nightclub. However, her night took an unexpected turn when she was refused entry due to being too intoxicated. As Libby left the nightclub, she was seen on CCTV walking along the street, seemingly disoriented and unsure of her direction. She was later spotted by a passerby, who noticed her acting strangely in a dark alleyway off Beverley Road. The witness, concerned for her safety, tried to help Libby, but she refused his assistance, assuring him that she was fine. However, Libby's assurances were short-lived. She was never seen or heard from again. The ensuing investigation led police to the arrest of Pawel Relowicz, a 26-year-old man who lived nearby. Relowicz, a Polish national, had been in the UK for several years and had a history of criminal convictions. During the trial, the court heard harrowing evidence of Relowicz's behaviour in the days and weeks following Libby's disappearance. The prosecution presented CCTV footage showing him in the area where Libby was last seen, as well as DNA evidence linking him to the scene. The defence argued that there was no definitive proof that Relowicz was responsible for Libby's disappearance, but the jury was not convinced. In their deliberations, they considered the circumstantial evidence and Relowicz's strange behaviour following Libby's disappearance. Relowicz had been observed acting suspiciously in the days following Libby's disappearance. He was seen driving past the scene where her body was later found several times, and he had discarded his mobile phone and changed his number. When questioned by police, Relowicz initially denied any knowledge of Libby's disappearance but later changed his story several times. The defence argued that Relowicz's behaviour could be explained by his fear of being implicated in the investigation due to his past convictions. However, the jury was unconvinced by this explanation and found Relowicz guilty of Libby's murder. The sentencing hearing was a sombre affair, with Libby's family and friends in attendance. They spoke movingly of the young woman they had lost and the pain her absence had caused them. The judge, in handing down the sentence, described Relowicz's behaviour as ""frightening"" and ""calculating"". He imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 25 years before Relowicz could be considered for parole. The Libby Squire case was a tragic reminder of the vulnerability",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Yemen's Houthis step back on threats to tax aid,"The rebel group, which has controlled the capital Sanaa and much of Yemen since 2014, had recently threatened to impose a 2% levy on humanitarian aid entering the war-torn country. This move, which was met with condemnation from both the international community and aid organizations, could have had devastating consequences for the millions of Yemenis who rely on this assistance to survive. However, in a letter seen by AFP and confirmed by the Houthis, the rebel group has stepped back on its threats. The letter, addressed to the United Nations and humanitarian organizations, stated that the group ""has decided to reconsider the previous decision"" to tax humanitarian aid. The decision to abandon the plan came following intense diplomatic pressure from various quarters. The UN, humanitarian organizations, and the international community had strongly condemned the move, warning that it could lead to a worsening of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The Houthis' initial announcement had sent shockwaves through the aid community, which has been struggling to deliver aid to Yemen amidst the ongoing conflict. The war, which began in 2015 between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government backed by a Saudi-led coalition, has resulted in what the UN has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The conflict has left over 24 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance, with 16 million people at risk of starvation. The situation has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further strained the already limited resources of the aid community. The Houthis' move to abandon the tax on humanitarian aid is a welcome development. However, it is important to remember that this is just one small step towards resolving the larger crisis in Yemen. The conflict, which is rooted in political and sectarian divisions, requires a comprehensive and sustainable solution. The international community must continue to put pressure on all parties involved in the conflict to engage in meaningful negotiations and work towards a peaceful resolution. The humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, and the world cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the suffering of its people. In the meantime, aid organizations must continue to prioritize their efforts in Yemen, working to deliver aid to those in need and advocating for the rights of the Yemeni people. The international community must also continue to support these efforts, providing the necessary resources and political backing to ensure that aid can reach those who need it most. The Houthis' decision to abandon their plans to tax humanitarian aid is a positive development. However, more needs to be done to bring an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people. The international community must continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict and ensure that aid can reach those in need.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0

Karate punching power 'all in the brain',"By Jonathan Ball, BBC News In a close-range punching contest, experts consistently out-hit novices. This intriguing finding, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, has piqued the interest of scientists seeking to understand the neurological underpinnings of exceptional punching power. Experts from the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh collaborated on this study, which involved analyzing the brains of both expert and novice karate practitioners. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during punching movements. Scientists peered deep into the brains of the experts to reveal alterations in regions controlling motor planning and execution. Specifically, they found that the primary motor cortex, located in the frontal lobe, was more active in experts than novices during punching movements. This heightened activity suggests that experts have more efficient neural networks for executing punches, enabling them to generate greater force. Moreover, the researchers observed differences in the cerebellum, a region crucial for motor coordination and timing. The cerebellum was found to be more active in experts when they performed a series of rhythmic punches. This heightened activity may help experts synchronize their movements and optimally apply power, contributing to their punching superiority. Interestingly, the researchers also discovered that activity in the supplementary motor area, which is involved in planning and monitoring complex movements, was enhanced in experts during preparation for a punch. This heightened activity could explain their superior ability to anticipate their opponents' movements and adjust their own attacks accordingly. The study's lead author, Dr. Ben Debenham from the University of Oxford's Brain and Mind Centre, commented, ""Our results suggest that the brains of expert martial artists are optimized for generating and applying force in specific ways, which enables them to outperform novices in punching contests."" This research not only sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying punching power but also opens up possibilities for training interventions to enhance motor skills in various domains. By understanding the neural underpinnings of expertise, researchers can develop targeted training programs to help individuals improve their motor abilities and reach their full potential. As the world of sports and martial arts continues to evolve, research into the neural basis of exceptional performance will undoubtedly yield valuable insights and inform future training practices. The future of punching power may very well be all in the brain.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Respite reported for Scotland's daily newspaper sales,"By Jamie McIvor, BBC News correspondent The Scotsman and The Herald both reported small increases in their circulations between April and May, offering a glimmer of respite for Scotland's daily newspaper industry. According to the latest figures published by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), The Scotsman saw a 0.3% increase, selling an average of 26,257 copies per day. Meanwhile, The Herald recorded a 0.5% rise, with an average daily circulation of 35,893. Despite these modest gains, industry experts remain cautious about interpreting the figures as a definitive trend. The Scottish newspaper market has been in decline for several years, with many readers turning to digital platforms for their news. The industry has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, as advertising revenues plummeted and circulation numbers continued to fall. The Scottish Newspaper and Publications Association (SNPA) welcomed the small increases as a positive sign, but warned that the industry still faces significant challenges. SNPA chief executive John McLaughlin said, ""These figures are a welcome relief after several years of decline, but it is important to remember that the overall trend remains downwards. The industry needs to continue to adapt to the changing media landscape and find new ways to engage with readers and advertisers."" The Scottish newspapers have responded to the declining sales by focusing on digital growth. Both The Scotsman and The Herald have seen significant increases in their online readership, with The Scotsman reporting a 22% increase in digital subscriptions in the last year. The Herald has also reported strong growth in its digital offering, with its website attracting over 1.5 million unique visitors per month. However, the shift to digital has not been without its challenges. The Scottish newspapers have had to invest heavily in digital platforms and content, while also dealing with declining print revenues. The pandemic has only added to the financial pressures, with many businesses cutting advertising budgets and individuals tightening their belts. Despite these challenges, the Scottish newspapers remain committed to their print and digital offerings. They continue to invest in quality journalism and innovative digital platforms, while also exploring new revenue streams and partnerships. The industry may be facing significant challenges, but there is also a sense of determination and resilience among the Scottish newspaper community. As McLaughlin put it, ""The Scottish newspaper industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, but we remain committed to providing high-quality journalism to our readers. These small increases are a positive sign, but we know that we need to continue to adapt and innovate if we are to thrive in the digital age."" The latest ABC figures offer a glimmer of hope for Scotland's daily newspapers, but it is clear that the industry still has a long way to go.

Essex academic's imposter 'copied work and tattoos',"Matt Lodder, senior lecturer in art history at the University of Essex, has carried out wide-ranging work into the history of body art and its significance in various cultures throughout history. His research, which has been published in numerous academic journals, explores the relationships between tattoos, power, identity, and cultural exchange. However, Lodder's meticulous work and dedication to his field have been overshadowed by a shocking revelation. It has come to light that a man, who has been posing as an academic and researcher in the same field, has been copying Lodder's work and even replicating his tattoos. The imposter, who has been identified as Mark Thompson, had been attending academic conferences, giving presentations on Lodder's research, and even publishing papers under Lodder's name. Thompson's elaborate deception went undetected for years, leaving a trail of confusion and frustration in its wake. Lodder first became aware of Thompson's activities when he received a letter from an editor of an academic journal, informing him that a paper he had submitted had already been published under a different name. Upon further investigation, Lodder discovered that the author of the published paper was none other than Thompson. ""I was shocked and disbelieving at first,"" Lodder recounted. ""I had put so much time and effort into my research, and to have someone steal my work and present it as their own was a devastating blow."" But the revelation didn't end there. Thompson had also taken things a step further by replicating Lodder's distinctive tattoos, which are based on ancient tribal markings from various cultures. Thompson's motivations for doing so remain unclear, but Lodder believes that it was an attempt to further establish his false identity as an expert in the field. The University of Essex has since taken action to address the situation, with Lodder's department issuing a statement condemning Thompson's actions and expressing their support for their colleague. The university has also contacted the relevant academic institutions and conference organizers to inform them of Thompson's deception. Despite the setback, Lodder remains committed to his research and is determined to continue making valuable contributions to the field of art history. He is also working with the university to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. ""This experience has been a difficult one, but I am grateful for the support I have received from my colleagues and the university,"" Lodder said. ""I will continue to do the work that I love and am dedicated to uncovering the fascinating stories behind the history of body art.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Apple apologises and fixes security flaw,"Dave Lee, North America technology reporter: The flaw, revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also granted unauthorized access to powerful administrative functions. Apple swiftly responded, issuing an apology and releasing a patch to address the issue. The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher who goes by the handle ""Pwn2Own"" in the annual hacking contest organized by the computer security firm Trend Micro. The researcher demonstrated the exploit, which involved sending a maliciously crafted message through iMessage, the default messaging app on Apple devices. In a statement, Apple acknowledged the issue and expressed its gratitude to the researcher for bringing it to their attention. The company asserted that the flaw affected only a small number of users and that no customer data was compromised. Apple's response came as a relief to many Mac users, who have long held the belief that their devices were less prone to viruses and malware compared to Windows PCs. The incident, however, served as a reminder that no system is entirely immune to security threats. The patch Apple released addresses the vulnerability and is available for download through the Software Update utility on Macs. Users are encouraged to install the update as soon as possible to protect their devices. The flaw was particularly concerning because it targeted iMessage, an app that is deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem. Many Mac users rely on iMessage for messaging and video conferencing, making this a potentially dangerous vulnerability. Apple also took steps to prevent similar vulnerabilities from arising in the future. They announced that they had boosted their rewards for reporting security vulnerabilities through their bug bounty program, which offers cash rewards for finding and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities. The incident underscores the importance of staying informed about security threats and keeping software up to date. While Apple's quick response and the researcher's responsible disclosure helped mitigate the damage, the potential consequences could have been much more serious. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, it is crucial that companies like Apple continue to prioritize security and respond promptly to vulnerabilities. And for users, it is essential to stay informed and use the tools available to protect their devices. Apple's swift action in addressing the security flaw is a positive sign for Mac users and a reminder that no system is completely invulnerable to threats.

Brexit: Corbyn aides warn against pre-election referendum,"By Iain Watson, Political correspondent, BBC News Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing intense pressure from within his party to rule out a pre-election referendum on Brexit, with senior aides warning that such a move could significantly delay a general election. Sources close to Mr Corbyn have indicated that he is under enormous pressure from both sides of the Brexit debate to make a definitive statement on his position before the upcoming poll. But these senior aides are concerned he is being pushed into a position which would delay a general election for some months, potentially denying Labour the opportunity to seize power and implement its policies. One senior figure close to Mr Corbyn said: ""Jeremy is under immense pressure from all sides on this issue. But we have to remember that the priority for the Labour Party is to win a general election and form a government. A pre-election referendum could potentially throw a spanner in the works."" Another senior source added: ""Jeremy's position on Brexit is well-known. He wants a new deal, but he also wants to respect the result of the 2016 referendum. But we cannot afford to let this issue dominate the election campaign. We need to focus on the issues that matter most to working-class people."" Some Labour MPs and supporters are calling for a second referendum, believing that it is the only way to break the deadlock in the House of Commons and bring closure to the Brexit saga. But others argue that such a move could split the party and alienate traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and the North of England, where many voters backed Brexit in 2016. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has indicated that his party would support a second referendum if it led to a general election. But Mr Corbyn has not yet made a definitive statement on the issue. In an interview with the BBC last week, Mr Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether he would campaign for Remain or Leave in any potential referendum, stating that his priority was to ""get a good deal for the country"". But with the deadline for the UK to leave the EU fast approaching, the pressure on Mr Corbyn to clarify his position is mounting. Some commentators believe that a pre-election referendum could help Labour win over Remain voters, who are currently more likely to support the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. But others argue that this could alienate Labour's core voter base in traditional industrial heartlands, where many voted to leave the EU in 2016.

Rory McIlroy fan hit by lightning at golf event 'bruised and shaken',"Terry Murphy, from Cookstown in Northern Ireland, described the moment his son, Ryan, 19, was hit by lightning at the PGA Tour event in Atlanta as a ""freak incident."" Mr. Murphy shared that his son had been following Rory McIlroy, the tournament's favorite, when the unexpected event occurred. Ryan, an avid golf fan, had spent the summer working in the United States, saving up to travel from tournament to tournament. His dream was to witness his idol, McIlroy, in action up close. He securely held his spot near the ropes, hoping to catch a glimpse of the professional golfer's swing and maybe even a smile or a wave. As McIlroy approached the 16th hole, the crowd grew restless with anticipation. The sun began to peek through the trees, casting long shadows on the lush fairway. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and the afternoon air grew thick with an ominous stillness. ""The lightning struck right there,"" Mr. Murphy said, pointing to a nearby tree. ""Ryan was just standing there, and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground."" According to witnesses, the lightning bolt struck Ryan in the shoulder, sending him crashing to the ground. His golfing shoes skidded across the dewy grass, leaving a trail of wet marks in the dirt. The crowd gasped in shock as McIlroy and the tournament officials rushed to Ryan's side. McIlroy, visibly shaken, cradled Ryan's head in his hands, checking for signs of life. The young man's eyes fluttered open, and he groaned in pain. Medical personnel arrived quickly and assessed Ryan's condition. Although he was bruised and shaken, the initial assessment showed no broken bones or serious injuries. Mr. Murphy, who had been watching the tournament from afar, was soon at his son's side. With relief and gratitude, he embraced his son, grateful that he was alive. McIlroy, too, appeared relieved that the incident had not resulted in more severe injuries. The PGA Tour officials announced that the tournament would be temporarily suspended due to the dangerous weather conditions. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of safety during these events and the unpredictable nature of the elements. As Ryan recovered in the hospital, his father shared that he was grateful for the quick actions of the tournament officials and McIlroy himself.

Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away',"The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA) revealed that the crucial equipment required for the Glasgow School of Art's new water mist fire safety system had arrived on site just one day before the devastating fire that engulfed the historic building in June 2014. However, the association emphasized that the installation process would have taken several weeks to complete. The water mist system, a sophisticated fire suppression technology, is particularly effective in reducing the amount of water used during a fire, minimizing water damage and limiting the fire's spread. A statement from BAFSA explained, ""The water mist system is an advanced fire suppression solution, and its successful installation demands a high degree of expertise and precision. The delayed arrival of the critical components meant that the installation could not be completed in the necessary time frame."" BAFSA went on to express their sympathy for the school and the wider community, acknowledging the significant impact the fire had on Glasgow's cultural landscape. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss caused by the tragic fire at the Glasgow School of Art. Our thoughts are with those affected by this devastating event,"" they said. The fire at the Glasgow School of Art, which is renowned for its Mackintosh building designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, began on the night of 23rd June 2014 and quickly spread, consuming much of the iconic structure. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, although initial reports suggest that an accidental ignition may have started the blaze. Following the fire, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service conducted a thorough inspection of the building to assess the extent of the damage and to determine the cause of the fire. In the aftermath, the school's rector, Tom Inns, vowed to rebuild the iconic Mackintosh building and to restore it to its former glory. The delay in the installation of the fire safety system has raised questions about the importance of deadlines and the potential consequences of rushing such critical projects. The Glasgow School of Art fire serves as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety measures and giving them the time and attention they deserve. The ongoing reconstruction of the building offers an opportunity to integrate the latest fire safety technologies and to ensure that the Mackintosh masterpiece is not only restored but also made safer for future generations.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Pakistanis respond after 'spy pigeon' detained in India,"BBC Trending What's popular and why It all started when a 14-year-old boy in an Indian village close to the border with Pakistan found a white pigeon with an unusual ring attached to its leg. The discovery, made in the rural region of Rajasthan on 30th October, quickly spread like wildfire, with local media outlets reporting that the bird was a Pakistani spy. The Indian authorities soon confirmed that the pigeon was indeed carrying a GPS device, which had been tracked to a location in Pakistan. The revelation sent shockwaves through both countries, as tensions between India and Pakistan have been running high since a deadly suicide attack in Indian-administered Kashmir earlier this month, which left at least 40 Indian paramilitaries dead. The news of the 'spy pigeon' was met with a mixture of amusement and concern on social media in Pakistan. Some users joked that the bird was just lost or had wandered across the border by mistake, while others saw it as a sign of India's desperation in the face of Pakistan's alleged support for militant groups. However, the majority of responses were more serious in tone, with many Pakistanis expressing frustration at what they saw as India's attempts to demonise their country. ""This is just another attempt by India to divert attention from the real issues,"" wrote one user on Twitter. ""The real spies are the ones sitting in India's intelligence agencies, sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan."" Others criticised the Indian authorities for what they saw as an overreaction. ""A pigeon with a GPS tracker? Seriously?"" wrote another user. ""India is spending millions on military technology and this is the best they can come up with?"" The Indian government, for its part, has claimed that the pigeon was part of a larger spying operation, and has promised to take action against Pakistan. ""We have informed the Pakistani authorities that this is a serious matter and expect them to take appropriate action,"" said Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar. However, many in Pakistan see the incident as part of a broader pattern of hostility and mistrust between the two countries. ""The real issue is the lack of trust and communication between India and Pakistan,"" wrote one user on Twitter. ""Until we address that, incidents like this will continue to happen."" Despite the heated rhetoric on social media, it's worth noting that the incident itself is relatively minor compared to the larger geopolitical issues at play. However, it does serve as a reminder of the deep-rooted tensions between India and Pakistan, and the need for dialogue and understanding if we are to move towards lasting peace in the region.

A US judge asked lawyers to explain the lyrics to Thriller,"By Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter US Tax Court Judge Mark Holmes had always been puzzled by the rap at the end of Michael Jackson's Thriller. So when the star's former lawyer, John Branca, appeared before him in 2016, Holmes seized the opportunity to seek clarification. ""Judge Holmes, I see you're a man of culture,"" Branca said, noticing the Thriller album cover on the judge's desk. ""Michael and I wrote those lyrics back in 1982. I'd be happy to explain them to you."" Holmes, an avid music fan, leaned forward in his chair. ""Please do, Mr Branca. The line about 'spending hours in dark solitude, in the heart of Hell Painted Black' has always intrigued me."" Branca chuckled. ""Ah, that's just a reference to the dark, eerie atmosphere Michael wanted to create for the song. The 'heart of Hell Painted Black' is simply a metaphor for a place of deep despair or loneliness."" The judge looked thoughtful. ""And what about 'grab a cape and see what's inside, all my plans are in motion, like a well-oiled machine?'"" ""That's Michael expressing his desire to take control of a situation, to put his plans into action,"" Branca replied. ""The 'cape' is a metaphor for a disguise or a new identity, which Michael often used in his music."" Holmes nodded, making a note in his pad. ""Finally, what about 'a glass of wine, a pipe of tobacco, I'm gonna sit back and watch it all, but first, I'm gonna have some fun now?'"" Branca grinned. ""Ah, that's the chorus of the song, Michael's invitation to join him in his world of thrills and excitement. The 'fun now' refers to the pleasurable experiences he's about to have."" Holmes leaned back in his chair, satisfied with the explanation. ""Thank you, Mr Branca. I think I have a better understanding of Thriller now. I'll allow your tax deductions related to the album."" As Branca left the courtroom, Holmes hummed the Thriller melody to himself, feeling a renewed appreciation for the iconic album and its enigmatic creator. The encounter between the judge and the lawyer shed light on the intricacies of Michael Jackson's lyrics, revealing the thought and creativity that went into crafting the Thriller album. It also underscored the importance of understanding the context and meaning behind the words, rather than just accepting them at face value.

"Belfast homeless: At least five dead since January, says charity","By Andy West, BBC News NI The Welcome Organisation, a charity that supports Belfast's homeless community, has reported at least five deaths among rough sleepers since the beginning of the year. These deaths are a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those living on the streets. No official statistics exist on the number of people who die during or immediately after experiencing homelessness. However, the Welcome Organisation's CEO, Martin Cunningham, has spoken about the mental and physical health issues that contribute to these tragic outcomes. ""We know that homelessness exacerbates existing health conditions and creates new ones,"" Cunningham said. ""Many of the people we encounter have complex needs, including mental health issues, substance abuse problems, and physical health concerns. Without access to adequate housing and healthcare services, these conditions can lead to premature deaths."" One of the most significant risks for homeless individuals is exposure to the elements. During the winter months, the cold weather can lead to hypothermia and frostbite. In addition, the lack of shelter increases the likelihood of contracting illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza. Furthermore, the stresses and uncertainties of homelessness can worsen pre-existing mental health conditions. ""Many of the people we work with struggle with anxiety and depression,"" Cunningham explained. ""The constant fear of not knowing where you'll sleep or where your next meal will come from takes a heavy toll on their mental wellbeing."" The Welcome Organisation provides essential services to help alleviate some of the challenges faced by Belfast's homeless community. Their day centre offers showers, washing facilities, and a warm place to spend the day. They also offer food and clothing, as well as support and advice for those looking to access housing and healthcare services. Despite these efforts, the demand for their services continues to grow. The charity estimates that over 700 people are homeless in Belfast at any given time. ""We're seeing more and more people coming to us for help,"" Cunningham said. ""The cost of living is increasing, and wages are not keeping pace. It's becoming harder and harder for people to afford housing."" The Welcome Organisation is calling on the government and local authorities to take action to address the root causes of homelessness and provide adequate support for those most in need. ""We need a comprehensive approach that addresses the housing crisis, provides access to healthcare services, and addresses the underlying causes of poverty and inequality,"" Cunningham said. ""Until we do that, we'll continue to see people dying on our streets."" As the weather grows colder and the days grow shorter, the need for these services becomes even more urgent.

Tube passengers forced to walk off train in Underground,"Commuters endured another day of misery when services were delayed, disrupted, or cancelled on parts of the London Underground network. The Metropolitan Line was one of the worst affected, with passengers on a train from Uxbridge to Wembley Park being forced to leave their trains and continue their journeys on foot. The incident occurred around mid-afternoon when a train hit an object on the track between Wembley Park and Finchley Road stations. The impact caused significant damage to the train's power cables, leaving it stranded with no power. Passengers were informed of the situation via recorded announcements and were advised to leave the train and make their way to the next station on foot. The unexpected disruption caused chaos and frustration among commuters, who were already dealing with the stresses of their daily commute. Many took to social media to express their anger and disappointment, with some describing the situation as a ""nightmare"" and a ""joke."" London Underground apologised for the inconvenience and advised passengers to check their journey plans before travelling. They stated that they were working to restore services as quickly as possible and urged passengers to allow extra time for their journeys. The incident comes just days after the network experienced significant disruption due to a power outage, which left thousands of passengers stranded and caused major delays. The London Underground has faced criticism for its handling of the disruptions and the lack of information provided to passengers. Despite the challenges, some commuters took the situation in their stride, with many expressing their sympathy for those who were directly affected. One passenger, who had been on the stranded train, described the experience as ""an adventure"" and was grateful that everyone had got off the train safely. The incident served as a reminder of the challenges of commuting in a major city and the importance of being prepared for unexpected disruptions. London Underground urged passengers to check their journey plans regularly and to allow extra time for their journeys. As the day drew to a close, passengers made their way home, some with longer journeys than usual, but all grateful for the safe and reliable transport system that gets them to work each day. The London Underground will continue to face challenges, but with the resilience and understanding of its passengers, it will no doubt continue to serve the people of London.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors',"By James Gallagher, Health and science reporter, BBC News website The Stanford University team, based in California, has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can diagnose skin cancer as accurately as doctors. The findings, published in the journal Nature, could pave the way for turning anyone's smartphone into a diagnostic tool. The team trained the AI system, called Derma-TL, on more than 129,000 images of moles and skin lesions. It was then tested on 26,000 images that the system had not seen before. The results showed Derma-TL matched the diagnostic accuracy of 178 board-certified dermatologists. ""The findings are incredibly exciting,"" said Dr Geoffrey Hinton, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the University of Toronto. ""We're not trying to replace doctors. Instead, we're trying to create a tool that can help doctors make better diagnoses and potentially save lives."" Dr Hinton, who is considered a pioneer in deep learning - a type of AI - added: ""We believe that everyone should have access to good healthcare and this technology could help make that a reality."" The AI system works by analysing the colour, texture, and shape of skin lesions. It can also identify the type of skin cancer - melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma - with a high degree of accuracy. The researchers now plan to test Derma-TL in clinics and in the field, where it could be used to diagnose skin cancer in remote areas. They also want to develop similar AI systems to diagnose other conditions, such as breast cancer and diabetes. Other researchers have also developed AI systems to help diagnose diseases. For example, Google's DeepMind Health has created an AI system to detect eye diseases. And IBM's Watson has been used to diagnose cancer and other conditions. But the Stanford team's system is particularly notable because of its accuracy and the fact that it can be used on a smartphone, which is readily available to most people. ""This is a significant step forward,"" said Dr Michael Keehan, a consultant dermatologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London and a spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists. ""AI has the potential to help diagnose skin cancer more accurately and more quickly than humans, which could save lives."" However, he added: ""It's important to remember that this is not a replacement for a doctor's examination. If someone has a suspicious mole or skin lesion, they should see a doctor as soon as possible."" The Stanford team's research was funded by the US National Institute of Health and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. They have also received funding from Google and Apple.

Stockholm truck attack: Who is Rakhmat Akilov?,"Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek asylum seeker, ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass on 7 April 2017, and was arrested hours later by Swedish police in connection with the Stockholm truck attack that left four people dead and 15 others injured. Akilov, who had previously been denied asylum in Sweden and was awaiting deportation, drove a stolen beer truck into a crowd of pedestrians on Drottninggatan, a popular shopping street in Stockholm, in what Swedish authorities described as a terrorist attack. Witnesses reported hearing the truck's horn blaring and seeing the vehicle mount the pavement before plowing into a number of people. Born in 1974 in the Uzbek city of Andijan, Akilov had arrived in Sweden in 2014, initially seeking asylum in Finland but later applying for asylum in Sweden. His application was rejected in 2016, and he was ordered to leave the country. However, he remained in Sweden, living in various locations and working odd jobs, including in construction and as a lorry driver. Swedish authorities had previously identified Akilov as a potential security risk. In 2016, he was detained for a short period after being found in possession of literature promoting violent jihad. Despite this, he was not held in custody and was eventually released. In the days following the attack, Akilov's social media accounts came under scrutiny. It was discovered that he had liked a number of posts promoting extremist views, and had also posted a photo of himself holding a poster bearing the Islamic State flag. Swedish authorities believe that Akilov acted alone in the attack, but are investigating whether he had any links to organized terrorist groups. Sweden's Prime Minister, Stefan LÃ¶fven, condemned the attack as a ""terrible and barbaric act of violence."" The Swedish security police, SÃ¤po, raised the country's terror threat level to its highest level, and urged the public to remain vigilant. The attack came just days after a similar truck attack in London, which left five people dead and injured dozens more. Akilov's motives for the attack remain unclear. In interviews with Swedish media, his former colleagues and acquaintances described him as a quiet, hardworking man who kept to himself. However, others reported that he had become increasingly radicalized in the months leading up to the attack. As the investigation into the attack continues, Swedish authorities will be seeking to piece together the events leading up to the attack and determine whether Akilov had any accomplices or external support. The attack has raised concerns about Sweden's asylum system and its ability to identify and deal with potential security risks. It has also renewed calls for greater cooperation between European countries in the fight against terrorism.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Egypt court quashes Red Sea islands' transfer to Saudis,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman in April that the Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred to Saudi Arabian sovereignty. The announcement came as part of broader diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries. However, the decision was met with controversy both domestically and internationally. Egyptian opposition figures and civil society groups argued that the transfer was a betrayal of Egypt's historic territorial claims and sovereignty over the islands. They pointed out that Tiran and Sanafir had been under Egyptian control since the 1950s and were crucial for securing the strategic entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. In response, the Egyptian government argued that the transfer was necessary to strengthen bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia and to secure economic benefits. They argued that the islands were economically unproductive and that the transfer would enable Egypt to focus on developing other areas of the Red Sea. Despite these arguments, the transfer was met with resistance. Protests broke out in several Egyptian cities, with demonstrators calling for the cancellation of the deal. The Egyptian parliament also called for a referendum on the issue, although this was ultimately rejected by the government. In June 2016, Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court issued a ruling quashing the transfer of the islands to Saudi Arabia. The court found that the deal had been signed without following the proper legal procedures and lacked the required parliamentary approval. The ruling was hailed as a victory for Egyptian sovereignty and a rejection of foreign interference. The ruling was a significant setback for the Egyptian government and Saudi Arabia, who had hoped to complete the transfer before the end of the year. Saudi Arabia responded by expressing its disappointment with the decision and reaffirming its commitment to Egypt-Saudi relations. The controversy over the transfer of Tiran and Sanafir highlighted the complex geopolitical dynamics of the region and the challenges faced by Egypt in balancing its diplomatic and economic interests with its sovereignty and territorial claims. Despite the ruling, the issue remains a contentious one, with the potential for further diplomatic tensions between Egypt and Saudi Arabia.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Coronavirus: Cases are recorded in 64 NI schools,"By Robbie Meredith, BBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Education (DE) in Northern Ireland revealed on Tuesday that 88 positive coronavirus cases had been recorded in 64 schools since the new term began. The figure was disclosed during a meeting of the Stormont Education Committee. The DE's Permanent Secretary, Derek Baker, acknowledged the concerns of teachers, parents, and pupils about the potential spread of the virus in educational settings. He assured the committee that the department was working closely with public health agencies to implement measures to mitigate the risk. ""Our priority remains the health and wellbeing of all pupils and staff,"" Baker said. ""We are working closely with the Public Health Agency and other stakeholders to ensure that schools have the necessary resources and support to implement the recommended public health measures."" During the session, committeemembers raised concerns about the lack of communication from schools when positive cases were identified. Baker acknowledged that there had been inconsistencies in the reporting of positive cases but assured members that the department was working to address this issue. ""We are working with the Education Authority to develop a consistent approach to reporting positive cases in schools,"" he said. ""We recognise the need for transparency and will communicate regularly with parents and the wider community."" The committee also discussed the impact of the pandemic on pupils' learning and mental health. Baker acknowledged that the past 18 months had been a challenging period for students and that there were concerns about the impact on their education. ""We are acutely aware of the impact of the pandemic on children's learning and wellbeing,"" he said. ""We are working to ensure that schools have the necessary resources to support pupils' learning and mental health. This includes additional funding for schools to address the backlog of educational catch-up."" The committee also heard from the Public Health Agency about the importance of adhering to public health measures in schools. Dr Jillian Johnston, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, stressed the importance of hand hygiene, wearing masks, and maintaining social distancing as much as possible. ""We understand that schools are challenging environments to maintain social distancing,"" she said. ""However, we would urge everyone to do their best to adhere to the public health measures to reduce the risk of transmission."" As the new term continues, the focus remains on ensuring the safety of pupils and staff in schools while minimising the disruption to their education. The DE and its partners will continue to work closely to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and to provide the necessary support to schools and their communities.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Drones hamper US firefighting efforts,"Lives were put at unnecessary risk because helicopters could not fly, said fire department officials. The helicopters were helping to contain a large wildfire in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, but their efforts were thwarted by the presence of drones in the area. The drones, which were flying recreationally, interfered with the helicopters' ability to drop water on the fire, causing the blaze to spread more rapidly. Firefighting crews on the ground were forced to focus their efforts on protecting nearby homes and structures, as the helicopters were grounded due to the drone activity. ""It's incredibly frustrating,"" said Fire Chief Jim Holland. ""We understand that people want to enjoy the beauty of the mountains and fly their drones, but when lives and property are at risk, these devices become a major hindrance."" The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has strict guidelines regarding the use of drones in areas where emergency response efforts are underway. Drones are prohibited from flying within five miles of a wildfire without prior authorization from the incident commander. But despite these regulations, drones continue to pose a threat to firefighting operations. ""We've seen this issue before, and it's only going to get worse as drone technology becomes more accessible and affordable,"" said Holland. ""We need the public's help to keep our firefighters safe and focused on the task at hand."" Fire department officials are urging the public to use common sense and refrain from flying drones near wildfires or other emergency response situations. They are also reminding people that drones can be dangerous not only to emergency responders but also to other aircraft in the area. ""We understand that people may not realize the impact their actions can have on first responders and their communities,"" said Holland. ""But we ask that they please consider the risks and stay away from wildfires and other emergency situations."" The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) is working with the FAA and local law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend individuals flying drones near wildfires. Those caught could face fines and even criminal charges. As the wildfire continued to burn, firefighters on the ground and in the air worked tirelessly to contain it. But the presence of drones remained a constant frustration, a reminder of the challenges that come with fighting wildfires in an age of advanced technology. ""We appreciate the support of the community during these difficult times,"" said Holland. ""But we ask that they please do their part by keeping drones away from wildfires and other emergency situations.""",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Baby ashes scandal 'will not happen again',"Maureen Watt made the pledge as MSPs unanimously backed the general principles of the Burial and Cremation (Scotland) Bill on Thursday. The bill was brought forward in response to the scandal at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, where it was discovered that the remains of hundreds of babies had been incinerated between the 1960s and 1990s instead of being buried. Watt, the Scottish Government's Public Health Minister, assured the Scottish Parliament that the ""shocking and distressing"" findings would not be repeated. She stated, ""We will ensure that this never happens again in Scotland."" The Bill, which received cross-party support, aims to introduce a national register for all burials and cremations, as well as provide greater transparency and accountability in the funeral industry. Watt emphasized that the proposed legislation would ""give families the confidence that their loved ones are being treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."" The Mortonhall scandal came to light in 2012 when a family visited the crematorium seeking the remains of their late baby. They were informed that the ashes had been mixed with those of other infants and scattered in the garden of remembrance. The subsequent investigation revealed that the remains of approximately 16,000 people, including 471 babies, had been mishandled over several decades. Watt acknowledged the pain and suffering that the families of the deceased had endured and apologized for any ""insensitivity or lack of compassion"" shown by the authorities involved. She emphasized the importance of learning from the past and ensuring that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated. The Bill also includes provisions for the establishment of a Scottish Cremation Commission, which will oversee the regulation of the industry and investigate any future incidents of mismanagement. Additionally, it mandates that crematoria and cemeteries must display their licenses publicly and provide detailed records to families about the handling of their loved ones' remains. Watt concluded by stating that the Bill was an important step towards restoring confidence in the funeral industry and ensuring that the mistakes of the past would not be repeated. She reiterated her commitment to working with families and stakeholders to create a ""more open, transparent, and compassionate system."" The Bill now moves to the next stage of its legislative journey, with MSPs set to consider amendments and detailed proposals in the coming weeks.

Putin critic Bill Browder freed after brief arrest in Spain,"After an hour in custody, Bill Browder, the prominent Putin critic and hedge fund manager, was released by Spanish police on Wednesday. The arrest came after a European arrest warrant, issued by a Spanish court, was executed at Barcelona El Prat airport. Mr. Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a ""politically motivated"" charge. The warrant, which was issued in absentia last year, concerned a case relating to a dead tax investigator, Sergei Magnitsky. Mr. Browder has been a vocal critic of Mr. Putin over the Magnitsky case, in which the investigator died in a Moscow detention center in 2009 after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud. Mr. Browder has long claimed that the authorities were responsible for Mr. Magnitsky's death, a charge the Kremlin denies. Speaking to the media outside the Spanish National Court in Madrid, Mr. Browder's lawyer, Nuno Lobo, confirmed that the arrest warrant had been withdrawn and that his client had been released. ""The warrant was no longer valid, and the prosecutor, the judge, and the European arrest warrant have all been revoked,"" Mr. Lobo said. Mr. Browder's arrest had caused a stir in diplomatic circles, with the United States expressing concern over the move and calling for his immediate release. The US Embassy in Madrid issued a statement on Wednesday saying that it was ""deeply troubled by reports of the arrest"" and reiterated its support for Mr. Browder. The Russian government, which has long accused Mr. Browder of being a criminal and a tax evader, welcomed the arrest. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, told reporters in Moscow that ""the legal system is working in Spain."" He added that ""if a European arrest warrant is issued, it must be executed, and that's it."" Mr. Browder's arrest came just days after he was barred from entering Montenegro, another European country, on a similar warrant. Mr. Lobo said that his client would now focus on clearing his name and continuing his work as a human rights activist. ""He is not going to be intimidated by this,"" Mr. Lobo said. ""He is going to continue to speak out about human rights abuses in Russia and around the world."" The Magnitsky case has been a source of tension between Russia and the West for years. The Magnitsky Act, a US law passed in 2012, sanctions Russians accused of human rights abuses and corruption. Russia retaliated with its own law, banning US adoptions of Russian children. Mr. Browder's arrest is likely to add to the tensions between Russia and the West at a time when relations are already strained over issues such as Ukraine and Syria.

Ben Affleck slavery row leads to TV show suspension,"Finding Your Roots, a popular PBS series similar to the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are?, delves into the ancestral lineages of celebrated figures from various walks of life. The groundbreaking show, presented by renowned historian Henry Louis Gates Jr., has captivated audiences with its revealing discoveries and emotional narratives. However, the latest episode, featuring Ben Affleck, has sparked controversy and led to the temporary suspension of the show. The episode, which aired in October 2014, saw Affleck explore his New England heritage, including his connection to Mayflower passengers. However, the actor's reaction to a potential connection to slave-owning ancestors drew criticism. During the episode, Gates revealed that one of Affleck's ancestors, Joel Ives, owned a slave named Elizabeth Fraunces. Affleck was visibly uncomfortable and asked to leave the room while the segment aired. After the episode aired, Affleck issued a statement expressing his disappointment and frustration over the revelation. The controversy quickly gained momentum, with some critics labeling Affleck's reaction as an attempt to whitewash history. The show's producers, in response, issued a statement acknowledging that the segment on Affleck's ancestry was not complete and contained inaccuracies. They also announced that they would be suspending production on the show to review and revise the segment. The episode's controversy highlights the complex and often painful nature of exploring one's family history, particularly when it involves the painful realities of slavery and its impact on American history. For many African Americans, the legacy of slavery and its ongoing effects continue to shape their experiences and identities. For white Americans, the topic can be a source of discomfort and denial, as it challenges the narrative of a national identity built on the myth of a post-racial society. The Finding Your Roots controversy also underscores the importance of accurate and responsible genealogical research. In recent years, the popularity of genealogy and ancestry research has surged, fueled by the availability of digitized historical records and DNA testing. However, the ease of access to this information can sometimes lead to incomplete or inaccurate conclusions, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics like slavery and racial history. As the producers of Finding Your Roots work to revise the segment on Ben Affleck's ancestry, they have an opportunity to use this moment as a teaching moment, highlighting the importance of accurate and respectful research when exploring America's complex past. By acknowledging the mistakes made in the initial segment and working to correct them, Finding Your Roots can continue to engage audiences with thought-provoking and informative programming while acknowledging the complex and often painful realities of American history.

Bird family tree shaken by discovery of feathered fossil,"By Helen Briggs, BBC News The turacos, or banana-eaters, are today found only in Africa, living in forests and savannah. A beautifully preserved fossil bird from 52 million years ago, discovered in Europe, is shaking up their family tree. The finding, announced in the journal Nature, challenges long-held beliefs about the evolutionary history of these colourful birds. The fossil, named Euploces europeus, was found in deposits in Germany, and its feathers have been described as ""exceptionally well-preserved"". The researchers, led by Dr Tetsuji Matsuda from the University of Manchester, say Euploces is a close relative of the turacos, but was not previously known to have lived so far north. ""This discovery is very important because it tells us that the turaco lineage was more diverse and more widely distributed geographically than we previously thought,"" Dr Matsuda said. The team made the discovery during a survey of fossil birds from the Eocene epoch, a time when many modern bird groups first appeared. They were surprised to find that the fossil's beak and skull shape closely resembled those of living turacos. ""The similarities in skull and beak morphology between Euploces and extant turacos are remarkable,"" said co-author Dr Richard Prum from Yale University. ""This fossil is the closest relative of modern turacos we have ever found."" The researchers also found evidence of pigmentation in the fossil's feathers, which could help explain why turacos are such vividly coloured birds. The findings could have implications for our understanding of other bird groups, the scientists say. ""This discovery highlights the importance of continuing to explore the fossil record to understand the evolution of living organisms,"" Dr Matsuda said. The researchers hope that further study of Euploces will shed light on the early evolution of the turaco lineage, and help explain how these birds came to be restricted to Africa today. The discovery also raises intriguing questions about how the turacos might have reached Africa from Europe in the past. Fossil evidence suggests that there were once connections between the two continents, including a land bridge that existed during the late Eocene. ""Perhaps Euploces was part of an early wave of colonisation by turacos into Africa,"" Dr Prum said. ""Or perhaps it represents a more recent dispersal event, perhaps facilitated by changing climate conditions or other factors."" The team plans to continue their research, including studies of the fossil's DNA, to learn more about the early evolution of the turaco lineage and its relationship to other bird groups.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
"Corrie Mckeague search petition signed by 21,000","Corrie McKeague, a 23-year-old former RAF regiment gunner, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds on September 24, 2016. His disappearance has left his family and friends baffled and heartbroken. On Friday, Suffolk Police confirmed that they had ended their search of waste at Milton landfill, near Cambridge, where they had been hoping to find some evidence related to Corrie's disappearance. Nicola Urquhart, Corrie's mother, expressed her disappointment and frustration over the decision, saying, ""I am absolutely devastated that the search will not continue at Milton Landfill. Corrie is my only son, and I need answers."" Despite this setback, Nicola and her supporters remain determined to keep the search for Corrie going. A petition was started on Change.org, urging Suffolk Police to continue their investigation and search for Corrie. The petition has already gathered over 21,000 signatures, with the number continuing to rise. Nicola said, ""We are not giving up. We will not stop until we find Corrie. We are appealing to anyone with information, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, to come forward and talk to the police."" Corrie was last seen in the early hours of September 24, 2016, in Bury St Edmunds, after a night out with friends. He was captured on CCTV making a phone call to his girlfriend, Gemma, at around 3:25 am, and was later seen on CCTV in the area of the Bury St Edmunds recycling centre. Despite extensive searches of the area, including the use of drones and sniffer dogs, no trace of Corrie has been found. Suffolk Police have previously stated that they believe Corrie climbed into a waste bin and was taken away in a bin lorry, but they have not been able to find any concrete evidence to support this theory. Nicola and her supporters are calling for further searches of the area, including the River Lark and the Bury St Edmunds recycling centre, as well as a review of CCTV footage from the area. They are also calling for the police to widen their investigation and consider other theories, such as Corrie having been abducted or having gone willingly with someone. The petition states, ""Suffolk Police have asked for more time and resources to investigate this case, and we believe that they owe it to Corrie and his family to do everything in their power to find him.

Liposuction rise linked to gym wear trend,"Rajiv Grover, a leading figure from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, has revealed that the latest UK data indicates a significant surge in liposuction procedures, with a notable increase of 12% within the past year. This surge brings the total number of liposuction treatments performed to 2,267. The cause of this trend, according to Grover, can be linked to the growing popularity of gym wear and activewear in daily life, both in and out of the gym. ""People are increasingly focusing on their physical appearance, especially in the areas that are difficult to target through exercise alone,"" he explained. ""Liposuction is becoming an increasingly popular option for individuals looking to achieve a toned, sculpted body."" This trend is not unique to the UK, as many other countries are reporting similar increases in liposuction procedures. In the US, for instance, there was a 5% increase in the number of cosmetic procedures in 2020, with liposuction seeing a 3% uptick. The rise in gym wear culture, fueled by the influence of social media, has led to a growing emphasis on physical fitness and appearance. ""The pandemic has also played a role in this trend,"" Grover noted. ""With people spending more time at home, they've had the opportunity to reassess their bodies and consider making improvements."" Liposuction is an effective solution for individuals who have areas of excess fat that do not respond to traditional weight loss methods. The procedure involves the use of a thin tube called a cannula to remove fat cells from beneath the skin, resulting in a smoother, more contoured appearance. However, it's important to note that liposuction is not a weight loss solution and should be approached as a body contouring treatment. Prospective patients are advised to have realistic expectations and to maintain a healthy lifestyle post-procedure. Grover also emphasized the importance of choosing a qualified and experienced surgeon for the procedure. ""While liposuction is a safe and effective treatment when performed by a qualified professional, there are risks involved,"" he said. ""It's crucial that individuals take the time to research their surgeon and ensure they have the necessary qualifications and experience."" As the trend towards gym wear and active lifestyles continues to grow, it's likely that the demand for liposuction and other body contouring procedures will also increase. However, it's important for individuals to approach these treatments with a clear understanding of their goals and the potential risks and benefits involved. In conclusion, the latest data from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons shows a 12% increase in liposuction procedures within the past year, a trend that can be linked to the growing popularity of gym wear and activewear.

City sanguine on snap election call,"Simon Jack, Business Editor: The pound has gained 1% against the euro and the dollar this morning, despite the unexpected call for a snap election on June 8th. Although the stock market is down more than 2%, a lot of that happened before Theresa May's announcement. Investors had been growing increasingly anxious about the direction of Brexit negotiations, with the lack of a clear majority in Parliament making progress uncertain. The Prime Minister's decision to call an early election was seen by some as a move to strengthen her hand in the talks, and as a result, the markets reacted positively. Sterling's rise was also attributed to the belief that a clear Conservative victory would reduce the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process and potentially lead to a so-called 'soft Brexit'. The pound had been under pressure in recent weeks, with many investors betting on a 'hard Brexit' scenario, which would see the UK leave the EU single market and customs union. The FTSE 100, on the other hand, was down, with mining and oil stocks leading the declines. This was due in part to the strength of the pound, which makes the companies' earnings less valuable when converted back into sterling. The election call also brought renewed focus on the Labour Party and its economic policies. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to renationalise key industries such as rail, energy and water, which has raised concerns among business leaders. The party has also called for higher corporation tax and a living wage of Â£10 an hour, which some believe could deter investment. Despite these concerns, there are those who believe that a Labour victory could actually be good for the economy in the longer term. The party's plans for increased public investment in areas such as infrastructure and housing could stimulate growth, and its commitment to tackling inequality could help to reduce the social tensions that have contributed to the UK's productivity puzzle. Overall, the snap election call has brought renewed uncertainty to the markets, with investors unsure about the potential policy implications of a Labour victory. However, there is also a sense that a clear Conservative majority could provide some much-needed clarity on the Brexit process and help to boost business confidence. As we head towards the election, it is clear that the economic implications will be a major battleground between the parties. The next few weeks are likely to be a rollercoaster ride for investors, so buckle up and hold on tight.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Foals: Oxford band go from squat parties to Albert Hall,"By Greg Cochrane, Newsbeat music reporter ""There were two things we didn't want to do,"" recalls frontman Yannis Philappakis as he sits in the dimly lit living room of Foals' Oxford headquarters. ""One was not make music that sounded like everyone else in the city. The other was not play in the same old venues."" Before they were the critically acclaimed, Mercury Prize-nominated band that sold out the Albert Hall, Foals were a group of friends from Abingdon School in Oxford, united by their love for alternative music. ""We all grew up listening to bands like Radiohead, My Bloody Valentine, and The Smiths,"" Yannis explains. ""We wanted to create something new, something that wouldn't be pigeonholed as 'Oxford music'."" Their early gigs were held in squats and DIY spaces around the city, with the band members often pulling double duty as promoters and sound engineers. But their determination paid off. Word of their raw, energetic live shows began to spread, and before long, they were attracting the attention of local music tastemakers and industry professionals. ""We were lucky to have people like NME and BBC Introducing take an interest in us early on,"" says Yannis. ""It gave us a platform to reach a wider audience and build a fanbase."" But with success came growing pains. The band's line-up underwent several changes as they honed their sound and refined their craft, and the pressures of expectation began to take a toll. ""There were times when we felt like we were losing sight of why we started in the first place,"" admits Yannis. ""But we always managed to pull through, and every challenge we faced made us stronger."" Foals' breakthrough came in 2008 with the release of their debut album, ""Antidotes,"" which was met with widespread critical acclaim. They went on to release four more studio albums, each building on the foundation laid down by their first. Now, as they gear up for the release of their sixth album, Foals are reflecting on the journey that has brought them from the squat parties of Oxford to the hallowed halls of the Albert Hall. ""It's been a wild ride, and we're grateful for every moment of it,"" says Yannis with a smile. ""But at the end of the day, we're just five guys from Oxford who love making music.

Samsung Odyssey virtual reality headset announced for Windows,"By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor The HMD Odyssey, Samsung's new virtual reality (VR) headset, has been announced for Windows PCs, adding to the range of devices available for Microsoft's new Mixed Reality platform. The headset joins previously announced VR headsets and hand controllers from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Asus. Unlike earlier PC-based VR kit, Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform is designed to offer a more affordable and accessible VR experience. The technology uses internal sensors, along with those built into the headset and controllers, to track the user's movements in three dimensions, without the need for external sensors or cameras. The Samsung HMD Odyssey boasts a resolution of 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye, which is higher than the 1080p resolution of some of its competitors. It also has a wide field of view, measuring 110 degrees, which is similar to the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The headset features built-in AKG headphones, which promise high-quality spatial audio, allowing users to hear 3D sounds in all directions. The headphones can be detached, giving users the option to use their own headphones if they prefer. Samsung's Mixed Reality headset also comes with two wireless controllers, which can be used to interact with virtual objects in the VR environment. Each controller includes a joystick, two buttons, a touchpad, and two triggers, providing a good range of input options. The HMD Odyssey is expected to be available in the coming weeks, with a price tag of $499 (Â£377). This is at the higher end of the price range for Mixed Reality headsets, but still undercuts some of the more expensive VR headsets on the market, such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform is set to offer a wide range of experiences, from educational and training applications, to games and entertainment. The platform will be accessible through the Windows Store, and users will be able to download and install VR experiences directly onto their PCs. The Samsung HMD Odyssey is the latest in a line of Mixed Reality devices to be announced for the Windows platform, and it promises to deliver a high-quality VR experience at an affordable price point. With a resolution higher than many of its competitors and built-in headphones, it could be an attractive option for those looking to explore the world of virtual reality. However, it remains to be seen whether the lower price point and ease of use of Mixed Reality headsets will be enough to win over fans of more expensive, high-end VR headsets.

National Farmers' Union condemns flooding plans,"Engineers have proposed creating ponds and bogs on high ground as part of a new flood prevention scheme, aimed at reducing the risk of devastating floods by slowing down rainwater as it makes its way down hills. However, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has expressed concerns over the potential impact of such plans on farming communities and their land. According to the NFU, the implementation of these flood prevention measures could lead to significant disruptions for farmers and their businesses. The creation of new ponds and bogs could result in the loss of valuable agricultural land, impacting crop production and livestock rearing. Furthermore, the NFU has raised concerns over the potential for increased waterlogging in existing farmland, which could result in crop failure and reduced productivity. The Union estimates that around 1.5 million acres of farmland in the UK are at risk of waterlogging, and the implementation of these flood prevention measures could exacerbate this issue. The NFU has called on the government and local authorities to consult with farmers and consider alternative flood prevention measures that would have a lesser impact on agricultural land. One such measure could be the use of natural flood management techniques, such as tree planting and the restoration of wetlands. NFU Deputy President, Stuart Roberts, said: ""Farmers are at the frontline of managing and mitigating the impacts of flooding on their land, and we understand the importance of taking action to prevent future flooding. However, any flood prevention measures must be carefully considered to ensure they do not cause significant disruptions to farming businesses, and that alternative measures are explored where possible."" The NFU's concerns come as the government has pledged to invest Â£5.2 billion in flood defences over the next six years. The funding will be used to strengthen existing defences and build new ones, with a particular focus on areas that have been hardest hit by flooding in recent years. The government has acknowledged the need to balance the need for flood prevention measures with the impact on farming communities, and has pledged to work closely with farmers and the farming industry to find solutions that work for all parties. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the importance of farming communities and the impact that any flood prevention measures could have on their livelihoods. That's why we are committed to working closely with farmers and the farming industry to find solutions that reduce the risk of flooding while minimising disruption to their businesses."" As the debate continues over the best way to prevent flooding and protect farming communities, it is clear that a balanced approach is needed to ensure that the needs of farmers and the environment are taken into account. The government and local authorities must work closely with farmers and the farming industry to find solutions that are effective, sustainable, and fair to all concerned.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Welsh Conservative leader contender Paul Davies 'not grey',"By Aled ap Dafydd, BBC Wales political correspondent The interim leader of the Tory assembly group has been described by a party insider as ""not grey"" and ""full of energy"" ahead of the upcoming Welsh Conservative leadership contest. Paul Davies, the Member of the Senedd for Preseli Pembrokeshire, is seen as a frontrunner for the role, and his enthusiasm and charisma are said to have impressed many within the party. Davies, who was first elected to the Senedd in 2011, has built a reputation as a strong and effective assembly member. He has served on various committees, including the Health and Social Care Committee and the European and External Affairs Committee. In 2015, he was appointed as the Deputy Minister for Farming and Food in the Welsh Government, a role he held until 2016. Despite his experience in Welsh politics, Davies has faced criticism from some within his own party for his perceived closeness to the Labour-led Welsh Government. However, he has dismissed such claims and has emphasised his commitment to the Conservative cause. One of Davies' most notable achievements in recent months came during the pandemic, when he successfully campaigned for the Welsh Government to allow drive-through testing centres to be set up in Pembrokeshire. The move was welcomed by many in the county, who had previously faced long waits for COVID-19 tests. Another area where Davies is seen as a strong performer is in his constituency. Preseli Pembrokeshire has been a Tory stronghold for decades, but Davies has worked hard to engage with local communities and address their concerns. He has been praised for his approachability and responsiveness, and has built up a strong following among voters in the area. However, Davies faces stiff competition in the leadership contest. Other contenders include Jane Dodds, the current leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, and Mark Reckless, a former Conservative MP who defected to UKIP before rejoining the Tories in 2019. Despite the challenges ahead, Davies remains upbeat about his chances. He has pledged to unite the party and focus on issues that matter to people in Wales, such as the economy, education, and healthcare. With the leadership contest set to be a closely-watched battle, Davies will need to continue to impress party members and voters if he is to secure the top job. But with his energy, enthusiasm, and proven track record, he is certainly a force to be reckoned with.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Iceland mayors object to Google snow,"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring In a surprise turn of events, mayors from several Icelandic towns have voiced their objections to Google's high-definition imagery of their areas, specifically during the winter season when snow is abundant. JÃ³n PÃ¡ll Hreinsson, the mayor of BolungarvÃ­k in the picturesque Western Fjords region, has raised concerns that this could put overseas tourists off visiting the area. The issue at hand is not the accuracy of the imagery but rather the perception it creates. BolungarvÃ­k, with its quaint islands and fishing villages, is marketed as a winter wonderland destination. However, the Google Earth images, which capture the town in pristine white, have led some potential visitors to believe that the snow cover is perpetual. ""The problem is that the images give a false impression of our town,"" Hreinsson explained. ""While we do experience heavy snowfall during the winter months, it does not always last. Tourists might be disappointed if they arrive expecting a winter wonderland but find that the snow has melted."" This is not an isolated incident. Mayors from Reykjavik and Akureyri have also expressed similar concerns. They argue that the misrepresentation of their towns could negatively impact tourism, especially during the shoulder seasons when visitor numbers are lower. Google has yet to respond to the mayors' concerns. However, the company has a history of collaborating with local authorities to update its imagery. In 2018, Google worked with the Swiss government to remove images of avalanche-prone areas from its platform to ensure public safety. The mayors' objections highlight the growing influence of technology on tourism promotion. While virtual tours and high-definition imagery can be valuable tools for potential visitors, they can also create unrealistic expectations. It remains to be seen how Google will address the concerns raised by the Icelandic mayors and whether other destinations will follow suit. In the meantime, tourists planning a trip to Iceland are advised to check the local weather conditions before travelling, especially during the winter months when snow cover can be variable. The country's tourism board, Promote Iceland, has promised to provide up-to-date information on weather conditions and seasonal attractions to help visitors make informed decisions. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology for travel planning, it is essential that accurate and realistic information is provided to ensure that tourists have a positive experience. The Icelandic mayors' concerns serve as a reminder of the importance of balancing technological innovation with realistic representation.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Hinkley Point C nuclear emissions 'underestimated',"The Stop Hinkley group, an organization that has long been critical of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, has raised concerns that the plant's emissions of radioactive waste into the Severn Estuary will be greater than previously estimated. The group's complaint relates to three permits issued by the Environment Agency for the running of the plant, which they believe do not accurately reflect the true level of radiation that will be discharged. According to the group, the permits fail to take into account the latest data on the radioactive inventory of the reactor fuel, as well as the expected performance of the plant's filtration systems. They argue that this could result in significantly more radioactive material being released into the environment than previously anticipated. However, the Environment Agency has defended its decision to issue the permits, stating that they are based on the best available scientific information and that they comply with all relevant regulations. The agency also pointed out that the permits include stringent monitoring requirements to ensure that any discharges of radioactive material are kept within acceptable levels. The Stop Hinkley group has called on the agency to reconsider its decision and to carry out a full review of the permitting process. They argue that the potential risks to the environment and to human health are too great to overlook. The controversy over the permits is just the latest in a long line of disputes surrounding the Hinkley Point C power station. The project, which is being built by French energy giant EDF, has been dogged by delays and cost overruns, and has faced strong opposition from local residents and environmental groups. Critics of the plant argue that the risks of nuclear power are too great, and that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power offer a safer and more sustainable alternative. They also point out that the plant will be one of the most expensive in the world to build, and that the cost will ultimately be borne by energy consumers. Supporters of the plant, however, argue that it is essential for meeting the UK's energy needs and reducing its carbon emissions. They also point out that the plant will create jobs and provide a reliable source of electricity, unlike renewable energy sources which can be intermittent. The debate over the permits and the future of the Hinkley Point C power station is likely to continue for some time, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence. In the meantime, the Environment Agency will continue to monitor the situation closely and to take any necessary action to protect the environment and human health.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
'Law change needed' to stop sale of 'legal highs',"The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents 400 councils in England and Wales, has called on the government to adopt a more proactive approach in regulating the sale of legal highs. Instead of relying on the current piecemeal ban on specific substances, the LGA wants to see a comprehensive ban on all new psychoactive substances (NPS), also known as legal highs. Ireland's experience with such a ban has shown promising results. In May 2017, Ireland introduced the Psychoactive Substances Act, which criminalized the production, sale, and possession of all new psychoactive substances, with some exceptions for substances used in medical treatment, industrial processes, and essential research. The Irish ban has led to a significant reduction in the availability and use of legal highs. According to a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the number of new psychoactive substances detected in Ireland dropped from 22 in 2015 to 3 in 2018. In contrast, the UK saw an increase in the number of new psychoactive substances detected, with 131 new substances identified in 2018. The LGA argues that the current regulatory framework in the UK is not effective in preventing the sale and use of legal highs. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, which governs the control of drugs in the UK, relies on a list of banned substances, and new substances can only be added to the list after a lengthy and costly process. This leaves a regulatory gap, allowing new psychoactive substances to enter the market before they can be banned. The LGA also points to the impact of legal highs on local authorities, who are often left to pick up the pieces of the damage caused by their use. The association estimates that the annual cost to local authorities of dealing with the consequences of legal highs, such as anti-social behavior, healthcare, and policing, is Â£100 million. The Irish approach, which bans all new psychoactive substances until proven safe, would provide a much-needed solution to this problem. The LGA argues that such an approach would give law enforcement agencies the necessary legal tools to tackle the issue head-on, without the need for lengthy and costly regulatory processes. The Irish ban has also been welcomed by public health experts, who argue that the focus should be on prevention rather than treatment. Dr. Rosanna O'Connor, the director of public health at Public Health England, has called for a similar approach in the UK, stating that ""it is important that we take a proactive approach to these substances and seek to prevent their availability and use in the first place."" The LGA's call for a comprehensive ban on new psychoactive substances is",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Jeff Koons' Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist,"Christie's in New York made headlines this week with the sale of Jeff Koons' iconic Rabbit sculpture, which fetched a record-breaking price for a living artist at auction. The 41-inch (104cm) steel cast of an inflatable rabbit, created in 1986, was sold for more than $20 million. The Rabbit sculpture, which is one of Koons' most recognizable works, is part of his 'Balloon Dog' series. The sculpture is an exaggerated representation of a rabbit, with oversized ears and a shiny, polished surface. It was inspired by a childhood memory of Koons' father inflating a rabbit balloon for him. The Rabbit sculpture has a fascinating backstory. It was first exhibited in 1990 at the Gagosian Gallery in New York, where it caused a stir among art critics and collectors. The sculpture was sold to a private collector for $1.5 million, which was a significant sum at the time. However, the Rabbit sculpture truly came into its own in 2013 when it was sold at Christie's for a record-breaking $9.5 million. The sale set a new auction record for a living artist's sculpture. But this latest sale of the Rabbit sculpture has eclipsed that record, making it the most expensive living artist's sculpture ever sold at auction. The identity of the buyer remains a closely guarded secret, but it is believed that the sculpture was sold to a private collector. The sale of the Rabbit sculpture is a testament to Jeff Koons' enduring influence in the art world. Koons, who was born in 1955 in York, Pennsylvania, is known for his provocative and playful works that challenge traditional notions of art. His works often incorporate everyday objects, such as balloons, inflatable toys, and vacuum cleaners, and elevate them to the status of high art. Koons' approach to art has been described as ""post-modern"" and ""pop,"" and his works are often controversial and polarizing. Despite the controversy surrounding his works, Koons has been the subject of numerous exhibitions and retrospectives around the world. His works are held in the collections of major museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The sale of the Rabbit sculpture is a significant moment in the art world, not just for the record-breaking price it fetched, but for the way it challenges our perceptions of what art can be. The Rabbit sculpture is more than just a polished steel representation of a rabbit; it is a symbol of the power of the imagination and the ability of art to transform the mund",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Covid: Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix called off for second year,"The Isle of Man's classic motorcycle races, the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix, have been cancelled for the second consecutive year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The events were due to be held from 22 August until 3 September. The news follows the announcement on Monday that the island's border will not fully reopen until September. Enterprise Minister Laurence Skelton confirmed the decision in a statement, expressing his regret for the inconvenience caused to racing enthusiasts and participants. He acknowledged the economic impact the cancellation would have on the island but emphasized the importance of public health and safety. ""It is with deep regret that we have taken the decision to cancel this year's Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix races. I am aware of the economic benefits these events bring to the island and the disappointment this decision will cause for many,"" Skelton stated. ""However, the safety and wellbeing of our residents, visitors, and participants must always be our priority. Given the uncertainty surrounding international travel and the ongoing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, it is not feasible to proceed with the races as planned,"" he added. The Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix are renowned for attracting thousands of spectators and racers from across the globe. The races are a significant part of the island's cultural heritage and contribute significantly to its economy. The decision to cancel the races comes after the Isle of Man Government announced that its borders would not fully reopen until September. This decision was made in response to the continued spread of the Covid-19 delta variant and the uncertainty surrounding international travel. Although the races have been cancelled, the Department for Enterprise is working to offer alternative experiences for motorcycle enthusiasts. ""We are exploring other ways to celebrate the TT and motorcycling on the island this year, and we will provide further updates in due course,"" Skelton said. The Department for Enterprise is also working closely with the organisers of the races to ensure a successful return in 2022. ""We will continue to work closely with the organisers of the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix to ensure a fantastic event next year,"" Skelton added. The cancellation of the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix marks another blow to the events industry, which has been severely impacted by the pandemic. Despite the challenges, organisers and governments around the world continue to explore ways to safely deliver events and bring people together, even if it means doing so virtually or with reduced capacity.

National Museum Wales boss issues job cuts warning,"By Huw Thomas, BBC Wales arts and media correspondent David Anderson, the director-general of Amgueddfa Cymru â National Museum Wales, has spoken out about the potential for job cuts within the organisation following the rejection of a pay offer to staff involved in a long-running dispute. In an exclusive interview with BBC Wales, Anderson expressed his disappointment at the rejection of the proposed 1.5% pay rise, which he maintained was all the museum could afford in the current economic climate. He acknowledged the difficulty and frustration felt by the staff, many of whom have not had a pay increase for several years. ""I understand the anger and frustration of our staff, who have been working tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep our museums open and engaging for visitors,"" Anderson said. ""But I must also be realistic about the financial situation we find ourselves in. The museum receives no central government funding for salaries, and our income has been severely impacted by the closure of our sites and the reduction in visitor numbers due to the pandemic."" Anderson went on to warn of the potential for job losses if a resolution to the dispute could not be reached. ""We are facing a significant financial deficit, and we cannot continue to absorb the costs of the pay dispute indefinitely. I am deeply concerned about the impact this could have on our staff and our visitors. We are exploring all options to mitigate the need for job cuts, but I cannot rule it out at this stage."" The pay dispute has been ongoing for several years, with the Museum and Union (MU) arguing that their members' salaries have not kept pace with inflation. The MU has also criticised the museum's management for what it sees as an unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations. In response to Anderson's comments, MU spokesperson Cate Hopkins said the union was ""disappointed and frustrated"" by the director-general's stance. ""Our members have been working under immense pressure throughout the pandemic, and they deserve better than this. We will continue to press for a fair and equitable solution to the pay dispute."" Anderson acknowledged the importance of finding a resolution to the dispute, but he also emphasised the need for financial responsibility. ""I share the frustration of our staff, and I am committed to finding a way forward that is fair to all. But we must also be mindful of the financial realities of the museum. We cannot continue to incur the costs of the pay dispute without causing serious damage to our organisation."" As the negotiations continue, the future of the pay dispute and the potential for job cuts hangs in the balance. The situation serves as a reminder of the financial challenges facing cultural institutions in the wake of the pandemic, and the need for a collaborative and equitable approach to finding solutions.

The many ways to say sorry in Japanese,"In English, you either say ""sorry"" or ""apologies."" In Japanese, however, there is a rich and nuanced vocabulary for expressing regret and remorse. The Japanese language offers at least 20 different ways to say ""sorry,"" each carrying its unique meaning and connotation. One of the most casual and most frequently used words is ""gomen"" ããã. ""Gomen"" is the contraction of ""gomen nasai"" ããããªãã, which directly translates to ""I'm sorry"" in English. It is a versatile word that can be used in various situations, from a minor mistake to a more significant offense. The tone of ""gomen"" is generally light and polite, making it an ideal word for everyday apologies. Another common word for apologizing in Japanese is ""ossharu"" ãããã, which is derived from the verb ""sharu"" ããã, meaning ""to be at fault."" This word is often used when acknowledging a mistake and taking responsibility for it. ""Ossharu"" carries a slightly more serious tone than ""gomen,"" but it is still a relatively casual way to apologize. For more formal situations, there are several other expressions to choose from. ""Wakarimasen deshita"" ãããã¾ããã§ãã means ""I didn't realize,"" and it is often used when apologizing for unintentionally causing harm or inconvenience. ""Sumimasen, tanoshimi ni"" ãã¿ã¾ãããéè«ã« means ""Excuse me, I digressed,"" which can be used when acknowledging a lapse in concentration or focus during a conversation. One of the most profound expressions of apology in Japanese is ""anshin toitomari deshita"" å®å¿ã¨ãã¨ãããã§ãã. This phrase translates to ""I failed to ensure your peace of mind,"" and it is often used when apologizing for causing significant distress or harm to someone. This expression carries a deep sense of remorse and a commitment to making things right. In Japanese culture, apologizing is an essential part of maintaining relationships and restoring harmony. The language offers a wide range of expressions to suit different situations and levels of remorse. Whether it's a casual ""gomen"" or a profound ""anshin toitomari deshita,"" there is a word in Japanese to express the depth of your apology.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
Damascus military facilities 'hit by Israel rockets',"Syrian state media reported on Tuesday evening that several military facilities in and around Damascus had been struck by Israeli rockets. The most significant attack was said to have targeted the Jamraya research centre, located around 20 kilometers north of the Syrian capital. Western officials have long suggested that this facility is involved in the production and storage of chemical weapons. Israeli radio quoted a senior security official confirming the strikes, but the Israeli military has yet to make an official statement on the matter. The Syrian government, for its part, denounced the attacks as a dangerous escalation and a clear violation of international law. ""This aggression will not weaken the determination of the Syrian people and army to confront terrorist groups and defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" a statement from the Syrian Foreign Ministry read. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have not commented on the report, but Israeli media outlets have suggested that the strikes were in response to recent threats from Iran and its proxy forces in Syria. Iranian-backed militias have been accused of launching several attacks against Israeli targets in recent months, including a drone strike on the Golan Heights in February. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 13 people were killed in the strikes, including eight civilians. The Jamraya research centre is located in a densely populated area, and there are concerns that the use of rockets could result in civilian casualties. The attacks come at a delicate time for the region, with tensions already high between Israel and Iran. The US has also increased its military presence in the Middle East in recent weeks, citing concerns about Iranian aggression. The Syrian conflict, which began in 2011, has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more. The civil war ended officially in 2018, but the country is still plagued by insecurity and instability, with various armed groups operating in different parts of the country. Israel has carried out several airstrikes against Syrian targets in the past, but the attacks on Tuesday were the most significant in recent memory. The Israeli military has previously justified such strikes as necessary to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that is backed by Iran. The international community has condemned the attacks, with the UN Security Council expected to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation. The US, Russia, and other permanent members of the Security Council are likely to issue statements condemning the use of force and calling for de-escalation. The situation in Syria and the broader Middle East remains complex and volatile, and the attacks on Tuesday are likely to add to the tensions in the region.

Caption mix-ups 'show lack of respect' for black MPs,"The Evening Standard, a London-based newspaper, recently made headlines for a caption mix-up that has sparked controversy and accusations of disrespect towards two black Labour MPs. In their online article published on March 25, 2023, the paper featured a photograph of Bell Ribeiro-Addy MP while reporting on a story about Marsha de Cordova MP. The image caption accompanying the photograph read, ""Marsha de Cordova MP, who was appointed as the Minister for Children and Families last week."" This error led to a wave of criticism from readers and both MPs themselves, as Bell Ribeiro-Addy is not the newly appointed Minister for Children and Families. De Cordova took to Twitter to express her disappointment, stating, ""It's really disappointing to see this kind of error in a national newspaper. Misrepresentation and inaccuracy in reporting is not acceptable."" Ribeiro-Addy also responded, ""Appreciate the confusion but I am not the Minister for Children and Families. Important to ensure accuracy in reporting, particularly when it comes to public figures."" This incident is not an isolated occurrence, as there have been numerous instances of similar caption mix-ups, often involving black public figures. In 2019, the BBC faced backlash for using a photo of Diane Abbott MP instead of Dawn Butler MP in a tweet about a housing policy announcement. The error was quickly corrected, but the damage to the reputation of both MPs had already been done. These incidents are not only disrespectful to the individuals involved, but they also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce negative biases. Misrepresentation in media can have serious consequences, particularly for public figures who rely on accurate reporting to effectively represent their constituents and further their political agendas. It is essential for media outlets to prioritize factual accuracy and avoid careless errors that can harm individuals and contribute to negative stereotypes. This requires a commitment to diverse and inclusive hiring practices, as well as ongoing training and education for staff to ensure they are equipped to report accurately on a diverse range of issues and individuals. The Evening Standard has since issued an apology for the error and assured its readers that they are taking steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. However, this incident serves as a reminder that there is still much work to be done to address the systemic issues of bias and inaccuracy in media reporting. As we continue to strive for greater representation and inclusion in media, it is crucial that we hold ourselves and our institutions accountable for accurate reporting and the fair treatment of all public figures, regardless of their race or ethnicity.",Ai,English,BBC,Continue,open-mistral-7b,0
